Claudication refers to muscular pain that develops with exercise and improves with rest caused by the impaired ability of the narrowed arteries to provide adequate blood flow\nto muscles during exercise. PAD can progress lo cause chronic extremity ischemia, rest pain, ulceration, and gangrene. Diagnosis is typically made by evaluation of ankle brachia! systolic pressure indices,\nwith a score of less than 0.90 being indicative of PAD, or vascular imaging. Risk factors for development include obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, male sex, older age,\nand concomitant arterial disease elsewhere. Treatment is supportive, although severe occlusive disease may be treated with surgical revascularization. This patient presents with low back and buttock\nclaudication, erectile dysfunction, and diminished peripheral pulses, making aortoiliac occlusion the most likely diagnosis.",

In severe cases, mediastinal structures may be stretched or compressed, compromising\nvenous return, resulting in obstructive shock (known as a tension pneumothorax). On physical examination, a pneumothorax presents as unilateral diminished breath sounds with hyperresonance to\npercussion. Pneumothorax can appear on chest x-ray as radiolucent air and the absence of interstitial lung markings in the pleural space adjacent to the lung parenchyma. If a pneumothorax is large, tube\nthoracostomy should be performed to evacuate the air in the pleural space to aid in lung re-expansion. Once a chest tube is placed and healing of the inciting injury occurs, leakage of air into the pleural\nspace should stop. If a persistent air leak is noted, the source of the leak should be investigated. A ruptured bronchus requires extended time to heal and is a potential source of air leak. If the leak persists,\nsurgical correction of the rupture may be required to prevent chronic pneumothorax from a resultant bronchopleural fistula.",

The underlying cause is incompletely understood but involves formation of antiplatelet\nlgG antibodies with subsequent platelet opsonization and phagocytosis by splenic macrophages. The diagnosis is one of exclusion after other potential causes of thrombocytopenia, such as viral infection,\nhematologic malignancy, and adverse effects of medication have been ruled out. Bone marrow biopsy will most likely show an increased number of megakaryocytes indicating adequate platelet production\nbut increased peripheral destruction of platelets. Platelets appear normal on peripheral blood smear. Coagulation studies are also normal, although bleeding lime is prolonged. ITP often occurs following an\ninfection, frequently with Helicobacter pylori, Epstein-Barr virus, or HIV, and is generally self-limited. Chronic ITP is first treated with steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or immunomodulatory drugs.\nRefractory ITP is treated with splenectomy, which results in remission of thrombocytopenia in most cases.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This newborn patient has undergone premature delivery, likely during the first or early second trimester of pregnancy, as evidenced by the newborn's size, incompletely developed eyes, nipples, and\nextremities, and lack of lanugo (body hair that typically develops in the 4th or 5th month of gestation). Premature delivery in early pregnancy results in stillbirth caused by incomplete development of the\nneonatal lungs and brain, which do not complete their maturation until the end of the second trimester. The diagnosis of death in newborns requires a careful examination, which may be complicated by the\nfact that many reflexes are not fully developed, and ocular examination (as well as examination of corneal, vestibular, and oculocephalic reflexes) may be impossible. Apnea testing is a reliable method for\ndiagnosing death and involves providing adequate oxygenation via ventilator, followed by observation of a rise in carbon dioxide levels caused by lack of spontaneous respirations as the ventilator is\nweaned. EEG is not usually necessary, but, if performed, demonstrates electrocerebral silence, or lack of electrical waveforms. In the setting of death in a nonviable, premature newborn, it is appropriate to\ndiscontinue resuscitative efforts. Generally, any fetus of less than gestational age 22 to 23 weeks (depending on the particular center caring for the child) will be nonviable, and resuscitation efforts would be\ninappropriate.",

Respiratory depression can\ncause hypercarbia, which can lead to altered mental status, coma, and seizures. Opioid overdose can also lead to respiratory arrest and death. Given this patient's respiratory rate of 6 breaths per minute,\nhydromorphone overdose leading to hypoventilation and hypercarbia is the most likely cause of her change in level of consciousness. This is further supported by miosis on examination, a common sign of\nopioid intoxication.

Brief stiffness in the morning may occur with OA\nbut typically resolves within about 1 hour. The diagnosis is clinical, although plain film x-rays may be helpful and often show Joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis. First-line\ntreatment of OA includes acetaminophen. Other medications include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), although these should be avoided in patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or\nchronic kidney disease.

When the power of a study is increased, the incidence of a type II error\ndecreases. A type II error occurs when a study demonstrates no difference between the null and alternative hypotheses, when in fact, a difference exists. The type II error rate is calculated by subtracting\nthe power from 100%. A meta-analysis is a form of study in which statistical analysis is performed lo combine the results of multiple studies addressing the same question. Meta-analysis is useful for\novercoming limitations of the constituent studies within the meta-analysis. By pooling the results of multiple studies, meta-analyses reduce the risk for type II error caused by the smaller sample sizes within\neach constituent randomized controlled trial.

AR is calculated as the difference between disease or outcome incidence among those with the exposure and those without the exposure. In biostatistics, the\nlowercase letters a, b, c, and dare frequently used to represent numbers of patients exposed to a risk, receiving an intervention, or having a disease. The number of persons having the exposure or\nreceiving the intervention who have the disease or condition in question is represented by 'a'. The number of persons having the exposure or receiving the intervention who do not have the disease or\ncondition in question is represented by 'b'. The number of persons who do not have the exposure or who do not receive the intervention in question, and who do have the disease or condition, is represented\nby 'c'. The number of persons who do not have the exposure or who do not receive the intervention in question, and who do not have the disease, is represented by 'd'. By this convention, the incidence of\nthose with the exposure is computed by determining the number of patients with the exposure and who developed disease (a) and dividing it by the total number of patients who were exposed (a+ b). The\nincidence of those without the exposure who developed disease is computed by determining the number of patients without the exposure who developed disease (c) and dividing it by the total number of\npatients who were not exposed (c + d). AR is defined as AR= (a/ (a+ b)) - (c/(c + d)). In this scenario, the AR can be determined by (20 /(20 + 1980))-(8 /(8 + 7992)) = 20/2000 - 8/8000 = 0.010--0.001\n= 0.009.",

According to guidelines\nfrom the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 require annual, multidisciplinary screening, including ophthalmic, neurologic, and dermatologic examinations, blood\npressure monitoring, and growth and bone health monitoring. Ophthalmic examination is useful for the early detection and treatment of OPGs, which tend to occur before age 6 years. Treatment includes\nsurgical debulking of tumors, management of seizures and neurologic complications, and genetic counseling.\nIncorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E.\nThe use of routine diagnostic imaging in asymptomatic children with neurofibromatosis type 1, such as with CT scan of the chest and abdomen (Choice A) or MRI of the brain (Choice B) remains\ncontroversial.

Capacity assessments are based on a discussion with the patient in order to assess these four factors of\nunderstanding, appreciation, reasoning, and choice, and can be conducted by any physician. Capacity is not a global assessment but rather pertains to a specific decision, and therefore the assessment\nshould be based on the individual patient, their condition at the lime, and the particular medical decision being made. The assessment must be performed rigorously in settings where the consequences of\nthe decision are particularly serious, as in this case. This patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has a poor long-term prognosis and is facing end-of-life decision making. Some patients may value quality\nof life or comfort rather than prolongation of life, and patients have a right to express these values in their decision making.

Basal cell carcinomas typically present as pink, pearly papules or nodules with rolled borders and central ulceration commonly on sun-exposed areas of\nthe head and neck. Subtypes of basal cell carcinoma include those that are less invasive, such as superficial and nodular, and those that are more invasive, such as infiltrative and morpheaform. In all\nsubtypes, the risk for metastasis is low, although the tumors can invade locally and cause significant tissue damage. Biopsy may be performed with a variety of techniques, including excisional, shave, or punch\nbiopsy. Treatment of basal cell carcinoma requires complete surgical removal, either via excision or Mohs micrographic surgery. In the case of incomplete excision, re-excision with negative biopsy margins is\nindicated to reduce the risk for further local spread.",

A variety of dosing regimens may be used. Available LAI antipsychotics include both first-generation antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, and\natypical antipsychotics, such as aripiprazole, olanzapine, paliperidone, or risperidone. The adverse effect profiles of LAI antipsycholics are typically similar to their oral equivalents.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Nephrolithiasis, or ureterolithiasis, describes the formation of calculi within the urinary collecting system, otherwise known as renal calculi or ureteral stones. The typical presentation of renal calculi that have\nbecome lodged in the ureter (ureterolithiasis) includes severe, intermittent, sharp flank pain with either gross or microscopic hematuria, leukocytosis, and, occasionally, evidence of a concomitant urinary tract\ninfection. Calcium-containing stones are the most common varieties, although renal calculi may also be composed of cystine, struvite, and uric acid. While abdominal plain x-rays were traditionally used for\ndiagnosis, urate stones are radiolucent, and given the availability and sensitivity of advanced imaging, a noncontrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is now the preferred imaging modality for definitive\ndiagnosis. One exception to this is in pediatrics, where imaging modalities that involve less radiation, such as ultrasonography and x-ray, are often used before modalities such as CT. Acute management\ndepends on the size and location of the calculi in addition to complicating factors such as abnormal anatomy or the concurrent presence of a urinary tract infection. Calculi larger than 6 mm often require\nintervention as they are unlikely to pass on their own. For smaller calculi in clinically stable patients, treatment with oral hydration and analgesia is appropriate.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular transmission that has a bimodal age of onset, peaking in both young adults (teens to 20s) and older adults (50s to 60s). Patients with\nmyasthenia gravis possess antibodies that block or destroy nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which interferes with neuromuscular Junction signaling. Many patients with myasthenia gravis have\nthymic hyperplasia or thymoma. In myasthenia gravis, the thymus, which is the site of T-lymphocyte maturation, may show abnormalities in the presentation of the nAChR as an antigen to helper T\nlymphocytes. This abnormal antigen presentation is postulated to result in autoimmune attack of the nAChR on skeletal muscle cells. Patients present with progressively worsening skeletal muscle weakness\nat rest and fatigability on activation in focal or generalized muscle groups. Thus, nerve conduction studies with repetitive stimulation are used to confirm the diagnosis. The ocular, bulbar, and neck muscles\nare commonly affected. Most concerningly, respiratory muscle weakness can lead to respiratory insufficiency, and in an acute flare, these patients may require mechanical ventilation. Management includes\nsymptomatic treatments such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors along with immune modulating therapies. In patients with or without thymoma, complete thymectomy may be curative.",

Laboratory findings include transaminitis, increased alkaline phosphatase, hyperbilirubinemia, and bilirubinuria. Liver biopsy is not routinely required but may show ballooning\nhepatocyte degeneration and Councilman bodies. Outbreaks of HAV are common among men who have sex with men (MSM). The Centers for Disease Control Advisory Committee on Immunization\nPractices (CDC ACIP) recommends routine vaccination against HAV among MSM patients, as well as other high-risk populations, including international travelers to high-risk areas, HIV-positive patients,\npatients experiencing homelessness, and users of injection drugs. The HAV vaccine is an inactivated vaccine and is given via intramuscular injection in a series of two injections.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Adhesions are the most common cause of small bowel obstruction (SBO) in patients with a prior history of intra-abdominal surgery. Obstruction of the small bowel occurs as a result of partial or complete\nblockage of the small bowel lumen from either intraluminal or extraluminal obstruction. It typically presents with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and distention. Partial SBO allows a degree of\ncontinued flatus with diminished stooling, and complete SBO results in obstipation (no passage of stool or flatus). SBO has many potential causes, with formation of peritoneal adhesions following a previous\nintra-abdominal surgery being the most frequent. On physical examination, SBO typically presents with abdominal tenderness, distension, tympany to percussion, and borborygmi (high-pitched, hyperactive\nbowel sounds). Potential complications of SBO include bowel rupture and/or necrosis, which can result in sudden-onset peritoneal abdominal signs, such as rebound tenderness and guarding. Abdominal x\nrays typically show dilated small bowel loops and can also have multiple air-fluid levels. Management requires bowel rest and intravenous hydration followed by surgical intervention if the obstruction does\nnot reduce on its own. Partial SBO may resolve with monitoring, supportive care, and bowel rest, whereas complete obstruction or any complicated partial obstruction generally requires management through\nexploratory laparotomy.",

The recurrent laryngeal nerves run posteriorly to the two lobes bilaterally.

Special care is taken to identify these nerves during thyroidectomy to avoid nerve\ninjury, often with direct intraoperative nerve monitoring. Unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis can lead to voice hoarseness caused by the inability to abduct the vocal cord on one side, whereas\nbilateral paralysis can lead to airway obstruction as both vocal cords remain in a medial position. This patient has respiratory distress with audible stridor, indicating an upper airway obstruction, the likelihood\nof which is further reinforced by decreased breath sounds bilaterally caused by poor air movement through the obstruction.

AMO is common and is a leading cause of nonreversible blindness in developed countries. Early stages of the disease\nmay be asymptomatic or characterized by insidious blurring or metamorphopsia (a visual distortion in which straight lines appear curved). In advanced stages, profound vision loss may result from retinal\ngeographic atrophy or choroidal neovascularization with associated macular edema, exudation, or hemorrhage. Risk factors for AMO include age, smoking, and genetics. The diagnosis is established by a\ndilated funduscopic examination to evaluate the retina. Antioxidant and vitamin supplementation are helpful for delaying the progression of nonexudative (dry) AMO, while exudative (wet) AMO is treated with\nintravitreal inJections of monoclonal antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor.",

An occult hip fracture is likely in the setting of osteopenia or osteoporosis, and advanced imaging, such\nas an MRI of the hip, is the most appropriate next step in management. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation are the first line for treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. Reduction of active\nosteoporotic risk factors should also be pursued. Weight-bearing exercises are recommended to slow deterioration of bone mineral density. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity.

Inadequately treated pain can lead to hypertension and patient dissatisfaction as well as delayed recovery caused by\ndecreased ambulation and increased hospital length of stay. This can be exceptionally challenging in patients taking opioids prior to surgery as they often have an increased tolerance to opioids and require\nlarger doses than the opioid-naive patient. The classic approach to perioperative pain control includes a multimodal technique, including acetaminophen, local anesthetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\ndrugs, and oral and intravenous opioids. Patient-controlled analgesia is a method of providing pain control frequently used in the opioid-tolerant population or for those with significant postoperative pain. It\ninvolves programming a pump to deliver a small bolus dose of parenteral opioid in response to the patient pressing a button with a lockout interval and maximum dose to prevent overdose. This allows the\npatient to control the frequency of analgesic medication rather than be reliant on the nurse for pain medication distribution and improves patient satisfaction. Additionally, it allows the practitioner to calculate\na total opioid requirement that may be utilized to transition the patient to an effective oral regimen. This patient has hypertension likely related to his ongoing significant pain in the setting of previous opioid\nuse, given that his blood pressure improves after pain medication administration. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to improve his hypertension should be aimed at treating his pain.",

Additionally, decreased\nestrogen concentrations may cause failure to develop mature secondary sexual characteristics of breast and pubic hair development. Patients may also develop vaginal atrophy or dryness related to low\nestrogen concentrations, similar to postmenopausal patients. Vital signs will be within normal limits. Diagnosis is made with a karyotype analysis, which would be the most appropriate next step in the\nmanagement of this patient's condition. Other laboratory values that may aid in diagnosis are increased concentrations of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone caused by the lack of negative\nfeedback from estrogen, but these findings are nonspecific.",

A lack of oral intake, such as in cases of total\nparenteral nutrition (TPN), with resultant limited gastric emptying will also cause limited biliary drainage and limited gallbladder contractility. In addition, TPN can cause bile duct inflammation, fibrosis, and\nbiliary obstruction, which describes the clinical picture of cholestasis. TPN-induced cholestasis is more common in patients with a short bowel. Cholestasis is defined by increased indirect and/or direct\nbilirubin caused by the inability to excrete bilirubin.

The disease\nusually presents with an insidious onset of psychiatric (eg, irritability, depression, psychosis) and cognitive symptoms. Motor symptoms (eg, chorea, hypotonia, dystonia, loss of voluntary control of\nmovements) typically appear later in the disease course. People with HD typically die 10 to 40 years after disease onset. Chorea, a key HD symptom, can be initially experienced as restlessness. Chorea is\ndistinguished by irregular, unpredictable muscle movements that tend to flow from one muscle group to another. Treatment is symptomatic and can include tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine, which target\nchorea by depleting dopamine stores. HD is caused by expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (CAG) on chromosome 4, which occurs when a series of three nucleotides in repetition are replicated incorrectly\nand too many repeats are included in the replicated product. HD also demonstrates anticipation, a genetic inheritance phenomenon in which future generations are affected at a younger age or with more\nsevere symptoms.",

Initial evaluation includes a sterile speculum examination of the vagina, which\nmay show pooling of amniotic fluid or leakage of fluid from the cervical os. Nitrazine testing of the fluid will show a pH of 7.0 to 7.3, and terning will be seen on microscopic examination. Ultrasonography can\nalso be utilized to determine the amount of residual amniotic fluid, which would be decreased in the setting of the rupture of membranes. Risk factors include previous premature rupture of membranes, a\nvaginal or cervical infection, and cigarette smoking. Patients with PPROM are at increased risk for preterm delivery, as the rupture of membranes usually precipitates the onset of labor. Thus, these patients\nare treated with betamethasone to accelerate fetal lung maturity. Antibiotics are commonly administered prophylactically as a result of an increased risk for chorioamnionitis.

Acute chest syndrome (ACS)\noccurs as a result of vaso-occlusion within the pulmonary microvasculature and is diagnosed in patients with SCO who present with a new pulmonary infiltrate in the setting of fever or other new respiratory\nsymptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, increased work of breathing, tachypnea, or hypoxemia. ACS is a leading cause of mortality in patients with SCO. While ACS is a distinct clinical syndrome, it\nis commonly precipitated by another illness such as bacterial or viral pneumonia, asthma exacerbation with hypoventilation, or fat emboli. Plain film x-rays typically show segmental or subsegmental\nconsolidation, or a pleural effusion, with predilection for involvement of the lower lobes. It is both impractical and nearly impossible to distinguish ACS from bacterial pneumonia in patients with SCO. In\npatients with SCO who present with fever or ACS, obtaining blood cultures is essential to promptly identify bacteremia. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated immediately after blood cultures are\nobtained and should not be delayed pending further workup. Further treatment involves analgesia, maintaining normoxia with supplemental oxygen or the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation,\njudicious use of fluids, and aggressive pulmonary hygiene measures, including the use of an incentive spirometer.",

II is mediated by activation of lgE, which leads to the release of histamine\nand other cytokines from mast cells and basophils.

Symptoms include the rapid onset of bronchospasm with dyspnea or wheezing, urticaria, flushing, nausea and emesis, edematous lips and tongue, and\nhypotension with tachycardia. When severe and untreated, ii can progress to circulatory collapse with cardiovascular arrest or death caused by asphyxiation and airway obstruction. Treatment includes the\nadministration of epinephrine, antihistamines, bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids, as well as intravenous fluids. Severe cases may require endotracheal intubation and the administration of vasopressors.\nThis patient with a history of peanut allergy consumed a cookie that likely contained traces of peanuts, leading to an anaphylactic reaction with her symptoms of dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, urticaria,\nand wheezing.

Complications of diverticular disease include lower gastrointestinal bleeding and diverticulitis.

Disc herniation occurs most often following chronic disc degeneration combined with a minor traumatic event such as\nbending and lifting a heavy object causing an acute increase in the intradiscal pressure. Disc herniation typically presents as acute back pain along with symptoms of lumbosacral radiculopathy, including\nacute extremity pain and/or weakness in a dermalomal and myotomic distribution with respect to the impinged spinal nerve. Piriformis syndrome presents similarly but with pain reproduced with palpation of\nthe piriformis on the affected side. Regardless of cause, sciatica is diagnosed clinically, through a combination of history and examination maneuvers, including straight-leg raise testing, in which flexion of\nthe hip while the leg is held in extension at the knee reproduces pain in the lower back that generally shoots down the leg. Lumbar imaging with MRI or CT scan is useful for patients with severe motor or\nsensory dysfunction but is not required for most patients with mild or moderate symptoms without an objective neurologic deficit and in whom there is no concern for spinal cord impingement. Trial of\ntherapy is generally appropriate before imaging in such cases. Patients with evidence of muscular weakness may benefit from nerve conduction studies or electromyography. Most patients with sciatica\ndemonstrate spontaneous improvement with conservative management, including analgesia, physical therapy, and activity as tolerated. Prolonged bed rest is not necessary for most patients and may\nworsen pain and prolong recovery.",

It may also occur in isolation and via nonspecific, random mutations and\nindividual point mutations that are de nova. VSOs are characterized by a holosystolic murmur best heard in the lower left sternal border and may have an associated palpable thrill. VSDs result in a left-to\nright shunt, which increases pulmonary blood flow. They are acyanotic lesions. If uncorrected, the increased pulmonary blood flow may result in pulmonary artery remodeling and consequent pulmonary\narterial hypertension, which may cause a reversal of the shunt from right to left.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The rotator cuff is the group of muscles and tendons that act to seat the humeral head directly into the center of the glenoid during motion of the shoulder. These muscles also act in concert with other\nmuscles in the shoulder to internally and externally rotate, abduct, and adduct the shoulder. These muscles include the subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. The prime movements of\nthese muscles at the glenohumeral joint include internal rotation (subscapularis), external rotation (teres minor and infraspinatus), and abduction (supraspinatus). The coupling and antagonistic action of\nthese muscles seats the humeral head in the glenoid and provides a stable pivot upon which the larger, more powerful muscles of the shoulder can act, such as the latissimus dorsi, deltoid, and pectoralis\nmajor. A rotator cuff tear typically occurs at the insertion of the tendons of the rotator cuff on the humeral head. Commonly, this occurs in the supraspinatus tendon; however, tears can occur in any of the\nrotator cuff tendons or at the myotendinous Junction. Risk factors for rotator cuff tears include heavy labor, repetitive overhead lifting, diabetes mellitus, and vascular disease. Chronic disease leading to\ntendon degeneration as well as acute or repetitive microtrauma are thought to contribute to eventual tendon failure. The classic presentation of a rotator cuff tear is with pain and weakness in one of the axes\nof motion corresponding with the associated rotator cuff muscle. Late manifestations of a tear include clinically appreciable atrophy of the corresponding muscle. MRI is typically indicated for patients with\nrotator cuff injury to delineate the extent of injury and to determine the need for or to plan for surgical intervention.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Excess free water consumption over a rapid period can lead to acute hyponatremia, which, if severe, may include neurologic manifestations including altered mental status, seizures, central nervous\nsystem herniation syndromes, coma, and death. Acute consumption of free water results in dilution of renal interstitial concentration gradients and limits concentrating ability. Resulting serum and urine\nabnormalities include hyponatremia, low serum osmolality, and low urine osmolality. Hyponatremia, if mild, does not generally cause symptoms or objective examination findings. Treatment of hyponatremia\ninvolves treatment of any underlying disease and gradual sodium correction, typically with fluid restriction in cases of psychogenic polydipsia or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. A safe rate\nof sodium correction is generally no more than 6 to 12 mEq/day. When hyponatremia is corrected too rapidly, extracellular sodium exerts osmotic pressure that leads to the rapid efflux of water from\nneurons, which can lead to demyelination. The pons is particularly vulnerable to demyelinating injury, and the rapid correction of hyponatremia can result in central pontine myelinolysis. In cases of acute,\nsevere hyponatremia with neurologic symptoms of consequence (eg, seizure, coma, herniation, altered mental status), correction with hypertonic saline is appropriate.",

CT angiography of the chest\ncan differentiate types of blunt aortic injury, including aortic dissection, aortic rupture, or pseudoaneurysm. Repair of traumatic dissection of the aorta can be performed via open repair or endovascular repair.\nSuch patients are often critically ill and hemodynamically unstable.

Treatment with opioids typically employs mu opioid receptor agonists, such as morphine, oxycodone,\nhydromorphone, fentanyl, or methadone. Dose titration is often necessary after beginning initial therapy. Oral opioids are typically administered on a fixed, scheduled dose. Breakthrough or progressive pain\ncan be treated by increasing the scheduled dose, usually by at least 25%. The percentage increase in dosage is informed by the severity of pain and assessment of other comorbidities and risk factors for\noverdose. Patients with uncontrolled pain on high oral doses of opioids may benefit from transdermal patches or intravenous administration.",

BPH presents with urinary dribbling and incontinence, difficulty starting or maintaining a urinary stream, nocturia, the need to frequently urinate, and incomplete voiding. These symptoms are\ntypically insidious in onset, chronic, and progressive. Urethral or bladder outlet obstruction may lead to acute symptoms of pelvic pain along with an inability to void, and may predispose to cystitis,\nhydronephrosis, or pyelonephritis. The diagnosis of BPH is made by history, physical examination, and urodynamic testing, along with ruling out alternate diagnoses (eg, prostatic malignancy). Treatment\nincludes supportive care, a-blockers (eg, tamsulosin), 5-a-reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride), or surgery. Acute obstruction can be managed with catheterization in order to decompress the urinary bladder\nand prevent acute complications of prolonged bladder outlet obstruction, such as bladder rupture, urothelial cell atrophy or necrosis, hydroureter, hydronephrosis, postrenal azotemia, and/or end-stage\nkidney disease.",

Reduviidae insects are nocturnal and feed on sleeping human hosts. They are common in rural areas and\ninfest thatched roofs, cracks, or holes in poorly built housing. South American trypanosomiasis manifests with an early, acute stage characterized by mild, nonspecific symptoms of fever, malaise, and\nlymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, which can last for 1 to 2 months and resolve spontaneously. There may be mild swelling and erythema at the site of the bite, commonly on the eyelids or near the mouth.\nSouth American trypanosomiasis is typically curable if treatment is initiated promptly during the acute stage. If not detected or treated during the acute stage, chronic infection typically ensues, which is not\ncurable. Chronic South American trypanosomiasis is characterized by cardiac manifestations, including dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure, along with gastrointestinal\nmanifestations, such as constipation or megaesophagus, which can produce dysphagia, odynophagia, and weight loss. The diagnosis is confirmed with a variety of tests depending on the chronicity of\ninfection and may include peripheral blood smear to detect extracellular parasites, polymerase chain reaction test, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treatment involves prolonged courses of\nantiparasitic drugs, such as nifurtimox or benznidazole. Treatment of the chronic phase is supportive and oriented toward management of cardiac and gastrointestinal complications.",

Visible lesions in the oropharynx increase the likelihood of distal gastrointestinal lesions. Patients should be evaluated\nwith esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGO) to assess for visceral injury.

Symptoms include hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal\natrophy or dryness. Mood and sleeping patterns may be affected. While ii is commonly a clinical diagnosis, laboratory studies will show increased follicle-stimulating hormone and decreased estradiol\nconcentrations. As symptoms of menopause are secondary to estrogen deficiency, which can also increase the risk for a variety of other health problems (eg, osteoporosis), hormone therapy with\nsupplemental estrogen is often considered. While estrogen therapy does relieve symptoms, ii is not without risk. Prolonged exposure to unopposed estrogen can increase the risk for endometrial cancer,\ncardiovascular disease, thromboembolism, and breast cancer. The recommended duration of use is limited to 3 to 5 years for these reasons.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends routine colorectal cancer screening for all patients beginning at age 45 years and continuing until age 75 years. Colorectal cancer is common,\nand early detection and treatment have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality. Colonoscopy remains the gold standard screening test as it allows direct visualization and excision of polyps\nthroughout the length of the colon. Other direct visualization tests such as flexible sigmoidoscopy may be acceptable for some patients. Other testing strategies include stool-based tests, such as fecal occult\nblood and fecal immunochemical (FIT) tests, and CT colonography. A variety of screening intervals are acceptable and recommended by national governing bodies, with many patients undergoing either\ncolonoscopy every 10 years, annual FIT screening, screening every 10 years with flexible sigmoidoscopy and FIT, or screening every 5 years with CT colonography. In the event that adenomatous polyps or\nearly stage colon cancer is identified, closer follow up may be necessary. Careful risk stratification should be performed based on colonoscopy results to determine an appropriate follow-up interval. This\npatient's colonoscopy shows a polyp with dysplasia, which places him at increased risk for colon cancer. Colonoscopy should be repeated in 3 years for patients with 5 to 10 tubular adenomas or sessile\npolyps less than 10 mm in diameter, one tubular adenoma or sessile polyp greater than 10 mm in diameter, multiple serrated sessile polyps, or adenomas or sessile polyps with dysplasia or with villous or\ntubulovillous histology that are completely removed.",

Renal artery stenosis in children may be an isolated finding, or it may be associated with fibromuscular dysplasia or neurofibromatosis type1. Treatment\noptions for secondary hypertension associated with renal artery stenosis in children include calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or angioplasty. CCBs are generally preferable to other agents, such as thiazide\ndiuretics or angiotensin receptor blockers, both of which can result in reduced glomerular filtration and a greater risk for hyperkalemia.

In a patient with a cardiovascular risk of less than 5%, the risks of a statin medication often outweigh the benefits. In contrast, if a patient's cardiovascular\nrisk is greater than 10%, starting a statin medication is indicated.

Pericarditis classically presents with substernal chest pain, which is often pleuritic,\nworsens when lying down, and improves with leaning forward. II can occur in patients with inflammatory, infectious, or malignant conditions, such as viral infection, systemic lupus erythematosus,\ntuberculosis, or lymphoma, and can present as a complication of myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery. On examination, pericarditis is disclosed by a diastolic friction rub, described as a harsh sound\nheard in diastole. The condition is diagnosed clinically and supported by increased inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. ECG is characterized by diffuse ST\nsegment elevation and PR segment depression. If not treated, pericarditis can lead to the development of pericardia! effusions, which, if large and quickly accumulating, can result in cardiac tamponade.\nEchocardiography should be performed to assess for the presence of a pericardia! effusion, which may require pericardiocentesis for drainage, if large. Overall cardiac function (eg, ejection fraction) should\nalso be assessed if cardiac enzyme biomarkers are increased and if there is concern for concomitant myocarditis or heart failure. Treatment includes anti-inflammatory medications, such as indomethacin,\nglucocorticoids, and/or colchicine. Conditions with a similar presentation should also be ruled out, such as acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and aortic dissection.",

It occurs as\na result of the accumulation of serum ketones such as r..-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone in the setting of insulin deficiency. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis\noccurs as a result of the relative state of starvation created by absent insulin signaling. Vital signs may show tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension caused by severe dehydration. Laboratory studies\ntypically show metabolic acidosis, increased serum glucose, ketones, and catecholamines, and a high anion gap caused by the accumulation of unmeasured anions in the serum. Metabolic acidosis is\naccompanied by a decreased bicarbonate concentration in the serum, as bicarbonate is consumed in the neutralization of increased acidic molecules (hydrogen molecules) in the blood. Serum glucagon\nand catecholamine concentrations are typically increased, as both are lipogenic, thereby liberating lipids for metabolism to ketones and increasing response to acute physiologic stress. Treatment includes\nreplacement of insulin, volume repletion, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions.",

In the setting of trauma, hyphema occurs as a consequence of damage to the AC angle, iris root, or ciliary body, which are richly vascularized. Immediate and subacute complications of\nhyphema include ocular hypertension, which may lead to glaucomatous optic nerve damage, rebleeding, and corneal blood staining. Corneal blood staining may significantly impair visual acuity and may\nnecessitate corneal transplantation if the central cornea is involved. Chronic complications of hyphema are primarily related to glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve. Hyphema is particularly dangerous in\npatients with sickle cell disease or trait because of the complications of red blood cell (RSC) sickling. Sickled RBCs in the AC are less likely to be filtered through the trabecular meshwork and are likely to\nresult in ocular hypertension. Ocular hypertension may then induce sickling of RBCs in retinal vasculature, leading to irreversible vision loss through induction of retinal arterial or venous occlusions. Most\nhyphemas may be managed medically through topical drops to lower ocular pressure. In patients with sickle cell disease or trait, surgical AC washout is indicated if intraocular pressure is not controlled\nwithin 24 hours.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH), along with calcitriol (1,25-hydroxyvitamin-D), regulates\ncalcium homeostasis. PTH is secreted in response to low serum calcium concentrations and acts to raise the concentration by increasing bone resorption, promoting production of calcitriol to increase\nintestinal absorption of calcium, and increasing calcium resorption in the renal tubules. Patients with hypoparathyroidism will have an increase in urinary 24-hour calcium excretion as a result of the loss of\nresorption stimulation in the kidneys, requiring daily calcium supplementation. Symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral paresthesia, carpopedal spasm, laryngospasm, and prolonged QT interval. The\nChvostek sign, in which tapping of the facial nerve leads to spasm of the facial muscles, and Trousseau phenomenon, in which an inflated blood pressure cuff occluding the brachia! artery causes carpopedal\nspasm, are two physical examination findings that may indicate hypocalcemia.",

In primary disease, patients present\nwith subacute fevers, weight loss, night sweats, cough, and malaise. latent tuberculosis can occur as the organism proliferates within macrophages and is maintained within caseating granulomas. PPD skin\ntesting stimulates a T-cell driven type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction against subdermally injected tuberculin antigen. A common cause of false positive PPD testing includes prior vaccination with BCG\nvaccine. Per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, induration exceeding 15 mm is considered a positive result for a PPD skin test in patients with no risk factors for tuberculosis. lnduration\nexceeding 10 mm is considered a positive test result for high-risk patients, such as recent immigrants from countries where tuberculosis is common, intravenous drug users, residents of and workers in high\nrisk congregate settings (such as prisons, homeless shelters, or nursing care facilities), or those with particular medical conditions, such as silicosis, diabetes mellitus, or chronic renal failure, among others.\nlnduration greater than 5 mm is considered positive in patients with HIV, with recent contact with a tuberculosis-positive patient, or with organ transplantation or immunosuppression. This patient's test result\nis negative for her demographic, and she should be provided clearance to begin volunteer work.",

In severe cases, mediastinal structures may be stretched or compressed, compromising\nvenous return, resulting in obstructive shock (known as a tension pneumothorax). On physical examination, a pneumothorax presents as unilateral diminished breath sounds with hyperresonance to\npercussion. Pneumothorax can appear on chest x-ray as radiolucent air and the absence of interstitial lung markings in the pleural space adjacent to the lung parenchyma. If a pneumothorax is large, tube\nthoracostomy should be performed to evacuate the air in the pleural space to aid in lung re-expansion. Once a chest tube is placed and healing of the inciting injury occurs, leakage of air into the pleural\nspace should stop. If a persistent air leak is noted, the source of the leak should be investigated. A ruptured bronchus requires extended time to heal and is a potential source of air leak. If the leak persists,\nsurgical correction of the rupture may be required to prevent chronic pneumothorax from a resultant bronchopleural fistula.",

Platelets appear normal on peripheral blood smear. Coagulation studies are also normal, although bleeding lime is prolonged. ITP often occurs following an\ninfection, frequently with Helicobacter pylori, Epstein-Barr virus, or HIV, and is generally self-limited.

Premature delivery in early pregnancy results in stillbirth caused by incomplete development of the\nneonatal lungs and brain, which do not complete their maturation until the end of the second trimester. The diagnosis of death in newborns requires a careful examination, which may be complicated by the\nfact that many reflexes are not fully developed, and ocular examination (as well as examination of corneal, vestibular, and oculocephalic reflexes) may be impossible. Apnea testing is a reliable method for\ndiagnosing death and involves providing adequate oxygenation via ventilator, followed by observation of a rise in carbon dioxide levels caused by lack of spontaneous respirations as the ventilator is\nweaned. EEG is not usually necessary, but, if performed, demonstrates electrocerebral silence, or lack of electrical waveforms. In the setting of death in a nonviable, premature newborn, it is appropriate to\ndiscontinue resuscitative efforts. Generally, any fetus of less than gestational age 22 to 23 weeks (depending on the particular center caring for the child) will be nonviable, and resuscitation efforts would be\ninappropriate.",

Respiratory depression can\ncause hypercarbia, which can lead to altered mental status, coma, and seizures. Opioid overdose can also lead to respiratory arrest and death. Given this patient's respiratory rate of 6 breaths per minute,\nhydromorphone overdose leading to hypoventilation and hypercarbia is the most likely cause of her change in level of consciousness.

First-line\ntreatment of OA includes acetaminophen.

When the power of a study is increased, the incidence of a type II error\ndecreases. A type II error occurs when a study demonstrates no difference between the null and alternative hypotheses, when in fact, a difference exists. The type II error rate is calculated by subtracting\nthe power from 100%. A meta-analysis is a form of study in which statistical analysis is performed lo combine the results of multiple studies addressing the same question. Meta-analysis is useful for\novercoming limitations of the constituent studies within the meta-analysis. By pooling the results of multiple studies, meta-analyses reduce the risk for type II error caused by the smaller sample sizes within\neach constituent randomized controlled trial.

It allows the practitioner to assess the patient's current health status, intervene to prevent complications, and educate the patient. During the visit,\nthe obstetrician can complete a comprehensive history and physical examination, as well as order appropriate laboratory testing and imaging. This visit should specifically include an assessment of\nimmunization status, substance use, medical problems, family history of heritable diseases, height, weight, and baseline vital signs, such as blood pressure. Recommendations for weight gain during\npregnancy, which can be established at this initial prenatal visit, are based on a patient's prepregnancy BMI. Those who are underweight are recommended to gain 28 to 40 pounds, while those with obesity\nare recommended to gain 11 to 20 pounds. This is because patients who are underweight are at increased risk for having newborns who are small for gestational age, whereas patients with obesity are at\nincreased risk for having newborns who are large for gestational age. Additional weight gain in patients with baseline obesity can also increase the risk for gestational hypertension and preeclampsia,\ngestational diabetes, and cesarean delivery. Thus, the most appropriate recommendation for this patient is to limit pregnancy weight gain to the recommended 11 to 20 pounds to prevent pregnancy\ncomplications. This is additionally important given her history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, which increases her risk for diabetes.",

According to guidelines\nfrom the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 require annual, multidisciplinary screening, including ophthalmic, neurologic, and dermatologic examinations, blood\npressure monitoring, and growth and bone health monitoring. Ophthalmic examination is useful for the early detection and treatment of OPGs, which tend to occur before age 6 years. Treatment includes\nsurgical debulking of tumors, management of seizures and neurologic complications, and genetic counseling.\nIncorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E.\nThe use of routine diagnostic imaging in asymptomatic children with neurofibromatosis type 1, such as with CT scan of the chest and abdomen (Choice A) or MRI of the brain (Choice B) remains\ncontroversial. According to the most recent AAP 2019 guidelines, diagnostic imaging studies should be performed as needed.

Capacity is not a global assessment but rather pertains to a specific decision, and therefore the assessment\nshould be based on the individual patient, their condition at the lime, and the particular medical decision being made. The assessment must be performed rigorously in settings where the consequences of\nthe decision are particularly serious, as in this case. This patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has a poor long-term prognosis and is facing end-of-life decision making. Some patients may value quality\nof life or comfort rather than prolongation of life, and patients have a right to express these values in their decision making. This patient is alert and appears to have decisional capacity. A further assessment\nof her capacity should be conducted to explore her reasoning and to exclude other factors, such as depression, that may limit her capacity.",

The primary risk factor for developing basal cell carcinoma is ultraviolet light exposure, though\nage, fair skin, and family history are also contributory. Basal cell carcinomas typically present as pink, pearly papules or nodules with rolled borders and central ulceration commonly on sun-exposed areas of\nthe head and neck. Subtypes of basal cell carcinoma include those that are less invasive, such as superficial and nodular, and those that are more invasive, such as infiltrative and morpheaform. In all\nsubtypes, the risk for metastasis is low, although the tumors can invade locally and cause significant tissue damage. Biopsy may be performed with a variety of techniques, including excisional, shave, or punch\nbiopsy. Treatment of basal cell carcinoma requires complete surgical removal, either via excision or Mohs micrographic surgery. In the case of incomplete excision, re-excision with negative biopsy margins is\nindicated to reduce the risk for further local spread.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Nephrolithiasis, or ureterolithiasis, describes the formation of calculi within the urinary collecting system, otherwise known as renal calculi or ureteral stones. The typical presentation of renal calculi that have\nbecome lodged in the ureter (ureterolithiasis) includes severe, intermittent, sharp flank pain with either gross or microscopic hematuria, leukocytosis, and, occasionally, evidence of a concomitant urinary tract\ninfection. Calcium-containing stones are the most common varieties, although renal calculi may also be composed of cystine, struvite, and uric acid. While abdominal plain x-rays were traditionally used for\ndiagnosis, urate stones are radiolucent, and given the availability and sensitivity of advanced imaging, a noncontrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is now the preferred imaging modality for definitive\ndiagnosis. One exception to this is in pediatrics, where imaging modalities that involve less radiation, such as ultrasonography and x-ray, are often used before modalities such as CT. Acute management\ndepends on the size and location of the calculi in addition to complicating factors such as abnormal anatomy or the concurrent presence of a urinary tract infection. Calculi larger than 6 mm often require\nintervention as they are unlikely to pass on their own. For smaller calculi in clinically stable patients, treatment with oral hydration and analgesia is appropriate.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular transmission that has a bimodal age of onset, peaking in both young adults (teens to 20s) and older adults (50s to 60s). Patients with\nmyasthenia gravis possess antibodies that block or destroy nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which interferes with neuromuscular Junction signaling. Many patients with myasthenia gravis have\nthymic hyperplasia or thymoma. In myasthenia gravis, the thymus, which is the site of T-lymphocyte maturation, may show abnormalities in the presentation of the nAChR as an antigen to helper T\nlymphocytes. This abnormal antigen presentation is postulated to result in autoimmune attack of the nAChR on skeletal muscle cells. Patients present with progressively worsening skeletal muscle weakness\nat rest and fatigability on activation in focal or generalized muscle groups. Thus, nerve conduction studies with repetitive stimulation are used to confirm the diagnosis. The ocular, bulbar, and neck muscles\nare commonly affected. Most concerningly, respiratory muscle weakness can lead to respiratory insufficiency, and in an acute flare, these patients may require mechanical ventilation. Management includes\nsymptomatic treatments such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors along with immune modulating therapies. In patients with or without thymoma, complete thymectomy may be curative.",

II is a common, yet preventable cause of liver disease. It is commonly acquired through\nthe ingestion of poorly cooked, improperly handled, or raw foods. Presenting signs and symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, abdominal pain, Jaundice, and hepatomegaly, although many\npatients are asymptomatic. Laboratory findings include transaminitis, increased alkaline phosphatase, hyperbilirubinemia, and bilirubinuria. Liver biopsy is not routinely required but may show ballooning\nhepatocyte degeneration and Councilman bodies. Outbreaks of HAV are common among men who have sex with men (MSM). The Centers for Disease Control Advisory Committee on Immunization\nPractices (CDC ACIP) recommends routine vaccination against HAV among MSM patients, as well as other high-risk populations, including international travelers to high-risk areas, HIV-positive patients,\npatients experiencing homelessness, and users of injection drugs. The HAV vaccine is an inactivated vaccine and is given via intramuscular injection in a series of two injections.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Adhesions are the most common cause of small bowel obstruction (SBO) in patients with a prior history of intra-abdominal surgery. Obstruction of the small bowel occurs as a result of partial or complete\nblockage of the small bowel lumen from either intraluminal or extraluminal obstruction. It typically presents with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and distention. Partial SBO allows a degree of\ncontinued flatus with diminished stooling, and complete SBO results in obstipation (no passage of stool or flatus). SBO has many potential causes, with formation of peritoneal adhesions following a previous\nintra-abdominal surgery being the most frequent. On physical examination, SBO typically presents with abdominal tenderness, distension, tympany to percussion, and borborygmi (high-pitched, hyperactive\nbowel sounds). Potential complications of SBO include bowel rupture and/or necrosis, which can result in sudden-onset peritoneal abdominal signs, such as rebound tenderness and guarding. Abdominal x\nrays typically show dilated small bowel loops and can also have multiple air-fluid levels. Management requires bowel rest and intravenous hydration followed by surgical intervention if the obstruction does\nnot reduce on its own. Partial SBO may resolve with monitoring, supportive care, and bowel rest, whereas complete obstruction or any complicated partial obstruction generally requires management through\nexploratory laparotomy.",

The thyroid gland is situated anterior to the trachea and consists of two lobes\nthat are connected by a smaller isthmus. The thyroid is located near a variety of vascular and neurologic structures. The recurrent laryngeal nerves run posteriorly to the two lobes bilaterally. They provide\nmuscle innervation for both abduction and adduction of the vocal cords, as well as sensation to the region below the glottis. Special care is taken to identify these nerves during thyroidectomy to avoid nerve\ninjury, often with direct intraoperative nerve monitoring. Unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis can lead to voice hoarseness caused by the inability to abduct the vocal cord on one side, whereas\nbilateral paralysis can lead to airway obstruction as both vocal cords remain in a medial position. This patient has respiratory distress with audible stridor, indicating an upper airway obstruction, the likelihood\nof which is further reinforced by decreased breath sounds bilaterally caused by poor air movement through the obstruction. Given the onset of this patient's symptoms immediately after surgery, the most\nlikely cause of this presentation is bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis leading to vocal cord paralysis and airway obstruction.",

The most common risk factors are age, smoking, chronic inflammatory disease, corticosteroid use,\nand estrogen-depleting conditions in women. Such demineralization and low bone density is often asymptomatic but increases the risk for fractures, most commonly involving the hip, vertebrae, and distal\nradius. In this patient, diffuse osteopenia can limit the appearance and detection of fractures on x-rays. An occult hip fracture is likely in the setting of osteopenia or osteoporosis, and advanced imaging, such\nas an MRI of the hip, is the most appropriate next step in management. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation are the first line for treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. Reduction of active\nosteoporotic risk factors should also be pursued. Weight-bearing exercises are recommended to slow deterioration of bone mineral density. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity. They are utilized once\nan individual is diagnosed with osteoporosis to reduce further loss of bone mineral density.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Postoperative pain control is a vital component of caring for the surgical patient. Inadequately treated pain can lead to hypertension and patient dissatisfaction as well as delayed recovery caused by\ndecreased ambulation and increased hospital length of stay. This can be exceptionally challenging in patients taking opioids prior to surgery as they often have an increased tolerance to opioids and require\nlarger doses than the opioid-naive patient. The classic approach to perioperative pain control includes a multimodal technique, including acetaminophen, local anesthetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\ndrugs, and oral and intravenous opioids. Patient-controlled analgesia is a method of providing pain control frequently used in the opioid-tolerant population or for those with significant postoperative pain. It\ninvolves programming a pump to deliver a small bolus dose of parenteral opioid in response to the patient pressing a button with a lockout interval and maximum dose to prevent overdose. This allows the\npatient to control the frequency of analgesic medication rather than be reliant on the nurse for pain medication distribution and improves patient satisfaction. Additionally, it allows the practitioner to calculate\na total opioid requirement that may be utilized to transition the patient to an effective oral regimen. This patient has hypertension likely related to his ongoing significant pain in the setting of previous opioid\nuse, given that his blood pressure improves after pain medication administration. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to improve his hypertension should be aimed at treating his pain.",

A lack of oral intake, such as in cases of total\nparenteral nutrition (TPN), with resultant limited gastric emptying will also cause limited biliary drainage and limited gallbladder contractility. In addition, TPN can cause bile duct inflammation, fibrosis, and\nbiliary obstruction, which describes the clinical picture of cholestasis. TPN-induced cholestasis is more common in patients with a short bowel. Cholestasis is defined by increased indirect and/or direct\nbilirubin caused by the inability to excrete bilirubin.

If untreated, preeclampsia\ncan progress to eclampsia, characterized by maternal seizures, which can have profoundly adverse outcomes. Additionally, preeclampsia increases the risk for abruptio placentae, or premature separation of\nthe placenta from the uterus, which can lead to fetal exsanguination. Abruptio placentae most commonly presents with vaginal bleeding, severe uterine pain, and tetanic contractions.

The disease\nusually presents with an insidious onset of psychiatric (eg, irritability, depression, psychosis) and cognitive symptoms. Motor symptoms (eg, chorea, hypotonia, dystonia, loss of voluntary control of\nmovements) typically appear later in the disease course. People with HD typically die 10 to 40 years after disease onset. Chorea, a key HD symptom, can be initially experienced as restlessness. Chorea is\ndistinguished by irregular, unpredictable muscle movements that tend to flow from one muscle group to another. Treatment is symptomatic and can include tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine, which target\nchorea by depleting dopamine stores. HD is caused by expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (CAG) on chromosome 4, which occurs when a series of three nucleotides in repetition are replicated incorrectly\nand too many repeats are included in the replicated product. HD also demonstrates anticipation, a genetic inheritance phenomenon in which future generations are affected at a younger age or with more\nsevere symptoms.",

He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. He is 183 cm (6 ft) tall and weighs 134 kg\n(295 lb); BMI is 40 kg/m?. On admission, his temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 170/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an\noxygen saturation of 60%. On admission, an AP portable x-ray shows bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrates without consolidation. He does not respond to high-flow oxygen therapy. He is intubated and\nmechanically ventilated. Examination shows hyperresonance to percussion and wheezes bilaterally. Ceftriaxone and levofloxacin are administered, and his symptoms improve. On hospital day 4, he is\nextubated. His temperature is 37 .6°C (99.7F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 150/96 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry while sitting shows an oxygen saturation greater than\n95%. Six hours later, the patient's oxygen saturation is 86%. The patient is lying in bed and says he feels fine. Physical examination shows no wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi. There is no peripheral\nedema. A repeat chest x-ray shows improvement.

Immediately following exposure, the area should be copiously washed with soap and water. Baseline and\nserial serologic testing for HIV should be performed at the time of exposure and up to 6 months following exposure. If unknown, the patient's HIV status should be determined immediately. Post-exposure\nprophylaxis should be instituted as soon as possible following a known or possible exposure to HIV. A variety of regimens are frequently employed, commonly a multidrug antiretroviral regimen including two\nnucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as tenofovir or emtricitabine, and an integrase inhibitor, such as dolutegravir or raltegravir.

Initial evaluation includes a sterile speculum examination of the vagina, which\nmay show pooling of amniotic fluid or leakage of fluid from the cervical os. Nitrazine testing of the fluid will show a pH of 7.0 to 7.3, and terning will be seen on microscopic examination. Ultrasonography can\nalso be utilized to determine the amount of residual amniotic fluid, which would be decreased in the setting of the rupture of membranes. Risk factors include previous premature rupture of membranes, a\nvaginal or cervical infection, and cigarette smoking. Patients with PPROM are at increased risk for preterm delivery, as the rupture of membranes usually precipitates the onset of labor. Thus, these patients\nare treated with betamethasone to accelerate fetal lung maturity. Antibiotics are commonly administered prophylactically as a result of an increased risk for chorioamnionitis.

Acute chest syndrome (ACS)\noccurs as a result of vaso-occlusion within the pulmonary microvasculature and is diagnosed in patients with SCO who present with a new pulmonary infiltrate in the setting of fever or other new respiratory\nsymptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, increased work of breathing, tachypnea, or hypoxemia. ACS is a leading cause of mortality in patients with SCO. While ACS is a distinct clinical syndrome, it\nis commonly precipitated by another illness such as bacterial or viral pneumonia, asthma exacerbation with hypoventilation, or fat emboli. Plain film x-rays typically show segmental or subsegmental\nconsolidation, or a pleural effusion, with predilection for involvement of the lower lobes. It is both impractical and nearly impossible to distinguish ACS from bacterial pneumonia in patients with SCO. In\npatients with SCO who present with fever or ACS, obtaining blood cultures is essential to promptly identify bacteremia. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated immediately after blood cultures are\nobtained and should not be delayed pending further workup. Further treatment involves analgesia, maintaining normoxia with supplemental oxygen or the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation,\njudicious use of fluids, and aggressive pulmonary hygiene measures, including the use of an incentive spirometer.",

Amoebic cysts mature to trophozoites in the large bowel, which may invade the colonic mucosa and interstitium, leading to symptoms of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea,\nor may enter the bloodstream and cause hepatic amoebic abscesses, which present with fever and right upper quadrant pain. The diagnosis can be made by identifying cysts on stool microscopy or\nperipheral blood smear, which may show trophozoites with endosomes containing red blood cells, as well as by antibody assay or polymerase chain reaction. Colonoscopy shows mucosal ulcers that are\noften flask-shaped. Treatment of hepatic amoebic abscesses involves combination therapy with metronidazole or tinidazole as well as an antiluminal agent such as paromomycin or iodoquinol. In this\notherwise stable patient with a confirmed diagnosis, it is most appropriate to discontinue broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin.",

II is mediated by activation of lgE, which leads to the release of histamine\nand other cytokines from mast cells and basophils.

Symptoms include the rapid onset of bronchospasm with dyspnea or wheezing, urticaria, flushing, nausea and emesis, edematous lips and tongue, and\nhypotension with tachycardia. When severe and untreated, ii can progress to circulatory collapse with cardiovascular arrest or death caused by asphyxiation and airway obstruction. Treatment includes the\nadministration of epinephrine, antihistamines, bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids, as well as intravenous fluids. Severe cases may require endotracheal intubation and the administration of vasopressors.\nThis patient with a history of peanut allergy consumed a cookie that likely contained traces of peanuts, leading to an anaphylactic reaction with her symptoms of dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, urticaria,\nand wheezing.

Risk factors for the development of diverticulosis include abnormal colonic motility, constipation, high dietary intake of red meat and low dietary fiber,\nphysical inactivity, and obesity. Complications of diverticular disease include lower gastrointestinal bleeding and diverticulitis. Rarely, diverticular disease can lead to the development of a colovesical fistula in\nwhich there is a connection between the rectum and the urinary bladder. This can lead to pneumaturia and passage of fecal material during urination, as well as the development of urinary tract infections,\nseen in this patient with mixed flora and numerous leukocytes on urinalysis.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Lumbar disc herniation and piriformis syndrome are both common causes of sciatica. Disc herniation occurs most often following chronic disc degeneration combined with a minor traumatic event such as\nbending and lifting a heavy object causing an acute increase in the intradiscal pressure. Disc herniation typically presents as acute back pain along with symptoms of lumbosacral radiculopathy, including\nacute extremity pain and/or weakness in a dermalomal and myotomic distribution with respect to the impinged spinal nerve. Piriformis syndrome presents similarly but with pain reproduced with palpation of\nthe piriformis on the affected side. Regardless of cause, sciatica is diagnosed clinically, through a combination of history and examination maneuvers, including straight-leg raise testing, in which flexion of\nthe hip while the leg is held in extension at the knee reproduces pain in the lower back that generally shoots down the leg. Lumbar imaging with MRI or CT scan is useful for patients with severe motor or\nsensory dysfunction but is not required for most patients with mild or moderate symptoms without an objective neurologic deficit and in whom there is no concern for spinal cord impingement. Trial of\ntherapy is generally appropriate before imaging in such cases. Patients with evidence of muscular weakness may benefit from nerve conduction studies or electromyography. Most patients with sciatica\ndemonstrate spontaneous improvement with conservative management, including analgesia, physical therapy, and activity as tolerated. Prolonged bed rest is not necessary for most patients and may\nworsen pain and prolong recovery.",

It is chronic and progressive, often leading to significant morbidity.\nSymptoms include the gradual onset of symmetric arthralgia and joint swelling, as well as morning stiffness, commonly in the fingers and wrists. Chronic disease can progress to affect proximal joints and\nthe cervical spine and leads to significant Joint damage and deformities. Severe disease can cause systemic disease, such as interstitial lung disease, vasculitis, pleuritis, pericarditis, anemia, and\nsubcutaneous nodules. Atlantoaxial involvement is common in chronic disease and may be associated with subluxation with consequent spinal cord injury or radiculopathy. Evaluation of the cervical spine\nwith flexion and extension x-rays in patients with chronic RA is appropriate prior to general anesthesia, to evaluate for atlantoaxial instability and inform the technique for intubation. Direct laryngoscopy,\noften used to intubate patients for general anesthesia, involves significant neck extension and flexion, which could lead to catastrophic neurologic damage in the setting of atlantoaxial instability.

It may also occur in isolation and via nonspecific, random mutations and\nindividual point mutations that are de nova. VSOs are characterized by a holosystolic murmur best heard in the lower left sternal border and may have an associated palpable thrill. VSDs result in a left-to\nright shunt, which increases pulmonary blood flow. They are acyanotic lesions. If uncorrected, the increased pulmonary blood flow may result in pulmonary artery remodeling and consequent pulmonary\narterial hypertension, which may cause a reversal of the shunt from right to left.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The rotator cuff is the group of muscles and tendons that act to seat the humeral head directly into the center of the glenoid during motion of the shoulder. These muscles also act in concert with other\nmuscles in the shoulder to internally and externally rotate, abduct, and adduct the shoulder. These muscles include the subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. The prime movements of\nthese muscles at the glenohumeral joint include internal rotation (subscapularis), external rotation (teres minor and infraspinatus), and abduction (supraspinatus). The coupling and antagonistic action of\nthese muscles seats the humeral head in the glenoid and provides a stable pivot upon which the larger, more powerful muscles of the shoulder can act, such as the latissimus dorsi, deltoid, and pectoralis\nmajor. A rotator cuff tear typically occurs at the insertion of the tendons of the rotator cuff on the humeral head. Commonly, this occurs in the supraspinatus tendon; however, tears can occur in any of the\nrotator cuff tendons or at the myotendinous Junction. Risk factors for rotator cuff tears include heavy labor, repetitive overhead lifting, diabetes mellitus, and vascular disease. Chronic disease leading to\ntendon degeneration as well as acute or repetitive microtrauma are thought to contribute to eventual tendon failure. The classic presentation of a rotator cuff tear is with pain and weakness in one of the axes\nof motion corresponding with the associated rotator cuff muscle. Late manifestations of a tear include clinically appreciable atrophy of the corresponding muscle. MRI is typically indicated for patients with\nrotator cuff injury to delineate the extent of injury and to determine the need for or to plan for surgical intervention.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Excess free water consumption over a rapid period can lead to acute hyponatremia, which, if severe, may include neurologic manifestations including altered mental status, seizures, central nervous\nsystem herniation syndromes, coma, and death. Acute consumption of free water results in dilution of renal interstitial concentration gradients and limits concentrating ability. Resulting serum and urine\nabnormalities include hyponatremia, low serum osmolality, and low urine osmolality. Hyponatremia, if mild, does not generally cause symptoms or objective examination findings. Treatment of hyponatremia\ninvolves treatment of any underlying disease and gradual sodium correction, typically with fluid restriction in cases of psychogenic polydipsia or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. A safe rate\nof sodium correction is generally no more than 6 to 12 mEq/day. When hyponatremia is corrected too rapidly, extracellular sodium exerts osmotic pressure that leads to the rapid efflux of water from\nneurons, which can lead to demyelination. The pons is particularly vulnerable to demyelinating injury, and the rapid correction of hyponatremia can result in central pontine myelinolysis. In cases of acute,\nsevere hyponatremia with neurologic symptoms of consequence (eg, seizure, coma, herniation, altered mental status), correction with hypertonic saline is appropriate.",

CT angiography of the chest\ncan differentiate types of blunt aortic injury, including aortic dissection, aortic rupture, or pseudoaneurysm. Repair of traumatic dissection of the aorta can be performed via open repair or endovascular repair.\nSuch patients are often critically ill and hemodynamically unstable.

Treatment with opioids typically employs mu opioid receptor agonists, such as morphine, oxycodone,\nhydromorphone, fentanyl, or methadone. Dose titration is often necessary after beginning initial therapy. Oral opioids are typically administered on a fixed, scheduled dose. Breakthrough or progressive pain\ncan be treated by increasing the scheduled dose, usually by at least 25%. The percentage increase in dosage is informed by the severity of pain and assessment of other comorbidities and risk factors for\noverdose.

Reduviidae insects are nocturnal and feed on sleeping human hosts. They are common in rural areas and\ninfest thatched roofs, cracks, or holes in poorly built housing. South American trypanosomiasis manifests with an early, acute stage characterized by mild, nonspecific symptoms of fever, malaise, and\nlymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, which can last for 1 to 2 months and resolve spontaneously. There may be mild swelling and erythema at the site of the bite, commonly on the eyelids or near the mouth.\nSouth American trypanosomiasis is typically curable if treatment is initiated promptly during the acute stage. If not detected or treated during the acute stage, chronic infection typically ensues, which is not\ncurable. Chronic South American trypanosomiasis is characterized by cardiac manifestations, including dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure, along with gastrointestinal\nmanifestations, such as constipation or megaesophagus, which can produce dysphagia, odynophagia, and weight loss. The diagnosis is confirmed with a variety of tests depending on the chronicity of\ninfection and may include peripheral blood smear to detect extracellular parasites, polymerase chain reaction test, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treatment involves prolonged courses of\nantiparasitic drugs, such as nifurtimox or benznidazole. Treatment of the chronic phase is supportive and oriented toward management of cardiac and gastrointestinal complications.",

Purine nucleic acids are metabolized to\nhypoxanthine and xanthine, which are converted to uric acid by xanthine oxidase, resulting in hyperuricemia. Uric acid can crystallize in the renal tubules leading to nephropathy and acute kidney injury, or it\ncan deposit into the joints, leading to arthralgias (eg, gout). Patients undergoing induction chemotherapy should be monitored for TLS and treated prophylactically with aggressive intravenous hydration along\nwith allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, or rasburicase, a recombinant uric oxidase. Treatment of TLS involves supportive care and correction of electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities. Rasburicase is\nhelpful in the treatment of TLS.

If severe, esophageal perforation can result, leading to leakage of gastrointestinal contents into the mediastinum. Treatment is initially\nfocused on supportive measures, including airway management and fluid resuscitation. Visible lesions in the oropharynx increase the likelihood of distal gastrointestinal lesions. Patients should be evaluated\nwith esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGO) to assess for visceral injury.

It can arise anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract and is a subclass of\ninflammatory bowel disease. Most patients experience chronic abdominal cramping, bloody diarrhea, and weight loss. Examination often discloses generalized abdominal tenderness, sometimes worse in\nthe right lower quadrant, and, depending on the severity and extent, may disclose complications such as enterocutaneous fistulas and extraintestinal manifestations such as uveitis. Severe Crohn disease\ncan result in intestinal obstruction from stricture or inflammation, bowel perforation, intra-abdominal abscesses, and the formation of fistulas. Diagnosis occurs through imaging and biopsy. Laboratory\nstudies often show increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein. On fluoroscopic small bowel follow-through, narrowing of the intestinal lumen at the terminal ileum is commonly seen\nalong with other sites of strictures or fistulous formation. Treatment includes anti-inflammatory medications, immunomodulators, and glucocorticoids. Complicated, severe cases may require surgery,\nincluding small bowel resection or colectomy.",

Other direct visualization tests such as flexible sigmoidoscopy may be acceptable for some patients. Other testing strategies include stool-based tests, such as fecal occult\nblood and fecal immunochemical (FIT) tests, and CT colonography. A variety of screening intervals are acceptable and recommended by national governing bodies, with many patients undergoing either\ncolonoscopy every 10 years, annual FIT screening, screening every 10 years with flexible sigmoidoscopy and FIT, or screening every 5 years with CT colonography. In the event that adenomatous polyps or\nearly stage colon cancer is identified, closer follow up may be necessary. Careful risk stratification should be performed based on colonoscopy results to determine an appropriate follow-up interval. This\npatient's colonoscopy shows a polyp with dysplasia, which places him at increased risk for colon cancer. Colonoscopy should be repeated in 3 years for patients with 5 to 10 tubular adenomas or sessile\npolyps less than 10 mm in diameter, one tubular adenoma or sessile polyp greater than 10 mm in diameter, multiple serrated sessile polyps, or adenomas or sessile polyps with dysplasia or with villous or\ntubulovillous histology that are completely removed.",

Both breast milk and cow's milk contain low concentrations of iron. The iron in breast milk has a high\nbioavailability while bovine milk proteins impair iron absorption in human infants. In addition to poor absorption, cow's milk is associated with increased occult enteric bleeding that contributes to iron loss during\ninfancy. Most infants eventually tolerate cow's milk later in life. Iron deficiency anemia early in life can lead to significant neurocognitive and psychomotor impairments that persist even after treatment.",

In a patient with a cardiovascular risk of less than 5%, the risks of a statin medication often outweigh the benefits. In contrast, if a patient's cardiovascular\nrisk is greater than 10%, starting a statin medication is indicated.

Neurons degenerate as a result of an unknown cause that may involve RNA processing and/or excitotoxicity, and gliosis results.\nPatient presentations are variable though typically feature a combination of upper motor neuron (eg, increased muscle tone, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign) and lower motor neuron findings (eg, decreased\nmuscle tone, hyporeflexia, early muscle atrophy) in an asymmetric distribution that may include the bulbar muscles. Some patients may experience cognitive or behavioral changes, though other patients are\ncognitively normal. The diagnosis is primarily clinical but may be supported by electromyographic findings of acute and chronic denervation and reinnervation, along with nerve conduction studies showing\nreduced compound muscle action potentials caused by denervated and atrophied muscles. MRI of the brain and spine should be performed to rule out other diseases. Treatment should include riluzole,\nwhich may modestly improve survival but does not cure the disease.",

ECG is characterized by diffuse ST\nsegment elevation and PR segment depression. If not treated, pericarditis can lead to the development of pericardia! effusions, which, if large and quickly accumulating, can result in cardiac tamponade.\nEchocardiography should be performed to assess for the presence of a pericardia! effusion, which may require pericardiocentesis for drainage, if large. Overall cardiac function (eg, ejection fraction) should\nalso be assessed if cardiac enzyme biomarkers are increased and if there is concern for concomitant myocarditis or heart failure. Treatment includes anti-inflammatory medications, such as indomethacin,\nglucocorticoids, and/or colchicine. Conditions with a similar presentation should also be ruled out, such as acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and aortic dissection.",

Metabolic acidosis is\naccompanied by a decreased bicarbonate concentration in the serum, as bicarbonate is consumed in the neutralization of increased acidic molecules (hydrogen molecules) in the blood.

In the setting of trauma, hyphema occurs as a consequence of damage to the AC angle, iris root, or ciliary body, which are richly vascularized. Immediate and subacute complications of\nhyphema include ocular hypertension, which may lead to glaucomatous optic nerve damage, rebleeding, and corneal blood staining. Corneal blood staining may significantly impair visual acuity and may\nnecessitate corneal transplantation if the central cornea is involved. Chronic complications of hyphema are primarily related to glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve. Hyphema is particularly dangerous in\npatients with sickle cell disease or trait because of the complications of red blood cell (RSC) sickling. Sickled RBCs in the AC are less likely to be filtered through the trabecular meshwork and are likely to\nresult in ocular hypertension. Ocular hypertension may then induce sickling of RBCs in retinal vasculature, leading to irreversible vision loss through induction of retinal arterial or venous occlusions. Most\nhyphemas may be managed medically through topical drops to lower ocular pressure. In patients with sickle cell disease or trait, surgical AC washout is indicated if intraocular pressure is not controlled\nwithin 24 hours.

Symptoms are associated with an imbalance of dopamine and\nacetylcholine, resulting in the characteristic findings of bradykinesia, resting tremor, muscle rigidity, and postural instability. Psychiatric disturbances, sleep disorders, and dementia are common complications\nin addition to prominent motor symptoms. Depression is common in elderly patients with Parkinson disease and other types of dementia, such as Alzheimer dementia. It presents with 2 or more weeks of at\nleast five of the following symptoms: depressed mood, anhedonia (eg, decreased interest in socializing), guilt or worthlessness, difficulty concentrating, suicidal thoughts, and/or neurovegetative symptoms\n(eg, decreased energy, sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance). In addition, patients with Parkinson disease may present with worsening motor function while experiencing depression and are at particularly\nincreased risk for suicide. Treatment of depression consists of pharmacotherapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or atypical antidepressant, such as mirtazapine. Mirtazapine may\nbe particularly useful in patients with insomnia because of its sedating side effects and in those with appetite loss. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also useful for managing depression.",
