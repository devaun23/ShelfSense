Control of psychomotor agitation is the first step\nin management of patients with PCP intoxication for the safety of the patient and medical staff. Chemical sedation with benzodiazepines such as intramuscular lorazepam\nor midazolam can be administered to control symptoms. Once a patient is adequately sedated, further evaluation can be completed to assess for traumatic injuries or\ncomplications of PCP intoxication such as rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, and hypertension.

It is most commonly caused by viral-mediated inflammation or immune reaction in the setting\nof a herpes simplex or herpes zoster infection, although it can be idiopathic or caused by other viral infections or Lyme disease. The facial nerve carries fibers that\ninnervate the muscles of facial expression; therefore, Bell palsy presents with acute unilateral facial paralysis that includes forehead dysfunction. Alternatively, upper motor\nnerve lesions (eg, strokes) manifest with dysfunction of the lower face with sparing of the forehead (since the facial nerve nucleus controlling forehead musculature is\ndually innervated by upper motor neurons from bilateral precentral gyri). Consistent with facial nerve involvement, Bell palsy can be associated with loss of taste on the\nanterior two-thirds of the tongue and decreased lacrimation. Symptoms typically peak around 3 weeks, with slow recovery beginning within 6 months. Diagnosis is typically\nbased on clinical symptoms, but electrodiagnostic tests (eg, electromyelography) and imaging of the face and head can be utilized if the diagnosis is unclear. Initial\ntreatment consists of oral glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, and antiviral therapy in severe cases. Supportive care to prevent xerophthalmia or corneal abrasion should\nbe undertaken (eg, artificial tears, eye patching).",

When infection spreads to the fallopian tubes and\novaries, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can result, which presents with cervical motion tenderness, purulent cervical discharge, uterine and adnexal tenderness, and\nsystemic signs and symptoms such as fever, fatigue, nausea, and myalgias. Complications include tubo-ovarian or intra-abdominal abscess. Gram stain of the urine or\nurethral/vaginal discharge typically does not disclose organisms, as C. trachomatis is an obligate intracellular organism.

The pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy involves nonenzymatic\nglycosylation of the glomerular basement membrane and efferent arterioles. This results in thickening of the basement membrane along with compromise of the filtration\nbarrier, which leads to an increased permeability to solutes and proteins. Mesangial expansion of the efferent arteriole also occurs, which can initially increase the\nglomerular filtration rate (GFR). Diabetic nephropathy characteristically presents with eosinophilic nodular glomerulosclerosis, also known as Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules,\non biopsy. The combination of increased basement membrane permeability and initially increased GFR progresses over time in patients with diabetes mellitus, beginning\nas microalbuminuria, progressing to macroalbuminuria, and eventually to end-stage renal disease. Measurement of urine microalbumin concentration is the most sensitive\ntest to detect albumin in the urine to determine the risk for developing diabetic nephropathy.

Disease manifestations include colitis, retinitis, esophagitis, encephalitis, and pneumonia. The classic\nhistologic findings of CMV infection are mononuclear cell infiltrates with infected cells showing prominent intracellular inclusion bodies. Treatment for all human herpesvirus\ninfections involves drugs that inhibit viral DNA polymerase, classically by using guanosine analogs such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. Prior to exerting their\nantiviral effects, most guanosine analogs must be phosphorylated by the viral enzyme thymidine kinase. CMV does not have the necessary thymidine kinase needed for\nphosphorylation of most common guanosine analogs; however, it does have the necessary phosphorylating enzyme to activate ganciclovir.

While atrial fibrillation can be asymptomatic, symptoms with rapid ventricular response include palpitations, fatigue,\nshortness of breath, light-headedness, angina, and presyncope or syncope. Physical examination will demonstrate an irregularly irregular pulse and occasionally may\nshow signs of heart failure or a heart murmur.

Risk factors for the development of atrial\nfibrillation include hypertension, coronary artery disease, structural heart or valvular disease, pulmonary embolism, lung disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea or\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stimulant abuse, and hyperthyroidism. Complications of atrial fibrillation include tachycardia-induced heart failure, hemodynamic\ninstability, and left atrial appendage thrombus formation with subsequent embolic strokes. Patients with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation should receive evaluation for\npotentially reversible causes with measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration and screening for high-risk amounts of alcohol intake.

Diagnosis occurs through imaging and biopsy. Laboratory\nanalyses often show increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. On fluoroscopic small bowel follow-through, narrowing of the intestinal lumen at the\nterminal ileum is commonly seen, along with other sites of strictures or fistulous formation.

She notes that her lips have become swollen and feel especially \"itchy and tingly.\" She has had three episodes of\ndiarrhea. She appears flushed. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 27/min, and blood pressure is 85/42 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on\nroom air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Examination shows slightly swollen lips and cheeks and erythematous areas over the face and extremities. Breath\nsounds are decreased, and expiratory wheezes are heard throughout the lungs. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. In addition to epinephrine, which of the following\nshould be administered?",

TTP is a life-threatening\ncondition that results in rapid death if not recognized and treated. It is a thrombotic microangiopathy that occurs as a result of inhibition or deficiency of ADAMTS13, a\nmetalloprotease that degrades von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers. vWF is a circulating protein that aids in platelet adhesion and aggregation. Inappropriate activation\nwith impaired degradation leads to the formation of large vWF multimer complexes that obstruct the arterioles and cause mechanical trauma to passing erythrocytes.\nIntravascular hemolysis results in anemia while consumption of platelets leads to thrombocytopenia. End organ damage is also frequently seen as thrombi can obstruct\narterioles. The classic presentation includes the abrupt onset of fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and neurologic symptoms. Increased indirect bilirubin and\njaundice indicate hemolysis, not liver disease. Importantly, patients with TTP will have normal coagulation studies since the disease process does not involve consumption\nof coagulation factors or activation of the coagulation cascade. While TTP can be hereditary, it is more commonly a result of an autoantibody inhibitor against ADAMTS13,\nso treatment is with urgent plasmapheresis to remove the circulating antibody.",

Pterygia derive their name\nfrom the Greek pterygos, or “wing,” for their wing-like appearance. Histologically, pterygia are characterized by degeneration of subepithelial tissue, fibrovascular\nproliferation with destruction of the corneal Bowman membrane, and elastotic degeneration. Pterygia are caused by environmental hazards such as ultraviolet radiation,\nhot and dry climates, dust, and wind. The diagnosis is clinical, and biopsy is not typically required. Patients typically present with symptoms of irritation, redness, foreign\nbody sensation, or blurry vision as a result of obstruction of the visual axis and induction of irregular astigmatism by the pterygium. Treatment includes topical lubrication\nand reduction of ultraviolet light exposure by wearing sunglasses while outdoors. Pterygia may slowly expand over time and extend over the cornea. Patients with\nintolerable symptoms, visual disturbance, or unacceptable cosmetic appearance may require surgical excision. Surgical excision involves complete excision of the\npterygium from the conjunctiva and cornea followed by patching of the conjunctival defect with a conjunctival autograft or with amniotic membrane.

Patients typically\ncomplain of chronic pain in a joint that is worse with movement or exertion and is improved with rest, often with limited range of motion because of underlying joint space\nnarrowing and pain. Imaging may demonstrate joint space narrowing, as seen in the x-ray of the knee, and might show osteophytosis and subchondral cystic or sclerotic\nchanges. First-line treatment is with acetaminophen, although only a minority of patients will achieve meaningful relief with this therapy alone.

Use of\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), even for short durations, is associated with an increased risk for acute myocardial infarction. The mechanism of adverse\ncardiovascular effects is likely related to cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition and disruption of the normal balance of prostaglandins and other arachidonic acid derivatives in\nresponse to endothelial injury. Significant left ventricular dysfunction may result in cardiogenic pulmonary edema with shortness of breath, tachypnea, hypoxemia, audible\nrales, and S,or S, gallop.

Cholesterol\nembolization syndrome occurs secondary to the embolization of atherosclerotic plaque contents (eg, cholesterol crystals) from a proximal large artery (eg, aorta) to distal\nsmall arteries and arterioles. This results in occlusion of the distal arterial vasculature with cholesterol emboli, which induces a localized inflammatory response and end-\norgan damage. Dermatologic manifestations of this phenomenon are localized petechiae, livedo reticularis, and blue toe syndrome. Histology of skin lesions discloses\nbiconvex needle-shaped clefts within the arterial lumen left by dissolved cholesterol crystals. Laboratory findings include increased creatinine and leukocytosis with\neosinophilia. Risk factors for cholesterol embolization syndrome include trauma, interventional procedures that increase the risk for damage and dislodgement of\natherosclerotic plaques such as cardiac catheterization, and aortic dissection.

This patient is likely suffering from asthma triggered\nby an allergen she is exposed to at her new place of employment, given that her symptoms resolve completely by the end of the weekend. Acute episodes typically\npresent with episodes of wheezing, dry cough, and dyspnea. Physical examination often shows tachycardia, tachypnea, diffuse wheezes (rhonchi), and prolonged\nexpiration relative to inspiration. Air trapping may occur during acute episodes, which decreases lung density (leading to diminished tactile fremitus, hyperresonance to\npercussion, and hyperinflation on chest imaging). Pulmonary function tests may be normal between symptomatic exacerbations, but during such episodes, they typically\ndemonstrate an obstructive pattern with a decreased FEV ,:FVC ratio as well as increased residual volume and total lung capacity. A decreased peak expiratory flow rate\ncaused by obstructed airways is expected.\nIncorrect Answers: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and |.\nChoices B and C are incorrect since the peak expiratory flow rate is expected to decrease during an acute asthma exacerbation and the percent reduction from baseline\ncorrelates well with episode severity.\nChoices D, E, and F are incorrect since the FEV ,:FVC ratio is decreased in obstructive lung disease as would be expected during an acute asthma exacerbation. An\nincreased ratio is suggestive of restrictive lung disease caused by decreased compliance of fibrotic lung tissue resulting in greater initial expiratory force.\nChoices G, H, and | are incorrect in the setting of acute symptoms. Choice |, with normal spirometry and peak expiratory flow rate, is expected in between symptomatic\nepisodes when inflammation related to the asthma trigger has subsided and airway obstruction is relieved. The presence of end-expiratory wheezes, hyperresonance to\npercussion suggestive of air trapping, and ongoing symptoms with a continued exposure indicate that pulmonary function is likely abnormal at this time.\nEducational Objective: Asthma is characterized by reversible obstruction of the bronchi secondary to hyperreactivity and airway inflammation.

The diarrhea caused by rotavirus is watery, profuse, often foul-\nsmelling, and typically nonbloody. Children with gastroenteritis are at increased risk for volume depletion in comparison with adults. Clinical signs of volume depletion\ninclude tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, and prolonged capillary refill. Children may present with irritability or lethargy. If\ndiarrhea is severe, laboratory evaluation can show perturbations in serum sodium and potassium concentrations. Severe volume depletion secondary to diarrhea is usually\naccompanied by a significant stool loss of bicarbonate, which, in combination with the hypoperfusion of end organs resulting in lactic acidosis, may result in severe\nmetabolic acidosis. However, in mild cases of diarrhea without significant electrolyte abnormalities, vital sign abnormalities, or signs of shock, and when the patient is able\nto tolerate nutrition by mouth, oral rehydration is the mainstay of management. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is first-line for the treatment of fluid and electrolyte losses\ncaused by mild to moderate gastroenteritis. ORT is advantageous because of its lower cost, ease of administration, noninvasive treatment, and ability to be continued at\nhome by caregivers.",

It is caused by the accumulation of serum ketones such as B-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone in the setting of insulin\ndeficiency or acute catabolic stressors such as infection. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs because of the relative state of starvation\ncreated by absent insulin signaling. Vital signs may show tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension as a result of severe hypovolemia, which occurs secondary to osmotic\ndiuresis from hyperglycemia. Patients may demonstrate physical examination signs of hypovolemia (eg, dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor) along with a\nsweet breath odor secondary to ketones. Laboratory analysis typically demonstrates increased serum glucose and ketones, metabolic acidosis, and a high anion gap\ncaused by the accumulation of unmeasured anions in serum. Metabolic acidosis is accompanied by a decreased bicarbonate concentration in the serum, since\nbicarbonate is consumed in the neutralization of increased acidic molecules (hydrogen ions) in the blood. Patients commonly demonstrate respiratory compensation (an\nincreased respiratory rate and consequently decreased Pco,). The initial management of DKA should focus on volume repletion with isotonic fluids such as normal saline,\nwhich is crucial to hemodynamically stabilize the patient, restore tissue perfusion, and clear ketones. Volume repletion should be followed by insulin, correction of\nelectrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions.",

Adrenal crisis can be precipitated by a\nphysiologic stressor (eg, surgery, trauma, infection) that acutely increases the body’s demand for corticosteroids, which cannot be met because of chronic adrenal gland\natrophy. The patient has also likely not been able to take her oral medications in the setting of a drinking binge and not eating. Adrenal insufficiency presents with\nhypoglycemia, altered mental status, hyponatremia, tachycardia, and abnormal vasodilation. Adrenal crisis is marked by significant volume depletion and fluid- and\nvasopressor-refractory hypotension. While difficult to diagnose because of its nonspecific presentation, acute adrenal crisis should be considered in the differential of any\npatient presenting with circulatory collapse.

It can cause chemical burns and ulcerations of the\ntongue, airway, and esophagus, resulting in stridor, hoarseness, vomiting, and drooling. If severe, esophageal perforation can ensue, leading to free air in the\nmediastinum, known as Boerhaave syndrome, a surgical emergency. Treatment is initially focused on supportive measures including airway management and fluid\nresuscitation. Visible lesions in the oropharynx increase the likelihood of distal gastrointestinal lesions. Patients should be emergently evaluated with esophagoscopy\n(endoscopy) to assess for visceral injury and guide management. For severe injuries, treatment involves steroid administration. In contrast to many toxic ingestions\nactivated charcoal is contraindicated because of the coating of ulcerated mucosa, potential for extraluminal spread into the mediastinum, and impairment of visualization\non endoscopy.",

This occurs when slow-growing cancers that have\na long asymptomatic phase are preferentially detected earlier in their course by the screening. Slow-growing cancers have a longer asymptomatic phase and thus a larger\nwindow during which screening will identify asymptomatic disease. In contrast, fast-growing cancers have a shorter asymptomatic phase because they cause symptoms\nsooner that cause patients to seek medical care. Based on the length of their asymptomatic window, slow-growing cancers are more likely to be found with screening\nCancers that grow slowly are less likely to cause death than cancers that grow rapidly, so if the screening program preferentially identifies slow-growing cancers, then the\noverall survival of patients will be overestimated and will not reflect cases of rapidly growing cancer that caused death. When length bias is present, it may appear that\noverall survival is improved, when the cause of the improved outcome is actually that the slow-growing tumors inherently have a survival advantage over fast-growing\ntumors and are overrepresented in the sample population. Length bias may give the impression that survival has increased as a result of screening, but in fact, the natural\nhistory of the disease process has not changed. Less fatal tumors have just been preferentially identified.",

Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy that is mediated through\nimmune intolerance of the protein gliadin, commonly found in wheat products. This results in inflammatory infiltration of the proximal small bowel, which leads to\ncharacteristic intraepithelial lymphocytosis, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. Malabsorption of substances in the proximal small bowel ensues, which presents\nsymptomatically as chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, and nutritional deficiencies. Patients with celiac disease may develop iron deficiency anemia, which may be present on\nlaboratory evaluation with decreased hematocrit and microcytosis. In children, the introduction of gluten into the diet quickly leads to the development of symptoms which\nmay occur as early as 2 years of age and may lead to decreased growth and nutritional deficiency if untreated. The majority of children with significant villous atrophy will\ndevelop iron deficiency anemia. The presence of unexplained iron deficiency anemia, particularly in the setting of other autoimmune disease, should prompt an evaluation\nfor celiac disease. The diagnosis of celiac disease can be confirmed by the detection of serum anti-transglutaminase antibodies or by small bowel biopsy demonstrating\nvillous atrophy along with intraepithelial lymphocytes and crypt hyperplasia. Treatment includes avoidance of gluten-containing foods and reversal of any acquired\nnutritional deficiencies",

Selective IgA deficiency describes an absence of IgA with normal concentrations of\nIgG, and normal or increased concentrations of IgM. IgA is critical for immune health and functions in two primary ways. First, IgA binds pathogen surface antigens,\ntargeting them for opsonization, complement activation, and phagocytosis. Second, IgA coats mucosal surfaces and prevents colonization, adhesion, and invasion by\npathogenic microorganisms. Immunoglobulins are produced by plasma cells, which are terminally differentiated B lymphocytes; as a result, most causal deficiencies are\nhypothesized to be related to B lymphocyte abnormalities. Despite this, there is clinical heterogeneity in the severity of IgA deficiency. Some patients remain asymptomatic\nwhile others suffer from recurrent sinopulmonary infections. Anaphylactic reactions to blood products such as plasma (which contains donor immunoglobulin) are classic\nbut uncommon, since not all patients with IgA deficiency have reactions to blood products. Such severe reactions are most common in patients with undetectable\nconcentrations of IgA; these reactions occur because of the presence of preformed antibodies against IgA, which in these patients is a non-native protein and thus a target\nof immune activation.",

Measurement of TSH and free thyroxine (FT,) is useful for\nestablishing the diagnosis and typically displays abnormalities consistent with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Some patients display autoantibodies against thyroid\nperoxidase, while some do not. Patients with symptomatic hyperthyroidism benefit from treatment with metoprolol or propranolol. Those with symptomatic hypothyroidism\nbenefit from treatment with levothyroxine. Most patients regain a euthyroid state after several months, although a minority of patients develop chronic hypothyroidism.",

This leads to increased concentrations of glucose in the maternal circulation, and subsequently the\nfetal circulation. Fetal hyperglycemia in turn causes the fetus to produce excess insulin, which acts as a growth factor and leads to macrosomia. Risk factors for gestational\ndiabetes include obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), previous gestational diabetes, and African American, Asian American, Hispanic, Native American, and\nPacific Islander ethnicity.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The quality of a diagnostic test is measured by its sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Positive predictive value (PPV) and\nnegative predictive value (NPV) are statistical measures that define the proportion of positive test results that are true positives (positive tests in patients who have the\ncondition) and negative test results that are true negatives (negative tests in patients without the condition), respectively. PPV is thus defined as (true positives (TP)) / (TP\n+ false positives (FP)), or the true positive rate, and measures the probability of a patient actually having the disease given a positive test result. NPV is defined as (true\nnegatives (TN)) / (TN + false negatives (FN)), or the true negative rate, and measures the probability of a patient being disease-free given a negative test result. Both PPV\nand NPV vary with disease prevalence; PPV varies directly with prevalence whereas NPV varies inversely with prevalence; therefore, the prevalence of a disease must\nalso be known in order to calculate the positive predictive value of the test. In this case, the screening test uses meconium testing to identify neonatal exposure to cocaine\nmetabolites. The prevalence of cocaine use by pregnant women in the community is an indicator of neonatal exposure to cocaine metabolites, or the true presence of the\ncondition that the screening test aims to identify. Thus, prevalence of cocaine use by pregnant women in the community is necessary to calculate the PPV of the test",
