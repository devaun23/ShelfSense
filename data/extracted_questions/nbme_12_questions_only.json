The mother reports that he attends preschool but does not socialize with the\nother children and spends most of the time playing by himself. At school, he is only interested in blocks, reports how tall he can build towers, and resists other activities. At home, he spends hours building\ntowers out of blocks in his room and becomes very upset if he is interrupted. He does not talk about any of his classmates; when his mother invites another child to the house, he has little interest in\nsocializing. His mother reports that he understands directions and communicates without difficulty but has never been very affectionate. He is generally well behaved but will have a temper tantrum if a daily\nroutine is altered or if furniture is rearranged. Pregnancy, labor, and delivery were uncomplicated, and he has reached all appropriate motor milestones for his age. His mother does not recall if language\nemerged somewhat later in him than ii did for her daughter but notes that he makes his needs and wants known without any problem. He is neatly dressed. Physical examination shows no abnormalities.\nOn mental status examination, he makes no eye contact with the physician and perseverates about the towers that he built in the waiting room.

The pain has been occurring earlier during his walks; it slowly improves with rest. He previously walked 1 mile daily for exercise\nand could walk several miles without stopping. He has not had vomiting, fever, chills, or malaise. He has type 2 diabetes mellilus treated with diet. One month ago, his hemoglobin A,, was 6%. Vital signs\nare within normal limits. Examination of the right lower extremity shows mild erythema and a1x1-cm ulcer, with a depth of 3 mm, over the anteromedial aspect of the limb. There is viable soft tissue, and\nmargins are clear. The limb is warm. The popliteal pulse is 1 +. In addition to a recommendation for non-weight bearing and avoidance of direct pressure to the site, which of the following is the most\nappropriate next step in management?\n0",
