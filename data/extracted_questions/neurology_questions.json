Three\nweeks ago, her carbidopa-levodopa dose was increased because of decreased mobility, and metoprolol was added to her medication regimen because of\ninadequate blood pressure control. She smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 10 years ago. She drinks one glass of wine with dinner\nevery night. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 58/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 148/80 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air\nshows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Neurologic examination shows a resting tremor of the hands and cogwhee l rigidity. Deep tendon reflexes are absent at\nthe ankles. Her gait is shuffling. Mental status examination shows a constricted affect. She is oriented to person but not to place or time. She can recall one of\nthree objects after 5 minutes. She says she sees ghost-like figures entering the room. Results of laboratory studies are within the reference range. A CT scan\nof the head shows mild atrophy.
