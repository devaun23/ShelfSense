      "correct_answer_explanation": "Muscle phosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease) is a glycogen storage disease that affects the muscles. It is characterized by the inability of myocytes to break down glycogen as a result of the absence of muscular glycogen phosphorylase, which causes exercise intolerance with fatigue, cramping, and muscle weakness. Muscle cramping may resolve with rest or be permanent. Occasionally, a \"second wind\" phenomenon may be seen when blood flow to the muscles increases after approximate ly 10 minutes of exercise, delivering fatty acids as fuel and relieving the need for glycogen breakdown. Patients may also have episodes of rhabdomyolysis, accompanied by red or brown urine and urinalysis positive for blood resulting from the presence of myoglobinuria without microscopic evidence of red blood cells. A complication of McArdle disease is acute kidney injury and acute tubular necrosis secondary to the release of nephrotoxic myoglobin and heme pigments in rhabdomyolysis.

Cerebellar lesions do not produce esotropia Clinical Please Walt Microvascular damage resulting from diabetes mellitus can produce neuropathy, such as distal polyneuropathy, radiculopathy or, as in this case, cranial nerve palsy. Commonly affected nerves include the abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI), which presents with esotropia, unilateral abduction deficit, and diplopia in horizontal gaze, and the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve Ill), which presents with unilateral ptosis, exotropia, and hypotropia. Patients may experience associated ocular or periocular pain. It is important to exclude other possible causes of cranial nerve palsy, such as stroke, increased intracranial pressure, vasculitis, or optic neuropathy. Most patients with microvascular abducens nerve palsy experience resolution of symptoms over several months following treatment of the underlying cause. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, and I. The cerebellum (Choice A) contains a variety of structures, including the vermis, flocculus, and paraflocculus, which are important for the coordination of ocular saccades, pursuit movements, and gaze holding. Cerebellar lesions do not produce esotropia. Cranial nerve II (Choice B), the optic nerve, carries visual sensory information from the retina to the primary visual cortex via the lateral geniculate nucleus. Optic nerve defects can be caused by demyelination or trauma and present with monocular vision loss. Cranial nerve Ill (Choice C), the oculomotor nerve, is responsible for motor innervation of the levator palpebrae superioris, the superior, medial, and inferior rectus muscles, as well as the inferior oblique muscle. Deficits of the oculomotor nerve present with ptosis, exotropia, and hypotropia. Cranial nerve IV (Choice D), the trochlear nerve, is responsible for motor innervation of the superior oblique muscle. Deficits of the trochlear nerve present with diplopia, hypertropia, and compensatory head tilt. Extraocular muscles (Choice F) may cause diplopia in thyroid ophthalmopathy, orbital mass lesions, or entrapment within a fractured orbital bone. This patient's history of diabetes mellitus suggests microvascular ischemia as a more likely cause of her diplopia. Lesions of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) (Choice G) cause internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), which presents with an ipsilateral adduction deficit, characterized by an inability of the affected eye to cross midline, and an associated contralatera l abduction saccade (as the contralateral eye undergoes more rapid nerve firing to attempt to pull the ipsilateral eye across the midline). Defects of the neuromuscular junction (Choice H) occur in myasthenia gravis, which presents with diplopia and ptosis that worsens towards the end of the day. Defects of the retina (Choice I) may produce visual disturbances but do not cause acute onset diplopia or deficits of extraocular movements."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Patients who chronically use alcohol typically demonstrate a significant vitamin B (thiamine) deficiency caused by poor nutritional 1 intake, thiamine malabsorption, and impaired cellular utilization of thiamine. Over time, thiamine deficiency can result in damage and atrophy of the mammillary bodies, visible on MRI of the brain, which manifests as Wernicke encephalopathy. To prevent Wernicke encephalopathy, all patients with sustained heavy alcohol use should be given oral thiamine supplementation, and patients presenting with acute intoxication should generally be given parenteral thiamine. The typical clinical presentation of Wernicke encephalopathy is a triad of acutely altered mental status, ophthalmoplegia (along with nystagmus), and ataxia. The symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy are reversible but increase the risk for developing Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in patients with alcohol use disorder if not immediately treated with high-dose parenteral thiamine. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is an irreversible condition that features psychosis, anterograde and retrograde amnesia, and the consequent tendency to confabulate, or verbalize false stories or memories, to compensate for the inability to remember.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is the most likely diagnosis in this elderly woman with myalgia, bitemporal headache, and markedly increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). PMR is an inflammatory disorder that often occurs concurrently with giant cell arteritis (GCA), a large vessel vasculitis. Symptoms include proximal muscle and joint (eg, shoulder and hip girdle) pain and stiffness. If untreated, muscle weakness may occur from disuse atrophy. Systemic symptoms such as fatigue are commonly seen. The diagnosis is clinical, and treatment is with low-dose prednisone for up to a year. It is common for patients to respond to prednisone almost immediately, thus the absence of response should prompt consideration of a different diagnosis. As GCA occurs concurrently in up to 20% of patients who have PMR, symptoms of throbbing temporal headache, vision changes, or jaw claudication should prompt temporal artery biopsy and initiation of high-dose prednisone.",

        "D": "Polymyositis is an inflammatory myopathy that can also present with proximal muscle pain, but it is frequently accompanied by weakness. Inflammatory markers may be increased but are nonspecific. Serum creatinine kinase may also be increased and can provide a clue to diagnosis. Muscle biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Choice E) commonly presents with symmetric arthritis of the metacarpophalangea l and wrist joints in younger patients, but may also present with arthritis of the shoulder, elbow, ankles, and proximal interphalangeal joints.

Radiculopathy refers to the neurologic symptoms secondary to the compression of spinal nerve roots either as a result of a herniated intervertebral disc, a narrow or stenotic neural foramen, or compression from extrinsic sources such as tumors or infection. Patients present with pain and occasionally with weakness in the dermatome and/or myotome supplied by the affected nerve root. Radiculopathy is most common in the lumbosacral region. This patient, who presents with sensory changes affecting the buttocks, posterior leg, and lateral foot most likely has radiculopathy from compression of the S1 nerve root. The presence of sensory symptoms in the absence of motor symptoms suggests compression of the posterior nerve root, as this contains sensory fibers. Compression leads to edema and inflammation of the nerve root and surrounding structures, which causes pain. This is most effectively treated with anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen. Over time, most patients will improve with conservative care and graded exercise or physical therapy.",

It does not treat the underlying inflammation associated with radiculopathy and is not considered first-line therapy. Prednisone therapy (Choice D) is not the correct answer. While glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone are sometimes used for patients with acute spinal cord compression from trauma or expanding tumors, there are many adverse effects associated with glucocorticoids. This patient's radiculopathy is more appropriately treated with ibuprofen. Nerve conduction studies (Choice E) can be performed in instances where the examination findings are not diagnostically helpful. In this case, nerve conduction studies would confirm an S1 radiculopathy, but they are not necessary as the diagnosis can be made by physical examination alone."

A positive Exam Section : Item 14 of 50 Clinical Please Walt Correct Answer: B. Herniation of the nucleus pulposus through a tear in the surrounding annulus fibrosus is the mechanism behind a herniated lumbar disc. This herniated disc can potentially compress adjacent spinal nerve roots, leading to severe back pain with associated paresthesia, numbness, pain, and/or weakness of the lower extremities in a dermatomal and myotomal distribution. A herniated disc may be caused by degenerative changes, trauma, or acute strain on the vertebra l column. The L5-S1 disc is the most common site of disc herniation. The straight-leg raise test, or Lasegue sign, is performed by passively flexing the hip while keeping the knee extended. A positive straight-leg raise test is highly sensitive, but not specific, for an ipsilateral herniated disc. In this case, the MRI also shows a posterior herniation of the L5-S1 disc with associated effacement of the adjacent central spinal canal and neural foramen.

It may also cause paresthesias and radiating pain to the buttock or thigh secondary to associated spondylolisthesis. On examination, lumbar extension, not a straight-leg raise, will elicit pain. Mechanical low back strain (Choice C) may result from heavy lifting and typically presents with dull, aching, bilateral low back pain. It does not typically present with radicular or belt-like pain. The straight-leg raise would not elicit pain. Metastatic carcinoma (Choice D) may spread to the epidural space of the spinal cord, which may lead to spinal cord compression. Symptoms of spinal cord compression include lower extremity numbness, weakness, paralysis, abnorma l deep tendon reflexes, perinea! anesthesia, fecal incontinence with poor rectal tone, and overflow incontinence marked by the inability to void with associated urinary retention. Spinal stenosis (Choice E) is narrowing of the spinal canal, often secondary to degenerative joint disease, which results in compression of the nerve roots or spinal cord. Patients may present with symptoms of radiculopathy, including back pain that radiates to the buttocks and legs, leg numbness, paresthesia, and/or weakness. Hip extension increases pressure on the nerve roots, while flexion of the hips relieves pressure in the case of lumbar spinal stenosis."

Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. History of spontaneous abortion (Choice B) does not increase the risk for the development of multiple sclerosis. Numerous etiologies can cause a single occurrence of pregnancy loss. Recurrent pregnancy loss is associated with thrombophilia, such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. These conditions are characterized by a hypercoagulable state with risk for thromboemboli c disease. History of trauma (Choice C) is a risk factor for traumatic brain injury and post-concussive syndrome. The patient does not have a reported history of trauma involving the head. Fracture of a long bone such as the humerus may be complicated by deep venous thrombosis of the upper extremity in the acute setting. Residence in a warm climate (Choice D) is not a predisposing factor for multiple sclerosis. Rather, residence in a temperate climate has been associated with an increased prevalence of the disease. Use of oral contraceptive s (Choice E) increases the risk for venous thromboembolism formation. Patients may present with deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or, less commonly, stroke or transient ischemic attack if a patent foramen ovale or cardiac septal defect is present."

Opioid analgesics are indicated for the management of pain associated with malignancy. Dosage often needs to be increased because of progression of metastatic disease as well as the development of opioid tolerance. Tolerance describes the need for an increasing dose of medication to achieve the same effect as prior doses. This occurs as a result of the downregulation of opioid receptors with recurrent and/or prolonged exposure. It is important to recognize that pain caused by cancer is associated with significant limitations in functional status and quality of life.",

        "B": "Intent to attempt suicide is less likely in this scenario than inadequate pain control. Prescription of opioid analgesics (as well as other central nervous system depressants) carries a risk for unintentional or intentional overdose. Major depressive disorder (Choice C) is associated with many types of cancer, and patients should be assessed for symptoms and self-harm ideations. Patients should also be counseled on the risks of overdose, recognition of the signs of overdose, and prescribed a naloxone kit with instructions on use in an emergency. Substance abuse (Choice D) and surreptitious use of morphine by family (Choice E) are also risks of prescription opioid analgesics, but less likely than inadequate pain control for the dosage increase request in this scenario. It is the responsibility of the prescriber to assess for the inappropriate use of opioid analgesics, such as misuse, diverting pills, or obtaining similar medications from multiple prescribers. A thorough history should be taken to examine for prior difficulties with substance abuse, comorbid psychiatric disorders should be appropriate ly managed, and continuous monitoring for patterns of aberrant behavior should be performed."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Myopathy is a potential adverse effect of long-term corticosteroid use, which is frequently required for the treatment of dermatomyositis. Myopathy occurs as a result of the catabolic effect of glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) on muscle. It typically manifests with the progressive onset of proximal muscle weakness followed by muscle atrophy. Myalgias and muscle tenderness do not typically occur. Other adverse effects of corticosteroids, including a cushingoid appearance, may also be present. Corticosteroid myopathy is not associated with inflammation or cellular damage; thus, creatine kinase and aldolase levels are normal. This is in contrast to dermatomyositis, which is caused by an inflammatory infiltrate of the muscle causing myocyte damage, leading to the release of intracellular molecules, including creatine kinase and aldolase. Active dermatomyositis would also be expected to show cutaneous features such as pink papules over the dorsal fingers (Gottron papules), pink to light purple patches over the upper eyelids (heliotrope sign), light pink to lilac-colored patches with telangiectasias on the upper back and sun-exposed chest (shawl sign), and dilated capillaries with drop out on the proximal nail folds.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Hypothyroidism may present with myopathy and myalgias, typically associated with increased creatine kinase levels. Other symptoms of hypothyroidism are commonly present, including weight gain, fatigue, constipation, cold intolerance, and menstrual irregularities. Physical examination may show bradycardia, dry, edematous skin, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Major depressive disorder (Choice C) is characterized by depressed mood, decreased energy, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, appetite disturbances, guilt, poor concentration, and psychomotor agitation or retardation. Decreased energy or psychomotor retardation may be perceived as muscle weakness, but this patient's history of dermatomyositis, lack of other depressive symptoms, and demonstration of manifestations of glucocorticoid use indicate this as a more likely cause. Peripheral neuropathy (Choice D) has a variety of causes including diabetes mellitus, vitamin deficiency, and medication use, and can be primarily sensory, motor, or both. While motor neuropathy may cause progressive weakness, it is not seen in dermatomyositis and would not explain the patient's cushingoid appearance. Progressive myositis (Choice E) may occur when dermatomyositis is inadequately treated. A perimysial CD4+ T-lymphocyte inflammatory infiltrate causes damage to the myocytes, leading to release of creatine kinase and aldolase, intracellular molecules. This patient's dermatomyositis is well controlled, and the normal creatine kinase and aldolase levels suggest an alternative cause of muscle weakness."

Anticholinergic agents commonly cause cognitive impairment or delirium (an acute confused state) in elderly patients, who possess a decreased cognitive reserve, and are therefore one of a number of medications to use with caution in elderly patients. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine medication used for seasonal allergies and causes anticholinergic adverse effects.

In this scenario, the subacute onset of cognitive symptoms coincides with the initiation of meperidine. Meperidine and diphenhydramine should be discontinued. All elderly patients with new-onset cognitive impairment should be assessed for reversible causes with a thorough history, physical examination, laboratory testing, neuroimaging, and medication review. Incorrect Answer: B, C, D, E, F, and G. Obtaining a durable power of attorney (Choice B), recommending 24-hour in-home nursing assistance (Choice F), and labeling the drawers and cabinets for contents (Choice G) should be considered in patients with irreversible cognitive impairment that prevents them from making their own decisions or functioning at home. This patient's subacute confusion instead coincides with the addition of an anticholinergic medication and will likely reverse with medication discontinuation. This patient's mild cortical atrophy on CT scan may reflect normal aging changes. EEG (Choice C) may assist in diagnosing delirium or cognitive impairment when the cause of mental status change is unclear. However, the diagnosis of delirium or cognitive impairment can frequently be made clinically. This patient with a likely precipitant of cognitive impairment should have the precipitating cause addressed. Fluorescent treponemal antibody assay (Choice D) assists in diagnosing syphilis, which can spread to the central nervous system to cause neurosyphilis. Neurosyphilis may result in a chronically progressive dementia. Though syphilis testing is considered in patients with cognitive impairment who possess risk factors for syphilis, this patient's subacute confusion instead coincides with the addition of an anticholinergic medication. Prescribing an antidepressant (Choice E) would be appropriate in patients with pseudodementia, or cognitive impairment resulting from major depressive disorder. This patient does not show neurovegetative symptoms (eg, decreased energy or changes in appetite or sleep) or other depressive symptoms."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Head trauma, the use of anticoagulants, physical abuse, alcohol use disorder, cerebral atrophy, and malignancy are associated with an increased risk for developing a subdural hematoma (SDH). On imaging, SDH appears as a crescent-shaped collection abutting the internal surface of the skull, not bound by suture lines. In some cases, the SDH may be large enough to compress adjacent brain parenchyma; the displacement of the cerebral hemisphere can result in neurologic deficits, altered mental status, seizures, herniation syndromes, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Patients may manifest upper motoneuron examination findings such as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar reflex (Babinski sign). Elderly patients are at risk for cerebral atrophy, which places traction on bridging cortical veins. In this setting, minor trauma such as falls can result in shearing of the veins leading to hemorrhage. Untreated, the SDH may continue to grow in size. The intracranial compartment is a fixed space within a rigid skull; pathologic lesions such as SDH can result in midline shift and herniation of central nervous system structures if large enough. When such mass effect is present or at risk of developing, surgical interventions such as decompressive burr holes or a craniotomy may be indicated to evacuate the hematoma.",

Imaging may show inflammation in one or both temporal lobes. This patient is afebrile and SDH is more likely caused by the history of prior falls. Severe hypothyroidism (Choice D) can present with altered mental status but would be unlikely to cause focal neurologic deficits. Patients with hypothyroidism typically present with weight gain, fatigue, constipation, cold intolerance, and menstrual irregularities. Physical examination may disclose bradycardia, dry, edematous skin, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. This patient does not show any signs or symptoms to suggest hypothyroidism."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "An abnormality of the facial nerve is the most likely cause of this patient's left facial droop. Involvement of the forehead strongly suggests a peripheral nerve injury as opposed to a central nervous system injury, such as a cerebral infarction, which would cause an upper motoneuron pattern of facial weakness, sparing the muscles of the forehead. When complete ipsilateral facial nerve palsy occurs in isolation, it is known as Bell palsy, which is thought to most commonly be related to the reactivation of herpes simplex virus, though it is often idiopathic. It is typically a benign condition that gradually improves over time, although treatment with oral steroids and occasionally with acyclovir is indicated to expedite recovery. The facial nerve, also known as cranial nerve VII, provides motor innervation to the muscles of the face, parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal, submandibu lar, and sublingual salivary glands, and sensory innervation to the distal part of the tongue and the external auditory canal. Abnormalities of hearing and taste can also occur but typically improve over time.",

        "B": "Muscle is not the correct answer. The facial nerve innervates numerous facial muscles, and it is the loss of innervation that causes weakness; the facial muscles do not exhibit any particular pathology. Myoneural junction (Choice C), also known as the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), is the area where nerve fibers make contact with skeletal muscle. Diseases that affect the NMJ are classified as presynaptic (myasthenic syndrome) or postsynaptic (myasthenia gravis). These diseases typica lly present with diffuse weakness. Patients with Bell palsy have an intact NMJ. Nerve roots (Choice E) typically describe either the anterior (motor) or dorsal (sensory) components of spinal nerves. The two roots join to form a spinal nerve that carries both sensory and motor fibers to peripheral tissues. In contrast, cranial nerves do not have distinct nerve roots."

Acute migraine treatment includes triptans (serotonin 1b /1 d agonists) and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). For patients with disabling or frequent migraines, prophylactic treatment to reduce the frequency of migraine headaches is also recommended and includes ~-adrenergic blocking agents (eg, propranolol, metoprolol), tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and anticonvulsants such as topiramate or valproate.",

Damage to the frontal lobes may occur as a result of trauma, cerebrovascular accidents, tumors, or neurodegeneration.

The frontal lobe is the largest brain lobe, located anterior to the central sulcus, and is divided into three general areas: the primary motor cortex, the supplementary and premotor cortices, and the prefrontal cortex. While the former two areas control contralateral motor function, the prefrontal cortex is an association area unique to humans that mediates motivation, planning, goal-oriented behavior, social behavior, and personality. Damage to the frontal lobes may occur as a result of trauma, cerebrovascular accidents, tumors, or neurodegeneration. Patients typically present with amotivation, poor judgment and planning, behavioral disinhibition, and personality changes. Management involves correcting the underlying cause; however, deficits may not be fully reversible. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E. Dysdiadochokinesia (Choice A) refers to the inability to perform rapid alternating movements. Dysdiadochokinesia typically results from damage to the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere. ldeomotor apraxia (Choice B) refers to the inability to execute a motor sequence despite intact motor abilities. The left parietal lobe (eg, supramarginal gyrus) is the most common site of damage. Prosopagnosia (Choice D), the inability to recognize faces, typically results from fusiform gyrus damage. The fusiform gyrus is located at the border of the temporal and occipital lobes. Spatial disorientation (Choice E), also known as topographica l disorientation, refers to the inability to navigate the environment. Spatial disorientation typically results from damage to the parahippocampal and lingual gyri in the temporal lobe. Educational Objective: The frontal lobe mediates motor function along with higher-order functions such as motivation, goal-oriented behavior, and social behavior. Frontal lobe lesions can lead to problems with conceptual planning, behavioral disinhibition, and personality changes. ., Clinical",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Toxic neuropathy secondary to cisplatin therapy is the most likely diagnosis. The stocking-glove distribution of sensory abnormalities in addition to loss of lower extremity reflexes and proprioception, with a normal Babinski and normal motor function is diagnostic of peripheral neuropathy. While peripheral neuropathy can suggest a wide range of underlying pathologies including uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, amyloidosis, and chronic hepatitis, among others, patients with new-onset peripheral neuropathy should always be questioned about exposure to platinum-based chemotherapy agents, which exhibit a dose-dependent toxic effect on peripheral nerves. Unfortunately, the effect is typically irreversible, although some patients may experience gradual improvement of symptoms over many years. Paraneoplastic syndromes, which are commonly seen in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), can mimic cisplatin-induced neuropathy, but this patient does not have a history of SCLC, and does not appear to have any evidence of a metastatic malignancy.",

Meningeal carcinoma (Choice C) refers to metastatic disease that has spread to the meninges, which can occasionally occur with ovarian cancer. Patients typically present with cranial neuropathies, headache, seizures, and diplopia. Multiple sclerosis (Choice D) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease that most commonly presents in white women around the age of 40 to 50 years. It is characterized by central nervous system demyelination of white matter in both the brain and the spinal cord. This can lead to a variety of neurologic deficits, including weakness, hyperreflexia, and spasticity. Optic neuritis is a classic presenting diagnosis.

Symptoms of MOD include 2 or more weeks of depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, difficulty concentrating, suicidal thoughts, and/or neurovegetative symptoms (decreased energy, sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance). These symptoms disrupt everyday functioning, as evidenced by this patient's poor personal hygiene. Elderly patients may view their neurovegetative symptoms as a manifestation of normal aging or a comorbid medical condition rather than depression. Consequently, depressed elderly patients may struggle to express their depressed mood, though MOD should be suspected in this patient with many other depressive symptoms. MOD in elderly patients can cause pseudodementia, which refers to cognitive impairment secondary to depression, manifesting as this patient's short-term memory difficulties and decreased effort on a brief cognitive screening. Physicians should always inquire about suicida l ideation in patients with MOD. Mood and cognition typically improve with antidepressant medication Clinical by slow speech).

        "A": "Adjustment disorder with depressed mood refers to depressive symptoms beginning within three months of a stressor and associated with a significant impairment in functioning. Dysthymic disorder (Choice D), commonly known as persistent depressive disorder, refers to depressive symptoms lasting longer than two years. Both disorders may include energy, sleep, and appetite changes without meeting the criteria of MOD.",

Delirium presents with acute disturbances in awareness, attention, and baseline cognition that fluctuate in severity over the course of the day. This patient does not show evidence of an acute medical condition or fluctuating cognitive symptoms, rather the patient demonstrates 1 month of progressive cognitive decline. Dementia, Alzheimer type (Choice C) is the most prevalent dementia, presenting with progressive cognitive decline that begins with short-term memory impairment, progresses to apraxia and language abnorma lities, and culminates in behavioral and personality changes preventing the patient from performing basic activities of daily living. Dementia, Alzheimer type, would not present with this patient's constellation of neurovegetative symptoms or this degree of functional impairment after only one month of symptoms. Parkinson disease (Choice F) presents with dysfunction of voluntary movements in the form of bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. Dementia may occur late in the disease course and would not be expected after only 1 month of symptoms. Substance-induced persisting amnestic disorder (Choice G) refers to anterograde or retrograde memory impairment that persists beyond the expected period of intoxication or withdrawal.

Toxop/asma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite. Transmission can occur through the ingestion of oocysts from cat feces or infected meat, direct transmission between a mother and fetus, or from organ transplantation, which leads to invasion followed by dissemination of the parasite where it typically lies dormant. It is a ubiquitous organism and nearly 10% of individuals will be seropositive for T. gondii, but the parasite does not usually cause severe disease in immunocompetent individuals. In patients with HIV infection and CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 100/mm 3, however, reactivation can occur with several distinct clinical syndromes of which cerebral toxoplasmosis is the most severe.

Symptoms include lower extremity numbness, weakness, paralysis, hyporeflexia, perinea! anesthesia, fecal incontinence with poor rectal tone, and overflow incontinence marked by the inability to appropriately void and associated urinary retention. Emergent MRI of the lumbosacral spine is indicated to investigate the cause of cauda equina syndrome, and to determine the necessity of surgical decompression. Initial treatment for patients with epidural spinal cord compression and neurologic deficits include symptomatic treatment, pain control, and glucocorticoid therapy prior to definitive medical or surgical therapy. High-dose glucocorticoid therapy is helpful as a bridge to definitive therapy, as it may transiently improve neurologic function in patients by decreasing edema at the site of cord compression.",

Anticholinergic adverse effects can antagonize muscarinic receptors in the bladder wall, resulting in impaired urinary bladder contractility leading to urinary retention. Other anticholinergic effects can include dry mouth, sedation, constipation, hallucinations, delirium, ataxia, flushed skin, and visual disturbances (cycloplegia). Such effects are uncommon with fluoxetine, and malignant compression is much more likely in this case.",

Small cell carcinoma of the lung is a neoplasm associated with numerous paraneoplastic syndromes, including Cushing syndrome caused by adrenocorticotropic hormone production, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), myasthenic (Lambert-Eaton) syndrome, paraneoplastic myelitis, encephalitis, and subacute cerebellar degeneration. This patient's altered mental status, seizures, and confusion are likely to the result of severe hyponatremia secondary to paraneoplastic SIADH in undiagnosed lung cancer. ADH results in increased aquaporin expression on the luminal surface of collecting duct cells, which increases the membrane permeability to water, leading to inappropriate free water reabsorption, hyponatremia, decreased serum osmolality, and inappropriate ly increased urine concentration. The management of SIADH-associated hyponatremia involves treatment of the underlying disease, restriction of water intake, and gradual sodium correction. If there are associated severe neurologic symptoms, administration of hypertonic saline may be considered to quickly correct the sodium concentration, although this must be performed with caution.",

Baroreceptors are sensitive to mechanical pressure; normally, an increase in blood pressure stimulates baroreceptor activity, which activates a reflex arc. This results in parasympathetic innervation of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes and inhibition of sympathetic vascular tone.

Carotid sinus hypersensitivity syndrome is characterized by an exaggerated response to carotid baroreceptor stimulation, with resultant sinus bradycardia, hypotension, and syncope. Baroreceptors located at the carotid bifurcations and the aortic arch are important in regulating cardiac output and maintaining adequate perfusion pressures to the brain and organs of the upper body.

In turn, this causes decreased pulse and peripheral vascular resistance. Mechanical compression of the baroreceptors from external palpation, such as during shaving of the neck, can potentially stimulate this reflex. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, E, and F. Absence seizure (Choice A) is characterized by a transient blank stare, and typically occurs in brief episodes multiple times throughout the day. It is more common in children. EEG monitoring characteristically shows 3-Hz spike-and-wave complexes during the episodes. Often, patients disclose no postictal confusion. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with absence seizure. Aortic stenosis (Choice B) presents with a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the upper right sternal border with radiation to the carotid arteries. Syncope associated with aortic stenosis typically occurs during exertion because of the inability to increase stroke volume to match perfusion demands, resulting in consequent cerebral hypoperfusion. Syncope during shaving or other mild activities is less consistent with aortic stenosis. Generalized tonic-clonic seizure (Choice D) is the most common type of generalized seizure and is characterized by the sudden onset of muscle contractions followed by rhythmic jerking of the extremities. Bowel and/or bladder incontinence commonly occurs. Episodes are accompanied by a postictal state marked by confusion and fatigue. Neurocardiogenic (vasovagal) syncope (Choice E) is a common cause of syncope, often associated with nausea, lightheadedness, visual disturbances, pallor, and/or diaphoresis. Symptoms usually occur after standing for a prolonged period. A normal tilt test in this patient makes this diagnosis less likely than carotid sinus hypersensitivity syndrome. Transient ischemic attack (Choice F) is defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without infarction. A transient ischemic attack resulting in syncope does not typically present with a postictal state."

It is characterized by the inability of myocytes to break down glycogen as a result of the absence of muscular glycogen phosphorylase, which causes exercise intolerance with fatigue, cramping, and muscle weakness. Muscle cramping may resolve with rest or be permanent. Occasionally, a \"second wind\" phenomenon may be seen when blood flow to the muscles increases after approximate ly 10 minutes of exercise, delivering fatty acids as fuel and relieving the need for glycogen breakdown. Patients may also have episodes of rhabdomyolysis, accompanied by red or brown urine and urinalysis positive for blood resulting from the presence of myoglobinuria without microscopic evidence of red blood cells. A complication of McArdle disease is acute kidney injury and acute tubular necrosis secondary to the release of nephrotoxic myoglobin and heme pigments in rhabdomyolysis.

Mucosal neuromas, growths on the oral mucosa and lips, are a finding of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2B. Other features of MEN2B include medullary thyroid carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma. MEN2B is also associated with neurofibromatosis type I, and these disorders can present simultaneous ly. Neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen disease) is a genetically inherited disorder caused by a defect in NF1, the gene which encodes neurofibromin on chromosome 17. It follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. It is characterized by a constellation of cutaneous manifestations (neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas, cafe au lait macules, and axillary freckling), a variety of central nervous system tumors including optic nerve glioma and iris hamartoma (Lisch nodule), and bony abnormalities such as long bone dysplasia and sphenoid wing dysplasia.

In the primary infection, patients present with subacute fevers, weight loss, night sweats, cough, and malaise. Active tuberculosis is treated primarily with a combination of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. lsoniazid binds vitamin B (pyridoxine) which may result in early excretion and inactivation of pyridoxine, 6 and also inhibits pyridoxine phosphokinase, which is necessary to activate it. Pyridoxine deficiency then results, of which the primary symptoms are peripheral neuropathy or paresthesia. Therefore, all patients taking isoniazid concurrently take pyridoxine supplementation. Pyridoxine deficiency limits synthesis of histamine, hemoglobin, and neurotransmitters including epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and y-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In addition to peripheral neuropathy, deficiency commonly presents with dermatitis, sideroblastic anemia, glossitis, and seizures.",

Folate is contained in leafy vegetables and absorbed in the jejunum. Folate deficiency is often seen in patients with malnutrition, alcohol use disorder, and patients taking anti-folate medications (eg, phenytoin, methotrexate). It is not caused by any of the medications used to treat tuberculosis. lsoniazid (Choice C) binds vitamin B and leads to deficiency if not adequately supplemented. Deficiency of vitamin B causes 6 6 peripheral neuropathy, as in this case.

However, serious side effects also accompany ecstasy use. Autonomic instability (hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperthermia) can lead to life-threatening cardiovascular toxicity. This patient demonstrates another serious complication: hyponatremia secondary to increased water intake and secretion of anti-diuretic hormone. Severe hyponatremia may be accompanied by seizures, as seen in this case, as well as confusion, coma, or death. This is a particular risk in young women.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Patients with ingestion of ethylene glycol may present similarly to patients with alcohol intoxication, with central nervous system effects such as disorientation and altered mental status. Ethylene glycol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to toxic metabolites including glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxalate. These metabolites are directly toxic to the kidneys through tubular damage as well as oxalate crystal precipitation causing tubule obstruction, resulting in acute kidney injury. Oxalate crystals are seen on urine microscopy. These metabolites also contribute to an anion-gap metabolic acidosis. Management of ethylene glycol poisoning involves fomepizo le, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor that prevents metabolization of ethylene glycol to its toxic metabo lites. For severe ingestions, hemodial ysis to remove ethylene glycol and its metabolites may be necessary.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Acetaminophen toxicity is characterized by acute liver failure. At high doses, saturation of phase II metabolic pathways leads to excess acetaminophen being metabolized by cytochrome P450-mediated reactions to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), which has strong oxidizing properties and is directly hepatotoxic .",
        "B": "Arsenic poisoning is uncommon and can cause dermatitis, skin cancer, neuropathy, hepatotoxicity, and in severe cases, systemic toxicity and death. Acute large exposure to arsenic can cause gastrointestina l distress, QT prolongation which may progress to Torsades de pointes, cardiac arrhythmias, shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Carbon monoxide (CO) (Choice C) is a byproduct of combustion and poisoning occurs as a consequence of inhaling the gas. CO has an affinity for hemoglobin that is hundreds of times greater than that of oxygen, readily displacing oxygen from heme. Symptoms of CO poisoning include headache, loss of consciousness, dizziness, vomiting, and fatigue.",
        "D": "Cyanide inhibits the electron transport chain, leading to lactic acidosis, compensatory respiratory alkalosis, hypotension, lethargy, and bradycardia. It would not present with acute kidney injury and crystals on urinalysis.",
        "E": "Ethanol ingestion can present with altered mental status, but metabolic acidosis, crystals on urinalysis, and acute kidney injury are more likely because of ethylene glycol ingestion.",
        "G": "Methanol can be metabolized to formic acid, a toxic metabolite that can cause visual disturbances, retinal edema, optic disc hyperemia, gastrointestinal distress, putaminal hemorrhage, and neurologic depression.",
        "H": "Organophosphate poisoning is caused by increased concentrations of acetylcholine because of the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. Symptoms of organophosphate poisoning include diarrhea, vomiting, urination, sweating, salivation, bronchospasm, lethargy, and possible coma.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "A thorough neurologic examination should include evaluation of the cranial nerves, gait, coordination, movement, muscle strength and tone, light touch, pain and temperature sensation, deep tendon reflexes, and the plantar response (Babinski sign). Deep tendon reflexes can be checked over the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, knee, and Achilles tendons using a reflex hammer. They are graded on a scale of Oto 4 where 0 is absent, 2 is normal, and 4 is clonus (continual contraction). Reflex strength should be compared on either side and within the same patient. The Achilles reflex test is particularly useful for evaluating pathology of the S1 nerve root and differentiating upper from lower motor neuron dysfunction. However, bilaterally absent Achilles reflex is also a normal variation, the proportion of which increases with age. Thus, in this case, the absence of both Achilles reflexes does not require any additional management. Educational Objectives: A, B, C, and D. Measurement of urine lead concentration (Choice A) is appropriate when lead poisoning is suspected. Symptoms of lead poisoning occur within days or weeks of exposure and include distal motor neuropathy. While this does cause hyporeflexia, it would affect all the reflexes in the body, not just the Achilles. It would also cause other lower motor neuron symptoms such as muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations, which this patient lacks. MRI of the lumbar spine (Choice B) would be beneficial in evaluating hyporeflexia because of a spinal nerve or spinal cord lesion. Neither of these pathologies would present with bilaterally absent Achilles reflexes alone without other symptoms like back pain or muscle weakness. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies (Choice C) are used to support a diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Increased serotonin likely explains this patient's sexual dysfunction. Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that increases synaptic serotonin activity and improves mood in patients with major depressive disorder. SSRls commonly cause sexual dysfunction within all three phases of sexual response (libido, sexual arousal, and orgasm). If the sexual dysfunction is persistent and distressing, management commonly involves lowering the SSRI dose, switching to an antidepressant with a lower risk for sexual dysfunction (eg, bupropion, mirtazapine), or adding bupropion or a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor such as sildenafil. Libido is typically enhanced by dopamine and gonadal hormones and may be inhibited by medications such as antipsychotics and SSRls. Arousal is promoted by acetylcholine, which leads to vasodilation of the helicine/vaginal arteries and consequent penile/clitora l tumescence. Medications with anticholinergic activity and SSRls inhibit arousal. Norepinephrine enhances orgasm (and ejaculation), and beta blockers and SSRls inhibit orgasm.",

Medications with anticholinergic activity, which include paroxetine but not sertraline within the SSRI class, may inhibit arousal but would not likely affect libido or ejaculation. y-Aminobutyric acid (Choice B), or GABA, is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. GABA is not known to be involved in sexual response.",

Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, E, F, and G. Ankylosing spondylitis (Choice A) is an autoimmune disorder affecting the axial joints, especially the intervertebral and sacroiliac joints. Patients present with slowly progressive, dull, lower back pain and stiffness that characteristically improves with activity. Patients usually present in the third decade of life and rarely experience burning pain. Atherosclerotic vascular disease (Choice B) may cause claudication, which presents with pain of the lower extremity that occurs in the setting of exercise and resolves with rest. Patients may experience coolness, pallor, hair loss, and poor wound healing of the affected limb. Epidural abscess (Choice D) is a localized collection of pus in the epidural space, typically occurring in the setting of hematogenous bacterial or fungal infection and immunocompromise. Patients may present with fever, back pain, altered mental status, meningismus, and focal neurologic deficits. Low back strain (Choice E) may result from heavy lifting and presents with dull, aching, bilateral lower back pain and with shooting pain toward a lower extremity. It does not typically present with radicular, belt-like pain. Lumbar radiculopathy (Choice F), also known as sciatica, results from compression of a lumbar radicular nerve and commonly results from degenerative spondyloarthropathies and arthritis. Patients typically present with burning or shooting pain that radiates down the back of the leg as well as numbness, weakness, and paresthesia of the foot. This patient's complaint of burning belt-like pain is more consistent with thoracic radiculopathy secondary to diabetes. Lumbar stenosis (Choice G) causes compression of the spinal cord and presents with pain and weakness of the back and lower extremities that is characteristically aggravated by extension of the hip and spine and alleviated by flexion of the hip and spine. Patients may experience radiculopathy, impotence, and incontinence."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Ankylosing spondyl itis (AS) refers to an inflammatory arthritis of the spine and other joints (eg, the sacroiliac joints) along with extra-articu lar inflammation. Patients typically present at younger than age 40 years with insidious chronic low back pain that worsens at night and improves with activity (caused by the mobilization of inflammatory material from joints). This pattern of pain is known as inflammatory back pain. Sacroiliac arthritis and enthesitis (inflammation of the attachments of tendons and ligaments to bone) are other common joint manifestations. Extra-articular manifestations commonly include anterior uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. AS is associated with reactive arthritis, which classical ly presents with post-infectious conjunctivitis, arthritis, and urethritis. Over time, patients with AS can develop decreased spine mobility, hyperkyphosis, osteopenia, and an increased risk for vertebra l fragility fractures.

This patient has multiple risk factors for ischemic stroke including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, atherosclerotic disease, and atrial fibrillation. An embolic ischemic stroke involves an event in which a clot breaks off and travels to the brain, occluding blood flow at a cerebral artery. Emboli can come from proximal vessels, such as the internal carotid artery, or from an atrial thrombus. This patient has an atrial thrombus, which can embolize and cause an ischemic stroke. After a transient ischemic attack, measures for prevention of an ischemic stroke should be enacted. In this patient with atrial fibrillation and a known atrial thrombus, an anticoagulant would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to help prevent ischemic stroke. Warfarin is an anticoagulant that interferes with the carboxylation of coagulation factors. This occurs through the inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase, which is necessary for recycling vitamin K, an essentia l cofactor in the synthesis of coagulation factors in the liver.",

Acoustic neuromas are benign tumors consisting of Schwann cells that arise from the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII). Lesions of the vestibulocochlear nerve typically disrupt ipsilateral hearing and the sensation of head and body position, which leads to difficulty with balance and tandem (heel-to-toe) gait as in this patient. Mass effect from progressive ly enlarging acoustic neuromas can compress the neighboring facial nerve or the upper motor neurons synapsing on the facial nerve, leading to a flattened nasolabial fold and perioral droop. If the upper motor neurons are affected, the forehead is spared, as the facial nerve nucleus that controls forehead musculature is dually innervated by upper motor neurons from bilateral precentral gyri. Because of this, the patient would be expected to symmetrically raise her eyebrows. Alternatively, lesions involving the lower motor neurons of facial expression (eg, facial nerve inflammation in Bell palsy) affect the forehead and lower face together. Depending on patient age, tumor size, and symptom burden, acoustic neuromas can be managed with observation, radiation, or surgery.",

Treatment includes a regular sleep schedule, avoidance of daytime naps, and, in patients with severe daytime sleepiness, modafinil. Modafinil has an unclear mechanism of action that involves increasing orexin and monoamine availability. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, and F. Weight loss program (Choice A), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (Choice B), and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (Choice F) all target obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea features repetitive obstruction of the pharyngeal airway during sleep and typically occurs in older, male patients with obesity as a result of a combination of structural, vascular, and neuromuscular factors. Patients become hypoxemic several times nightly and experience fragmented sleep, leading to daytime sleepiness. REM sleep phenomena during wakefulness is instead consistent with narcolepsy. In patients with suspected narcolepsy, comorbid obstructive sleep apnea should be ruled out with polysomnography.",
        "C": "Phototherapy can be utilized to promote wakefulness in patients with circadian rhythm sleep disorders such as advanced sleep phase disorder. These circadian rhythm disorders do not feature REM sleep phenomena during wakefulness. Phototherapy does not play a role in narcolepsy treatment. Clonazepam therapy (Choice D) may be utilized to treat REM sleep behavior disorder. REM sleep behavior disorder features absent muscle atonia during REM sleep, and patients typically act out their dreams in a coordinated, though sometimes violent, manner. The intrusion of REM sleep phenomena into wakefulness would be atypical."

Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E. Lesions of the auditory cortex (Choice A), located in the temporal lobe, result in impairment of the conscious perception of auditory sensations. The vestibular cortices are instead distributed across the parietal and temporal cortices.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient likely has Sydenham chorea, which is a manifestation of an autoimmune disorder of the basal ganglia. The combination of choreiform movements and migratory joint pain suggest a diagnosis of rheumatic fever, a complication of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) infection. Though arthritis is typically an early manifestation of acute rheumatic fever, Sydenham chorea is a latent manifestation and may occur months after the initial streptococcal infection. In acute rheumatic fever, streptococca l infection causes immune cross-reactivity with neuronal and cardiac cell membrane proteins and the deposition of immune complexes in the joints and soft tissues. The binding of antibodies to basal ganglia neurons results in choreiform movements (involuntary, random, irregular movements) of the face, trunk, and extremities that may be more prominent on one side of the body. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as emotional !ability and obsessive-compulsive disorder (a disorder associated with basal ganglia pathology) may also occur. Sydenham chorea may occur as an isolated manifestation of acute rheumatic fever or in conjunction with arthritis, carditis, erythema marginatum, and/or subcutaneous nodules. As such, patients with Sydenham chorea should receive an echocardiography to evaluate for carditis. The treatment of acute rheumatic fever involves nonsteroida l anti-inflammatory drugs and penicillin to ensure the eradication of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A). Sydenham chorea is typically self-limited, but severe and impairing neuropsychiatric symptoms may be managed with antipsychotic or anticonvulsant medication.",

        "C": "Heavy metal toxicity (eg, copper, mercury) may cause neuropsychiatric symptoms, though chorea would be rare. Wilson disease is associated with copper accumulation in the basal ganglia, which may present as chorea, but this patient lacks other signs of Wilson disease such as liver disease or ocular findings.",
        "D": "Hypercalcemia may present with anxiety, depression, or cognitive dysfunction. Chorea would be atypical.",
        "E": "Hypothyroidism is associated with mood changes but not choreiform movements. Hyperthyroidism is associated with subacute chorea. Tandem repeat mutation on chromosome 4 (Choice F) leads to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient's presenting findings of intermittent ptosis, diplopia, and reduction of extraocular movements are suggestive of myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is a B lymphocyte-driven autoimmune disorder characterized by the formation of inhibitory anti-acetylcholine receptor autoantibodies. Patients typically experience muscular weakness and fatigue that worsens toward the end of the day, as well as ocular symptoms of drooping eyelids and diplopia. Many patients present with ocular findings and later develop generalized symptoms involving the proximal muscles. In severe exacerbations (myasthenic crises), patients may develop weakness of the muscles of the throat, diaphragm, and chest wall, leading to dysphagia and acute respiratory failure. Myasthenia gravis is diagnosed with the detection of serum autoantibodies. A chest x-ray is useful for detecting the presence of thymoma, which frequently produces myasthenia gravis as a paraneoplastic phenomenon. Some patients experience resolution of symptoms after surgical resection of a thymoma, although most patients require treatment with corticosteroids and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (eg, pyridostigmine). Myasthenic crisis is treated with intravenous immune globulin, plasmapheresis, intubation, and mechanical ventilation.",

        "A": "Colon cancer is common in elderly patients, but rarely produces orbital metastases. Colon cancer more frequent ly metastasizes to the liver. While colon cancer may produce paraneoplastic findings, such as the Leser-Trelat sign, characterized by the sudden appearance of numerous seborrheic keratosis on the back and trunk, it does not typically cause myasthenia gravis.",
        "B": "Lymphoma may occur in the orbit, typically involving the conjunctiva or the orbital adnexal tissues such as the lacrimal gland, extraocular muscles, and eyelids. Patients typically present with unilateral proptosis and may present with ptosis or diplopia. However, these symptoms would be progressive and unremitting, rather than intermittent. Prostate cancer (Choice C) is common in elderly males and may rarely cause paraneoplastic syndromes. However, it does not typically cause myasthenia gravis, which is observed more frequently in association with thymoma. Small cell lung carcinoma (Choice D) may cause the paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), which is characterized by the formation of autoantibodies against presynaptic calcium channels and by impairment of acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. While LEMS may present with similar symptoms to myasthenia gravis, it rarely affects the extraocular muscles."

The right superior division travels through the right parietal lobe and carries information from the right inferior visual fields. In contrast, the right inferior division travels through the right temporal lobe by looping around the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle, forming the Meyer loop, and carries information from the right superior visual fields.

Patient presentations are variable, though typically feature a combination of upper motor neuron (eg, increased muscle tone, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign) and lower motor neuron findings (eg, decreased muscle tone, hyporeflexia, early muscle atrophy) in an asymmetric distribution that may include the bulbar muscles. Some patients may experience cognitive or behavioral changes, though other patients are cognitively normal. The diagnosis is primarily clinical but may be supported by electromyographic findings of acute and chronic denervation and reinnervation. MRI of the brain and spine should be performed to rule out other diseases. Treatment should include riluzole, which may modestly improve survival but does not cure the disease.",

However, generalized dysfunction in both an upper and lower motor neuron pattern is more consistent with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Neuronal ganglioside GM deposition (Choice E) occurs in Tay-Sachs disease, a heritable lysosomal storage disease that presents with 2 motor neuron degeneration. A combination of upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron dysfunction is possible, but symptoms typically begin in infancy and are usually symmetric. Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra (Choice F) occurs in Parkinson disease and leads to resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability.

Dopamine agonists (Choice B) increase dopamine signaling and therefore relieve parkinsonism. This patient does not demonstrate motor findings typical of Parkinson disease such as tremor, bradykinesia, or postural instability. NMDA receptor agonists (Choice C), such as endogenous glutamate, mediate activity-dependent synaptic changes of learning and memory.

Patients with moderate to severe AD ( eg, a mini-menta l state examination score less than 18) may modestly benefit from memantine monotherapy if they cannot tolerate cholinesterase inhibitors. However, cholinesterase inhibitors are the first-line medications for AD of all severities, and this patient does not have moderate to severe dementia.

Common causative agents are antipsychotics (especia lly high-potency antipsychotics Clinical Correct Answer: E. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is most likely in this patient who has received high-potency antipsychotic medication. NMS is a life-threatening condition associated with the antagonism of dopamine that presents with altered mental status, muscle rigidity or tremor, hyperthermia, and autonomic dysfunction. Common causative agents are antipsychotics (especia lly high-potency antipsychotics such as haloperidol) and antidopaminergic nausea medications. Rigidity and tremor result from dopamine antagonism in the nigrostriatal pathway, while autonomic dysfunction and hyperthermia may result from dopamine antagonism in the hypothalamus. Characteristic laboratory abnormalities include leukocytosis along with increased serum concentration of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase (as a result of prolonged muscle rigidity and consequent myolysis). Treatment is supportive and includes discontinuation of the offending medication, hydration, cooling blankets, and benzodiazepines if needed for agitation. Dantrolene is potentially beneficial.",

        "A": "related fever is unlikely in this patient. While some antibiotics can cause mild increases in body temperature, marked hyperthermia is not a common side effect of antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, this patient is not currently taking antibiotics. Herpes encephalitis (Choice B) presents with fever, altered mental status, and neurologic abnormalities, such as seizure, aphasia, hemiparesis, or cranial nerve deficits. Neuroimaging will typically demonstrate changes in the temporal lobe. Encephalitis is commonly associated with nuchal rigidity, which this patient does not demonstrate, making herpes encephalitis a less likely cause of his presentation. Additiona lly, an increased creatine kinase concentration is not consistent with herpes encephalitis. Lithium toxicity (Choice C) presents with nausea, vomiting, dysrhythmias, altered mental status, and neuromuscu lar excitability, such as tremors in acute toxicity. Chronic toxicity has more prominent neurologic symptoms and can also cause nephrogenic diabetes insipid us. Malignant hyperthermia (Choice D) is caused by a genetic defect in the ryanodine receptor and presents with muscle rigidity, tachycardia, fever, lactic acidosis, and hypercarbia when the patient is exposed to succinylcholine or volatile anesthetics. While the presentation is similar to NMS, this patient has not been exposed to agents that trigger malignant hyperthermia since his surgery, making this a less likely cause of his illness. Postoperative sepsis (Choice F) presents with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis, as well as hypotension and lactic acidosis if the patient is in septic shock, in the setting of a known or suspected infection. It is rarely associated with hypertension. Furthermore, this patient has no signs of infection on physical examination."

Alcohol abuse (Choice B) may cause peripheral neuropathy as a result of vitamin deficiency, but this more often manifests with gait instability than muscle weakness. Guillain-Barre syndrome (Choice C) is a demyelinating polyneuropathy that starts with the distal extremities and progresses proximally. It may affect the lungs through diaphragmatic paralysis, which is the most serious complication of the disease. Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson disease) (Choice D) is caused by decreased ceruloplasmin concentrations which cause excess copper to accumulate both inside and outside the liver. While the presentation is varied, some degree of liver disease is almost always seen at the time of diagnosis, which this patient does not demonstrate.

An injury at the level of T10 can affect sympathetic efferent fibers that provide inhibitory input to the bladder and urethra via the hypogastric nerve. Sympathetic stimulation through these fibers usually causes relaxation of bladder musculature and contraction of urethral sphincter, resulting in urinary retention. Injury to these fibers will cause urinary incontinence as a result of impaired inhibition of bladder contraction.

An injury at the level of the thoracic spinal cord would affect the thoracic cord and may also affect segments distal to the level of the injury, including the lumbosacral segments that innervate lower extremity musculature and sensation. An injury at the level of T10 can affect sympathetic efferent fibers that provide inhibitory input to the bladder and urethra via the hypogastric nerve. Sympathetic stimulation through these fibers usually causes relaxation of bladder musculature and contraction of urethra l sphincter, resulting in urinary retention. Injury to these fibers will cause urinary incontinence as a result of impaired inhibition of bladder contraction. Spinal cord pathologies that result in urinary incontinence result in complex interactions between signals from the parasympathetic, sympathetic, and somatic nervous systems and may present with urge or overflow incontinence, altogether termed neurogenic bladder. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Compression of the conus medullaris (Choice A) often occurs at the level of L2. It can also present with sphincter dysfunction, spastic or flaccid paralysis, as well as saddle anesthesia. An injury at T10 would be unlikely to affect the conus medullaris. Compression of the S3-4 nerve roots (Choice B) describes cauda equina syndrome. Cauda equina syndrome presents with low back pain, weakness of lower extremities, bladder and rectal sphincter paralysis leading to urinary retention, and sensory deficits. Compression of the T10-11 nerve roots (Choice C) would result in a thoracic radiculopathy in a dermatomal distribution resulting in pain and numbness around the umbilicus.

Patients would present with a lower-motor neuron pattern of weakness with decreased reflexes. However, anterior horn cell disease is not associated with lung cancer. Disease of the muscle (Choice B) such as polymyositis or muscular dystrophy may present with proximal muscle weakness. However, because of muscle degeneration, creatine kinase concentrations would be increased, and polymyositis would additionally present with muscle pain and stiffness. Further, these diseases are not associated with the paraneoplastic production of antibodies. Disease of the peripheral nerve axon (Choice D) occurs in axonal polyneuropathy, a rare form of Guillain-Barre syndrome that involves the autoimmune attack of the spinal nerve root axons. Peripheral nerve demyelination (Choice E) occurs in Guillain-Barre syndrome, which results in destruction of the myelin on the spinal nerve roots. Both syndromes typically present with acute-onset, symmetric, ascending muscle weakness with hyporeflexia and may include sensory and autonomic dysfunction. This patient instead presents with the insidious onset of muscle weakness that begins in the proximal, rather than distal, lower extremities. Spinal cord disease (Choice F), such as transverse myelitis, could cause acute bilateral motor dysfunction of the lower extremities.

Lumbar puncture and cerebrospina l fluid analysis confirm the diagnosis. Treatment requires restarting antiretroviral therapy. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Central nervous system lymphoma (Choice A), or primary CNS lymphoma, is a rare variant of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs most commonly in immunocompromised patients. Typical presentation includes focal neurological deficits, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, positional headache, nausea, vomiting). MRI typically demonstrates a solitary mass lesion but can reveal multiple periventricular white matter mass lesions. Primary CNS lymphoma lesions do not involve demyelination and are more likely to produce a mass effect than PML lesions. Dementia, Alzheimer type (Choice B) results from decreased cholinergic signaling in the cortex and basal forebrain. Alzheimer dementia is the most prevalent dementia, presenting with progressive cognitive decline that culminates in the inability to perform basic activities of daily living. Alzheimer dementia is not associated with personality changes early in the disease course, demyelination, or . . 1mmunosuppress1on. Multiple sclerosis (Choice C) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease that presents with focal neurologic deficits separated in space and time. Cortical atrophy would be atypical, and multiple sclerosis is not associated with immunosuppression. Pick disease (Choice D), or frontotemporal dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, causing deficits in social behavior or personality along with dementia. Frontotemporal dementia is not associated with demyelination or immunosuppression."

A previously healthy 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of progressive weakness, numbness, and tingling of both arms. Her pulse is 70/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. Muscle strength is 3/5 in the upper extremities and 4/5 in the lower extremities. There is muscle wasting and atrophy of the forearms and hands bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are absent in the upper extremities and 4+ in the lower extremities. Babinski sign is present bilaterally. There is decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch in the upper extremities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis B) Guillain-Barre syndrome C) Postherpetic neuralgia D) Syringomyelia E) Tabes dorsalis Correct Answer: D. This patient presenting with an upper motor neuron pattern of dysfunction in the lower extremities and a lower motor neuron-pattern of dysfunction in the upper extremities likely has syringomyelia. Syringomyelia features a progressively expanding cystic lesion involving midline spinal cord structures. Syringomyelia may be associated with congenital malformations such as Chiari type I malformation, spinal cord infections, autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, neoplasms, or spinal cord trauma. Syringomyelia typically damages spinothalamic fibers decussating in the anterior white commissure. Consequent ly, patients present with deficits in pain and temperature sensation in the bilateral upper extremities (since the ascending spinothalamic tracts in the lateral spinal cord are unaffected, sensation in the lower body is intact). The spinothalamic tract also carries sensory fibers that mediate poorly localized light touch (versus localized light touch fibers of the posterior columns). The cystic lesion can expand to the bilateral anterior horns (the location of the cell bodies of lower motor neurons). Therefore, patients may also present with a lower motor neuron pattern of dysfunction in the bilateral upper extremities (eg, decreased muscle tone, hyporeflexia, early muscle atrophy). The cyst may also progressive ly expand to the lateral corticospinal tract in severe cases, leading to an upper motor neuron pattern of dysfunction (eg, spastic weakness, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski sign) in the lower body. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Choice A) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the anterior horns along with the lateral corticospinal tract as it descends in the brain and spinal cord. Subsequently, patients demonstrate a combination of upper and lower motor neuron findings in an asymmetric distribution that may include the bulbar muscles. Sensory impairment would be atypical, and a pattern of dysfunction that can be localized to a single lesion within the cervical spine is more consistent with syringomyelia.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Occlusion of the right posterior cerebral artery (PCA) explains this patient's deficits. The PCA supplies much of the occipital lobes as well as the inferomedial temporal lobe, posteromedial parietal lobe, thalamus, and parts of the brainstem. Visual symptoms are a prominent feature of a PCA territory infarction and include cortical blindness, contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing, visual agnosia, and prosopagnosia. Occlusion of the right PCA typically leads to left homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing (caused by damage of the right primary visual cortex) and may lead to left hemineglect (caused by damage of the right parietal cortex). Left homonymous hemianopia likely explains this patient's car accident and may lead to mild balance difficulties. Occlusion of the right PCA may also result in left hemisensory deficit (caused by thalamus damage) and left hemiparesis (caused by damage to the cerebral peduncles in the midbrain). Cerebral infarctions, also known as strokes, occur as a result of ischemic or hemorrhagic loss of blood supply to the brain. Approximately 80% to 85% of strokes are ischemic, commonly arising from thromboembolic disease (eg, middle cerebral artery occlusion from a thrombus), whereas 15% to 20% of strokes are hemorrhagic because of blood vessel rupture (eg, hypertension-related intraparenchymal hemorrhage from a perforating artery). Risk factors for stroke include smoking, hypertension, diabetes, carotid or intracranial atherosclerotic disease, history of hypercoagulabi lity, atrial fibrillation, and advanced age. Classically, strokes manifest as a neurologic deficit related to the affected part of the brain.",

A 72-year-old woman is brought to the physician 2 hours after the sudden onset of dim vision in her right eye. Her symptoms began 3 weeks ago with generalized stiffness, aches in the morning, and a bitemporal headache. Examination shows firm, tender temporal arteries bilaterally. Corrected visual acuity is 20/200 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left.

A) Carotid angiography now B) Aspirin therapy now and temporal artery biopsy within 24 hours C) Corticosteroid therapy now and temporal artery biopsy within 3 days D) Plasmapheresis now E) Temporal artery biopsy now with therapy determined by pathology Correct Answer: C. This patient's presenting findings of abrupt onset monocular vision loss, headache, stiffness, and temporal tenderness are consistent with a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is an autoimmune inflammatory vasculitis of medium and large vessels. Classic findings include systemic symptoms of fever, chills, and weight loss, headache, history of preceding transient vision loss (amaurosis fugax), jaw claudication, tenderness of the scalp, and pale optic disc edema. New headaches in an elderly patient should raise suspicion for GCA. GCA frequently occurs in association with polymyalgia rheumatica, which is characterized by stiffness of proximal muscles. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates increased inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein concentration, and thrombocytosis. GCA is characterized by a predilection for the vessels of the head and neck, and often affects the ophthalmic artery, inflammatory occlusion of which can result in sudden, ischemic damage to the retina. Once vision loss occurs it is not reversible and is commonly followed by vision loss in the contralateral eye within days or weeks. The diagnosis is confirmed with biopsy of the temporal artery demonstrating granulomatous vasculitis. Treatment with high dose corticosteroids should occur immediately once GCA is suspected in order to preserve vision. Corticosteroid treatment does not generally compromise biopsy results as long as the biopsy is performed within 1 to 2 weeks. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E. Carotid angiography (Choice A) is not a preferred diagnostic method for the detection of GCA. Temporal artery biopsy remains the standard diagnostic test.

Carotid angiography (Choice A) is not a preferred diagnostic method for the detection of GCA. Temporal artery biopsy remains the standard diagnostic test. Steroid treatment should not be deferred while pursuing other tests. Immediate aspirin therapy and temporal artery biopsy within 24 hours (Choice B) is incorrect. Aspirin does not provide a sufficiently robust anti-inflammatory effect to protect the ophthalmic artery from inflammation caused by GCA, which requires high-dose corticosteroids. Plasmapheresis (Choice D) is not commonly used for the treatment of GCA. GCA is characterized by granulomatous vasculitis and is therefore driven, at least in part, by a T lymphocyte and macrophage autoimmune response. Plasmapheresis is especially useful for the treatment of B lymphocyte driven autoimmune disorders, such as myasthenia gravis. Immediate temporal artery biopsy with treatment to be determined by pathology (Choice E) is not appropriate. Once the diagnosis of GCA is suspected, high-dose corticosteroid treatment should start immediately. Delaying initiation of corticosteroid therapy even by hours while awaiting biopsy results puts the patient at risk for preventable and irreversible blindness. Educational Objective: Giant cell arteritis is a common vasculitis of medium and large vessels in elderly patients and commonly presents with systemic symptoms, headache, jaw claudication, and proximal muscle stiffness. Vasculitis of the ophthalmic artery may occur and cause blindness.

Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, E, F, and G. Behget syndrome (Choice A) is a vasculitis that commonly presents in patients 20 to 40 years of age with mucocutaneous ulcers, including oral and urogenital lesions. Other symptoms include erythema nodosum, uveitis, and neurologic abnormalities. It can present with brain lesions on MRI, but they are more commonly subcortical and would be unlikely to be calcified. Central nervous system lymphoma (Choice B) is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs most commonly in immunocompromised patients and presents with focal neurologic deficits, increased intracrania l pressure (eg, headache), vision changes, and personality changes depending on the location of the lesion. Neuroimaging will most commonly reveal a well circumscribed solitary lesion near the ventricles, rather than the multiple lesions seen in this patient. Metastatic carcinoma (Choice C) can present with multifocal cerebral lesions. Lung cancer, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma commonly metastasize to the brain. Brain metastases typically present with focal neurologic deficits, headache, and seizures.

Patients may be asymptomatic or experience seizures or focal neurologic deficits related to the tumor location. Meningiomas are typically benign but can be malignant. Malignant meningiomas may grow rapidly, leading to symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (eg, postural headache, nausea, papilledema), or may metastasize. Meningiomas appear as well-circumscribed, extra-axia l (ie, outside of the brain parenchyma) masses that compress the parenchyma. They show uniform enhancement on imaging. Definitive diagnosis requires histologic examination of tissue, which will show spindle cells arranged in a whorled pattern with psammoma bodies.

Autonomic dysfunction may occur but is typically mild. Sensory deficits may occur (though these symptoms are typically mild compared to motor dysfunction). A slowing of conduction velocity on nerve conduction studies indicates demyelination and supports the diagnosis. The diagnosis is further supported by increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell counts on lumbar puncture, termed albuminocyto logic dissociation and thought to reflect generalized inflammation.

Pyridoxine deficiency results, of which primary symptoms are peripheral neuropathy and paresthesia. Pyridoxine deficiency limits synthesis of histamine, hemoglobin, and neurotransm itters including epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and y-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In addition to peripheral neuropathy, deficiency commonly presents with dermatitis, sideroblastic anemia, glossitis, and seizures.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Multiple sclerosis (MS), the most prevalent immune-mediated demyelinating disease, may present with episodic or progressive neurologic dysfunction. According to the McDonald criteria for MS diagnosis, patients must have evidence of demyelinating lesions that are separated in time and location. This evidence is typically based on subjective symptoms and radiologic studies. Lesions affecting the left medial longitudina l fasciculus (leading to decreased medial gaze of the left eye), the prefronta l cortex or corticobulbar tracts (leading to pseudobu lbar affect, or uncontrollable crying), and the major central nervous system (CNS) tracts innervating the extremities (lesions of the corticospina l tract causing Babinski sign, spinothalamic tract causing decreased pinprick, dorsal column-media l lemniscus causing Romberg sign and paresthesia) are likely separated in space. This patient experienced two discrete periods of symptom onset at 6 months and 2 months, illustrating separation in time. MRI typically shows white matter hyperintensities in the periventricular region, cortex, subcortical region, cerebellum, or spine. Oligoclonal bands of immunog lobulins, indicating immune overactivation, can be found in the cerebrospinal fluid but are not necessary for diagnosis. Treatment includes corticosteroids for symptomatic management of acute flares and long-term disease-modifying treatments such as interferon or monoclonal antibodies.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "EEG assists in diagnosing seizures. Hypothalamic seizures can lead to uncontrollable crying. However, seizures typically last seconds to minutes; months of persistent sensory and motor dysfunction would be atypical. Measurement of serum ammonia concentration (Choice B) supports a diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy presents acutely with confusion or stupor along with neurologic symptoms such as asterixis, tremor, myoclonus, and frontal release signs. Measurement of serum calcium concentration (Choice C) would confirm hyper- or hypocalcemia. Hypercalcemia typically presents with confusion, fatigue, polyuria, constipation, and bone pain. Hypocalcemia features muscle spasms, paresthesias, circumoral numbness, and seizures. Measurement of serum copper concentration (Choice D) diagnoses Wilson disease, in which copper accumulates in the liver, brain, and eyes. Though mood swings and extrapyramidal symptoms (from copper deposits in the basal ganglia) may occur, months of medial gaze palsy along with sensorimotor dysfunction would be atypical. Measurement of serum vitamin B (cobalamin) concentration (Choice E) helps in diagnosing subacute combined degeneration, 12 affecting the spinocerebel lar tracts, lateral corticospina l tracts, and dorsal columns. Measurement of urine porphobilinogen concentration (Choice F) assists in diagnosing acute intermittent porphyria, which is characterized by episodic abdominal pain, polyneuropathy, psychologica l symptoms, and port wine-colored urine. Serum antinuclear antibody assay (Choice H) can assist in diagnosing autoimmune diseases affecting the CNS and are expressed at decreased concentrations in multiple sclerosis. However, characteristic MRI findings are more specific for MS.

A 27-year-o ld nulligravid woman has had cafe au lait spots and multiple neurofibromas since birth. A diagnosis of neurofibromatos is is made. She is concerned that she might pass this condition on to her children. Her parents and three siblings do not have this disorder. The risk for neurofibromatosis in her children is closest to which of the following? A) 50% for each child, since neurofibromatosis is autosomal dominan t B) 25% for each child, since neurofibroma tosis is autosoma l recessive C) 10% for each child, since neurofibroma tosis is controlled by severa l genes D) No risk, since neurofibromatos is is not a genetic disorder E) No risk, since the patient represe nts a new mutation Correct Answer: A. Neurofibromatosis type I is a genetically inherited disorder caused by a defect in NF1, the gene which encodes neurofibromin on chromosome 17. It follows an autosoma l dominant pattern of inheritance. It is characterized by a constellation of cutaneous manifestations (eg, neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas, cafe au lait spots, and axillary freckling), a variety of central nervous system tumors including optic nerve glioma and iris hamartoma (ie, Lisch nodule), and bony abnorma lities such as long bone dysplasia and sphenoid wing dysplasia. Patients are also at higher risk for developing astrocytomas, brainstem gliomas, and soft tissue sarcomas. Because it follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, only one alle le is needed to develop the condition.

The frontal lobe is the largest lobe of the cerebral cortex, separated from the parietal lobe by the central sulcus. The major areas of the frontal lobe are the primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, prefrontal cortex, Broca area, and the frontal eye fields. Symptoms depend on the location of the lesion. Involvement of the primary motor cortex and premotor cortex result in impaired motor function of the contralateral side of the body and psychomotor retardation. Disruption of Broca area may cause expressive aphasia with retention of language comprehension. Lesions of the frontal eye fields result in ipsilateral deviation of the eyes. Dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex can result in disinhibition, apathy, personality changes, aggressive behavior, and impairments in judgement, concentration, and orientation, as exhibited by this patient. Patients should be evaluated for other medical causes of cognitive impairment, such as vitamin B (cobalamin) deficiency, hypothyroidism, syphilis infection, and 12 intoxication.

Further suggestive is the presence of erythrocytes in the CSF which is often seen in herpetic encephalitis. Most cases of HSV encephalitis are caused by HSV-2, although infection with HSV-1 occurs and is treated in the same way. Most patients acquire the virus via transmission from the mother, often during the third trimester, with encephalitis developing usually within a week. Symptoms are nonspecific and include fever, lethargy, poor feeding, and occasionally seizures or focal neurologic deficits. Concomitant oral lesions may occur, but their absence does not rule out the diagnosis. The CSF findings include increased protein, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and a normal or low-normal glucose concentration. In many instances the causative virus can be identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the CSF, although empiric therapy with intravenous acyclovir is warranted prior to diagnosis. Failure to recognize and treat infection can result in organ dysfunction and death, or long-term neurologic sequelae.",

Congenital infection with syphilis (Choice B) presents typically within five weeks with hepatomegaly, maculopapular rash, rhinitis, and skeletal abnormalities including periostitis or bone demineralization. CSF findings may show pleocytosis and increased protein but would be positive for Treponema pal/idum. Congenital infection with toxoplasmosis (Choice C) may present with chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and seizures. Toxoplasma gondii can be detected in the CSF. lntracranial calcifications may be present on CT scan. Neonatal Escherichia coli meningitis (Choice D) may present with fever, lethargy, and hypotonia, and CSF findings would include a neutrophilic pleocytosis with a decreased glucose concentration. Treatment is with ampicillin if the organism is sensitive, or with a cephalosporin combined with gentamicin. Neonatal group B streptococcus (GBS) meningitis (Choice E) presents similarly to E. coli meningitis but is more common in patients born to mothers who are colonized with GBS who have not received prophylactic treatment. Colonization is usually detected and treated prior to delivery, and if the status is unknown, prophylactic antibiotics are given."

A) Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicit~ B) Cerebellopontine angle tumor C) Meniere disease D) Pontine infarction E) Vestibular neuronitis Correct Answer: A. Ototoxicity is a frequent adverse effect of aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin, which exert bactericidal effects by binding the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Aminoglycosides accumulate in the inner ear endolymph and perilymph, and can cause cochlear ototoxicity and vestibulotoxicity, which is typically irreversible. The risk for ototoxicity associated with aminoglycosides may be as high as 10% in some patient populations. While there is an increased risk for ototoxicity with repeat dosing or with high doses, ototoxicity may occur with even the first dose of aminoglycoside. While aminoglycosides are high ly effective against a broad range of Gram-negative bacterial infections, such as with Escherichia coli, Klebsiel/a, Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Serratia species, their use is limited by their significant adverse effects. In addition to ototoxicity and vestibulotoxicity, aminoglycosides are also associated with nephrotoxicity. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Cerebellopontine angle tumor (Choice B), such as an acoustic neuroma, meningioma, or glioma, typically affects the vestibulococh lear nerve and other cranial nerves (eg, trigeminal, abducens, facial nerves). Patients may present with hearing loss and vertigo; sensory and motor dysfunction of the face and/or extraocular muscles are also possible. Meniere disease (Choice C) is a condition of episodic vertigo and sensorineural hearing loss that results from pressure accumulation in the endolymph of the inner ear.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Carbidopa-levodopa is a dopamine agonist used to treat Parkinson disease by increasing the amount of dopamine available in the nigrostriatal pathway. Carbidopa and levodopa are given together in order to increase availability of levodopa to the brain. Levodopa is converted to dopamine by the enzyme dopa decarboxylase in the peripheral circulation and the brain. Dopamine is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), so any levodopa which is converted to dopamine peripherally is unable to effect change in the basal ganglia. Carbidopa indirectly increases dopamine availability in the basal ganglia by inhibiting dopa decarboxylase peripherally. In this way, more levodopa is able to cross the BBB and be converted to dopamine in the brain, where it is then able to act on the nigrostriatal pathway. Increased dopamine leads to improvement of Parkinson disease symptoms including the tremor, rigidity, akinesia, and postural instability shown by this patient.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Methylphenidate is a non-amphetamine central nervous system stimulant medication that is used in the treatment of narcolepsy, which is the most likely diagnosis in this patient with fatigue and episodes of cataplexy. Methylphenidate works by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into presynaptic neurons. The pathogenesis of narcolepsy involves the loss of orexin-A and orexin-B, which are neurotransmitters found primarily in the hypothalamus that promote wakefulness and inhibit rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Loss of these neurotransmitters permits abnormal transition from wakefulness to REM sleep with subsequent development of hallucinations and other features of narcolepsy including cataplexy and sleep paralysis. Diagnosis can be made in patients with daytime somnolence and cataplexy or, in cases where cataplexy is not present, with sleep latency testing. Polysomnography is appropriate to support the diagnosis and to rule out similar sleep-related conditions such as sleep apnea. Occasionally patients undergo lumbar puncture to directly measure concentrations of orexin-A in the cerebrospinal fluid, but this is generally not required for the diagnosis. Pharmacotherapy is directed at promoting wakefulness, and methylphenidate is one relatively safe and effective stimulant used to do this.",

This constellation of symptoms is known as Wallenberg syndrome. The left pons (Choice E) contains several cranial nerve nuclei (ie, the vestibular nuclei, facial nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, cochlear nuclei) along with the spinothalamic tract, corticospinal tract, sympathetic fibers, and the middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles. Consequently, lesions of the left pons lead to vertigo, nystagmus, facial paralysis, decreased lacrimation, decreased salivation, taste loss in the anterior tongue, hearing loss, decrease in pain and temperature sensation of the contralateral body, contralateral hemiparesis, ipsilateral limb ataxia, and/or dysmetria. This constellation of symptoms is known as lateral pontine syndrome. Educational Objective: In Weber syndrome, a stroke of the paramedian branches of the posterior cerebral artery affects the cerebral peduncle, which contains the corticospinal tract and neighboring oculomotor nerve. Patients typically present with ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy (eg, diplopia, ptosis, primary gaze palsy, pupillary constriction deficits) and contralateral hemiparesis with an upper motoneuron-pattern of dysfunction Clinical",

Depression is a common complication of Parkinson disease. Since this patient's depression began after his Parkinson disease diagnosis, his depression is likely a result of Parkinson disease and should be diagnosed as depressive disorder caused by another medical condition. Many patients with this diagnosis improve once the medical condition resolves. Since Parkinson disease does not remit, the depression should be treated pharmacologically. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are first-line medications for patients with major depressive disorder and are frequent ly utilized for patients with comorbid Parkinson disease and major depressive disorder because of their effectiveness and low risk for adverse effects. However, serotonergic medications are not effective for smoking cessation. Bupropion is an antidepressant medication that increases the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine (which targets depressive symptoms) and antagonizes the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (which targets tobacco use). Bupropion can increase blood pressure, so this patient with a history of hypertension should have his blood pressure monitored closely.",

Major depressive disorder (Choice B) is diagnosed when patients meet criteria established in the DSM-5 including impaired sleep (either insomnia or hypersomnolence), loss of interest, guilt, loss of energy, poor concentration, poor appetite, psychomotor retardation, or suicidal ideation. This patient does not meet the criteria. Multi-infarct (vascular) dementia (Choice C) presents frequently with a stepwise decline in cognitive performance over several years and occurs as a result of cumulative damage from many small ischemic strokes. It does not present with hallucinations. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (Choice D) classically presents with enlarged ventricles on imaging with normal opening pressure on lumbar puncture, dementia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence. Progression of Parkinson disease (Choice E) is a possibility in this patient as evidenced by her worsening bradykinesia, but this is less likely to be the cause of her hallucinations than the time-correla ted effect of increasing the doses of medications with known hallucinogenic adverse effects."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning occurs as a consequence of inhaling the gas, often because of its generation in an area of poor ventilation (eg, a garage with door shut and car running, a space heater in a poorly-ventilated room, a malfunctioning basement furnace). CO is a byproduct of combustion. When inhaled, it avidly crosses the pulmonary capillary membrane and tightly binds hemoglobin, inducing a conformationa l change in the molecule and preventing the binding of oxygen. CO has an affinity for hemoglobin that is hundreds of times greater than that of oxygen, readily displacing oxygen from heme. CO also has affinity with the mitochondrial electron transport chain, thus, in addition to hypoxemia resulting from interference with oxygen carrying capacity, cells may not be able to make use of the oxygen that they do receive via aerobic metabolism. As a result, anaerobic metabolism dominates, and lactic acidosis caused by hypoxia ensues. Symptoms of CO poisoning include headache, loss of consciousness, dizziness, vomiting, and fatigue; in severe cases, seizures, dysrhythmias, coma, and death may occur. Examination may show red skin. Treatment for CO poisoning begins with the administration of 100% oxygen regardless of pulse oximetry readings, and if any neurologic symptoms or signs of end-organ dysfunction are present, as in this case, hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be indicated.",

Anticholinergic toxicity is characterized by pupillary dilation, dry mouth, tachycardia, and urinary retention. Vitamin B (thiamine) (Choice E) is used to treat thiamine deficiency such as beriberi or Wernicke encephalopathy. Dry beriberi 1 presents as peripheral neuropathy with mental status change. Wet beriberi exhibits a dilated cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure. Wernicke encephalopathy classically presents as confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Toxop/asma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite. Transmission can occur through the ingestion of oocysts from cat feces or infected meat, direct transmission between a mother and fetus, or from organ transplantation, which leads to invasion followed by dissemination of the parasite where it typically lies dormant. It is a ubiquitous organism and nearly 10% of individuals will be seropositive for T gondii, but the parasite does not usually cause severe disease in immunocompetent individuals. In patients with HIV infection and CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/mm 3, however, reactivation can occur with several distinct clinical syndromes of which cerebral toxoplasmosis results in the most morbidity. Cerebral toxoplasmosis typically presents with multiple ring enhancing lesions scattered throughout the brain. Seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and systemic symptoms are common, as are signs of increased intracranial pressure. Patients with HIV infection and positive Toxop/asma lgG antibodies are typically treated empirically with a sulfonamide and pyrimethamine if cerebral toxoplasmosis is suspected, but confirmatory diagnosis occurs through a brain biopsy, which will show a dense infiltrate of lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells, along with the presence of the T gondii organism.

Focal neurologic deficits and mass lesions on neuroimaging are rare.",
        "B": "Cysticercosis is caused by Taenia so/ium and presents with headache, seizures, and increased intracranial pressure. Neuroimaging will show cystic, ring-enhancing, calcified lesions in the brain parenchyma, meninges, ventricles, spinal cord, and/or orbit. It less commonly presents with focal neurologic deficits such as those seen in this patient. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (Choice C) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs in immunocomp romised patients and presents with focal neurologic deficits, vision changes, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and increased intracranial pressure. It appears similar to toxoplasmosis on neuroimaging but is much less common than toxoplasmos is. If this patient failed to improve with pyrimethamine and sulfonamide therapy, central nervous system lymphoma would be the likely diagnosis. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (Choice D) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by human polyomavirus 2 (formerly JC virus), most commonly in immunocompromised patients. It presents subacutely with altered mental status, ataxia, vision changes, and hemiparesis.

It is generally caused by vertebral bony metastases that tend to occur in the vertebral body, particularly of the thoracic spine. Its presentation depends on the level of the lesion and the degree of spinal cord compression. Symptoms include back pain, which is often worse at night or with lying down, muscle weakness, sensory abnormalities, bladder or bowel dysfunction, and gait instability. It will generally present with an upper motoneuron pattern of injury in the lower extremities with hyperreflexia and positive Babinski signs, as in this patient, assuming the compression is in the thoracic or upper lumbar region. Ascending numbness or paresthesias are also common. Diagnosis is classically made utilizing MRI of the spine.

Guillain-Barre syndrome (Choice B) is caused by autoimmune-mediated nerve destruction following a systemic infection, such as Campy/obacter jejuni. It classically presents with ascending paralysis with absent deep tendon reflexes that begins in the lower extremities. It can also ascend to involve the upper extremities, diaphragm, and cranial nerves in some patients.",

Generally, it presents with symmetric proximal muscle weakness in response to genetic metabolic abnormalities, toxins (eg, alcohol or medications), endocrine dysfunction (eg, hypothyroidism), or inflammation. It does not present with sensory changes. Paraneoplastic neuropathy (Choice E) is an immune-mediated destruction of neuronal tissue in the presence of an underlying malignancy. It can present in a variety of ways, such as an acute sensorimotor radiculopathy, chronic sensorimotor neuropathy, or autonomic neuropathy.

In immunocompetent patients, neuroimaging will most commonly show a solitary, hypodense periventricular mass with well defined borders and mild surrounding edema. In immunocompromised patients, however, the development of primary CNS lymphoma is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, with additional risk factors in HIV including a decreased CD4+ T lymphocyte count, increased viral load, and chronic co-infection with hepatitis B or C virus. Imaging in immunocompromised patients more commonly shows multifocal disease, numerous, ring- or heterogeneously enhancing lesions throughout the corpus callosum, periventricular areas, and periependyma l regions.

These are typically microabscesses that can lead to the development of encephalopathy with altered mental status and are seen on MRI as small, ring-enhancing lesions often with a hemorrhagic component. However, these patients commonly present with fever, nuchal rigidity, and headache, which this patient does not demonstrate Exam Section : Item 37 of 50 Clinical Central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma is a rare variant of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs most commonly in immunocompromised patients. It can occur in the brain, spinal cord, leptomeninges, or eyes. Presenting symptoms include focal neurologic deficits, vision changes, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, headache, nausea, emesis). In immunocompetent patients, neuroimaging will most commonly show a solitary, hypodense periventricular mass with well defined borders and mild surrounding edema. In immunocompromised patients, however, the development of primary CNS lymphoma is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, with additional risk factors in HIV including a decreased CD4+ T lymphocyte count, increased viral load, and chronic co-infection with hepatitis B or C virus. Imaging in immunocompromised patients more commonly shows multifocal disease, numerous, ring- or heterogeneously enhancing lesions throughout the corpus callosum, periventricular areas, and periependyma l regions. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow cytometry or cytology, with evidence of EBV DNA in the CSF supporting the diagnosis. Treatment typically consists of high-dose and generally intrathecal chemotherapeutics and antiretroviral therapy. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, E, and F. Candida! abscesses (Choice A) of the brain can occur in immunocompromised patients. These are typically microabscesses that can lead to the development of encephalopathy with altered mental status and are seen on MRI as small, ring-enhancing lesions often with a hemorrhagic component. However, these patients commonly present with fever, nuchal rigidity, and headache, which this patient does not demonstrate. Cryptococcal meningitis (Choice C) presents subacutely with fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, and photophobia, as well as encephalopathy in severe cases. It is most common in immunocompromised patients. Neuroimaging typically shows no abnormalities, and the diagnosis is made with serum cryptococcal antigen and CSF evaluation. Listeria! meningoencephalitis (Choice D) occurs in patients at the extremes of age (neonates, elderly) and in those that are immunocompromised. It classically presents with fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, altered mental status, cranial nerve palsies, and focal neurologic deficits. While Listeria monocytogenes can cause brain abscesses, this is exceedingly rare. Nocardial abscesses (Choice E) can occur in immunocompromised patients. They classically present with fever, headache, signs of meningeal irritation, and focal neurologic deficits. It more commonly occurs in a concurrent pulmonary infection, which is associated with fever, weight loss, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Toxoplasma encephalitis (Choice F) commonly presents with headache, fever, and neurologic deficits, as well as altered mental status. Toxoplasma lesions appear as ring-enhancing lesions on brain MRI, similar to CNS lymphoma. However, toxoplasma encephalitis would be expected to improve with sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine."

A) Brachiocephalic B) Common carotid C) External carotid D) Internal carotid E) Middle cerebral F) Subclavian G) Vertebral Correct Answer: G. This patient likely has an occlusion of the vertebral artery leading to vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency can be caused by ischemia in patients with poor sympathetic regulation or thromboembolism commonly originating from an atherosclerotic plaque in or dissection of a vertebral artery (known as a posterior circulation stroke). Risk factors for posterior circulation strokes include smoking, hypertension, age, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and peripheral artery disease (as evidenced by this patient's diminished lower extremity pulses). The brain stem, cerebellum, and occipital lobes are commonly affected. Patients typically present with vestibulocerebel lar signs (eg, ataxia, dysmetria, dizziness, imbalance, vertigo, vomiting, nystagmus), ipsilateral cranial nerve dysfunction (eg, dysphagia, dysarthria, vertical or horizontal gaze palsies), contralatera l hemiparesis (caused by corticospinal tract damage), contralateral impairment in pain and temperature sensation (caused by spinothalamic tract damage), and/or contralateral homonymous hemianopsia with macular sparing (caused by posterior cerebral artery involvement). Unlike hemispheric strokes arising from the internal carotid arteries, cortical deficits such as cognitive and speech impairment are typically absent. A noncontrast CT scan of the head rules out hemorrhage, and the diagnosis may be confirmed with vessel imaging if the lesion is sufficiently large. If no hemorrhage is seen, acute management of posterior circulation strokes may involve tissue plasminogen activator therapy or thrombectomy. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, E, and F.

The brachiocephalic artery (Choice A) supplies the arm, head, and neck. Atherosclerotic disease and consequent occlusion of the brachiocephalic artery may lead to neck and upper extremity pain in addition to signs of vertebrobasilar insufficiency that are exacerbated on exercise. Common carotid artery (Choice B) occlusion from atherosclerotic disease less frequently causes symptoms because of retrograde collateral flow through the external carotid artery. If a stroke were to occur, it would affect the ipsilateral anterior and middle cerebral arterial territory, which would not result in signs of vertebrobasilar insufficiency. External carotid artery (Choice C) occlusion from atherosclerotic disease typically does not produce symptoms but may lead to an ocular ischemic syndrome. The internal carotid artery (Choice D) supplies the middle cerebral artery (Choice E), which supplies the lateral frontal and anterolateral parietal lobes. During acute occlusion of the internal carotid artery (typically as a result of a thrombus induced by atherosclerotic disease) or middle cerebral artery (typically related to an embolus from the internal carotid artery), patients may present with hemiparesis and hemisensory deficit (predominantly of the contralateral face and upper body), along with speech impairment. The subclavian artery (Choice F) supplies the upper extremity and gives rise to the vertebral artery. Atherosclerotic disease and occlusion of the subclavian artery usually presents with upper extremity fatigability, claudication, and/or rest pain along with symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency that are exacerbated by exercise.

Atherosclerotic disease and consequent occlusion of the brachiocephalic artery may lead to neck and upper extremity pain in addition to signs of vertebrobasilar insufficiency that are exacerbated on exercise Clinical Correct Answer: G. This patient likely has an occlusion of the vertebral artery leading to vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency can be caused by ischemia in patients with poor sympathetic regulation or thromboembolism commonly originating from an atherosclerotic plaque in or dissection of a vertebral artery (known as a posterior circulation stroke). Risk factors for posterior circulation strokes include smoking, hypertension, age, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and peripheral artery disease (as evidenced by this patient's diminished lower extremity pulses). The brain stem, cerebellum, and occipital lobes are commonly affected. Patients typically present with vestibulocerebel lar signs (eg, ataxia, dysmetria, dizziness, imbalance, vertigo, vomiting, nystagmus), ipsilateral cranial nerve dysfunction (eg, dysphagia, dysarthria, vertical or horizontal gaze palsies), contralateral hemiparesis (caused by corticospina l tract damage), contralateral impairment in pain and temperature sensation (caused by spinothalamic tract damage), and/or contralateral homonymous hemianopsia with macular sparing (caused by posterior cerebral artery involvement). Unlike hemispheric strokes arising from the internal carotid arteries, cortical deficits such as cognitive and speech impairment are typically absent. A noncontrast CT scan of the head rules out hemorrhage, and the diagnosis may be confirmed with vessel imaging if the lesion is sufficiently large. If no hemorrhage is seen, acute management of posterior circulation strokes may involve tissue plasminogen activator therapy or thrombectomy. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, E, and F. The brachiocephalic artery (Choice A) supplies the arm, head, and neck. Atherosclerotic disease and consequent occlusion of the brachiocephalic artery may lead to neck and upper extremity pain in addition to signs of vertebrobasilar insufficiency that are exacerbated on exercise. Common carotid artery (Choice B) occlusion from atherosclerotic disease less frequently causes symptoms because of retrograde collateral flow through the external carotid artery. If a stroke were to occur, it would affect the ipsilateral anterior and middle cerebral arterial territory, which would not result in signs of vertebrobasilar insufficiency. External carotid artery (Choice C) occlusion from atherosclerotic disease typically does not produce symptoms but may lead to an ocular ischemic syndrome. The internal carotid artery (Choice D) supplies the middle cerebral artery (Choice E), which supplies the lateral frontal and anterolateral parietal lobes. During acute occlusion of the internal carotid artery (typically as a result of a thrombus induced by atherosclerotic disease) or middle cerebral artery (typically related to an embolus from the internal carotid artery), patients may present with hemiparesis and hemisensory deficit (predominantly of the contralateral face and upper body), along with speech impairment. The subclavian artery (Choice F) supplies the upper extremity and gives rise to the vertebral artery. Atherosclerotic disease and occlusion of the subclavian artery usually presents with upper extremity fatigability, claudication, and/or rest pain along with symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency that are exacerbated by exercise. This patient lacks upper extremity symptoms or activity-related variability of symptoms Clinical plaque in or dissection of a vertebral artery (known as a posterior circulation stroke).

Tuberculous meningitis typically presents with nuchal rigidity, fever, and altered mental status, similar to the symptoms seen in bacterial meningitis. However, unlike bacterial meningitis which presents acutely, tuberculous meningitis typically shows a subacute presentation. Presence of cranial nerve palsies is also more likely in tuberculous meningitis than bacterial meningitis. Physical examination may show a positive Kernig or Brudzinski sign, indicative of meningeal irritation. Results of laboratory studies will show nonspecific changes including leukocytosis and mild anemia. A tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay are usually positive, but a negative result is also possible. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation is the initial diagnostic step and will reveal an increased opening pressure, increased white blood cell count with prominent lymphocytes, increased protein concentration, and decreased glucose concentration. Culture of the CSF for acid-fast bacilli may be positive, though the sensitivity of this test for tuberculous meningitis is less than 50%.

Neurologically impaired patients should not be assumed to lack decisional capacity to make decisions about their care. The medical team should evaluate the decisiona l capacity of this patient who is making decisions about his end-of-life care. This patient is able to communicate a consistent decision and demonstrate an appreciation of the consequences of his decision, and therefore, he appears to possess decisiona l capacity to make the decision to withdraw care.

Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. A court order (Choice A) or ethics consult (Choice B) are unnecessary. This patient possesses decisional capacity to make the decision to withdraw care. Court orders and ethical consults may be considered when a patient lacks decisional capacity, refuses needed care, and lacks surrogate decision makers.

It has been shown to interact with other medications and caution should be exercised when choosing concomitant medications for treating patients. It is a CYP450 inducer, which may increase hepatic clearance of some medications (eg, warfarin, phenytoin, valproic acid), leading to subtherapeutic concentrations in the serum. Other drugs, such as erythromycin, can interfere with the hepatic metabolism of carbamazepine by inhibiting CYP450 enzymes, leading to decreased carbamazepine clearance, increased serum concentration, and toxicity. Carbamazepine toxicity typically presents with altered mental status, drowsiness, ataxia, nystagmus, nausea, and vomiting. Diagnosis can be made by measuring a serum carbamazepine concentration above therapeutic levels, and there is a dose-dependent effect on neurologic depression. Treatment is supportive, with benzodiazepines for seizures or agitation, and involves discontinuation of offending medications.",

It is most commonly caused by viral-mediated inflammation or immune reaction in the setting of a herpes simplex or herpes zoster infection, although it can also be idiopathic or caused by other viral infections. It presents acutely with unilateral facial paralysis that includes the forehead, consistent with its lower motoneuron pathologic involvement. It can also be associated with loss of taste on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and decreased lacrimation. Symptoms typically peak around 3 weeks, with slow recovery beginning within 6 months. Diagnosis is most commonly based on clinical symptoms, but electrodiagnostic tests, such as EMG, and imaging of the face and head can be utilized if the diagnosis is unclear. Initial treatment consists of oral glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, and antiviral therapy in severe cases.",

MRI of the brain (Choice B) is useful in the evaluation of stroke, especially early in the course of the disease, before it may be evident on CT scan. This patient's symptoms are not consistent with stroke. Doxycycline therapy (Choice C) can be used in the treatment of Lyme disease, which may present with Bell palsy in disseminated Lyme disease. Lyme disease also typically presents with erythema migrans, fatigue, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, and lymphadenopathy, as well as myocarditis, abnormal liver function tests, and kidney injury. This patient has no other signs or symptoms to suggest Lyme disease. Lumbar puncture (Choice E) is used in the evaluation of central nervous system infections, such as bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis.

Positional oculovestibular testing, such as the Dix-Hallpike test, allows the examiner to reproduce the patient's symptoms by repositioning the otolith.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an inflammatory condition in which aching and stiffness develop in the shoulders, hip, and neck. The most common risk factors are age (older than 50 years) and being female. It is also frequently associated with giant cell, or temporal arteritis, which presents with unilateral headache and vision loss, if untreated. Other inflammatory signs, such as malaise and fever, are often present, though localized muscle weakness is not typically seen. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates increased inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein, and thrombocytosis. Polymyalgia rheumatica is responsive to glucocorticoids, which are the first-line therapy for the disease. Low-dose prednisone is the treatment of choice.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Bursitis is inflammation of one or more bursae and is manifested by pain and swelling over a single joint. Some examples include the subacromial bursa which can cause pain in the shoulder, the trochanteric bursa which can cause pain over the lateral aspect of the hip, and the olecranon bursa which can cause pain and swelling posterior to the elbow. When inflamed or injured, fluid can collect inside the potential space of the bursa causing swelling, which can be appreciated on examination as a fluctuant, tender, circumscribed mass. Muscle stiffness is not a typical feature.",
        "B": "Dermatomyositis and polymyositis (Choice E) are autoimmune inflammatory myopathies characterized by muscle weakness, rather than stiffness, of the proximal muscles. Dermatomyositis additionally demonstrates cutaneous findings including a light pink- or heliotrope-colored rash on the eyelids and Gottron papules on the dorsal fingers. Unlike PMR, fibromyalgia (Choice C) affects middle-aged women at various anatomica l sites in conjunction with anxiety, stress, and point tenderness. ESR is normal. This patient's limited involvement to the pelvic and hip girdles along with other inflammatory symptoms including generalized weakness, malaise, and fever suggest a diagnosis of PMR over fibromya lgia. Rheumatoid arthritis (Choice F) is a common autoimmune disease characterized by joint destruction, pain, and upregulation of immunomodulatory cytokines. Muscle pain and stiffness are not typical features."

Low-dose prednisone is the treatment of choice Exam Section : Item 10 of 50 Clinical 'f 10. A 57-year-o ld woman comes to the physician because of daily headaches for 8 months. The headaches are localized to the right temple and usually worsen throughout the day. At times, the headaches are exacerbated by chewing. She has a history of migraines but has not had one since menopause 6 years ago. She recently divorced and is under a great deal of stress at work. She has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years. Her temperatu re is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 144/86 mm Hg. Examination shows pain with movement of the jaw and tenderness under the right zygoma tic arch. The nasal mucosa is normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 20 mm/h. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Bacterial meningitis B) Cluster headache C) Migraine D) Sinusitis E) Temporal arteritis F) Temporomandibu lar joint syndrome G) Tension-type headache H) Trigeminal neuralgia Correct Answer: F. The temporomandibu lar joint (TMJ) forms the articulation between the mandibular condyle and the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone. TMJ syndrome occurs because of a combination of structural damage to the TMJ and a variety of neurologic and psychological factors related to pain and stress. Patients usually present with unilatera l, dull, occasionally sharp or stabbing pain near the TMJ or anterior to the auricle that is exacerbated by chewing or jaw clenching. Patients may also experience popping or clicking sensations associated with movement of the jaw and a decreased range of jaw motion. Treatment includes physical therapy, cognitive behavior therapy or biofeedback therapy to treat underlying stress, and pharmacologic therapy including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or tricyclic antidepressants. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, E, G, and H. Bacterial meningitis (Choice A) presents with fever and signs of meningeal irritation (nausea, irritability, confusion, anorexia, headache, and nuchal rigidity). This patient's absence of fever and meningismus renders this diagnosis unlikely.

Migraines (Choice C) are a common cause of headache in adult patients. They may present with visual aura of scintillating scotoma or fortification spectra but are not associated with focal tenderness of the jaw or pain with chewing. Sinusitis (Choice D) may be associated with bilateral, pressure-like, periorbital headaches and nasal congestion. Patients may experience focal tenderness and tenderness to percussion overlying the affected sinus (typically overlying the brow or maxilla) but rarely experience focal jaw tenderness overlying the TMJ. Temporal arteritis (Choice E), also known as giant cell arteritis, is a vasculitis of medium and large vessels in elderly patients and commonly presents with systemic symptoms, headache, jaw claudication, proximal muscle stiffness, and sudden, irreversible vision loss. This patient's chronic course, lack of associated systemic symptoms, and normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate render this diagnosis less likely. Tension-type headache (Choice G) typically presents with bilateral dull, pressure-like or band-like pain across the bilateral frontal and temporal areas. It does not tend to present with focal tenderness of the jaw or pain with chewing. Trigeminal neuralgia (Choice H), also known as tic douloureux, presents with brief, recurrent, sudden episodes of pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. This is typically triggered by minor stimulation to the affected area, such as light touch, cold air, talking, or brushing one's teeth.

Atrial fibrillation is a major independent risk factor for strokes, and stroke prevention is an essential aspect of management. The loss of coordinated atrial contraction in this dysrhythmia results in blood stasis within the atrial compartment and promotion of thrombus formation. Embolism to the cerebral arteries results in ischemic stroke. The presence of right-sided hemiplegia and expressive dysphasia are suggestive of a lesion involving the left middle cerebral artery distribution. The middle cerebral arteries are the most common cerebral arteries involved in acute thromboembolic stroke.",

A 77-year-old man is brought to the physician by his daughter because he has become increasingly forgetful during the past 6 months. His daughter states that his short-term memory is quite impaired, and he says that he is frustrated with his memory. He lives alone and is able to perform activities of daily living independently. On questioning, he reports a 1-month history of a mild nonproductive cough, constipation, mild pain in his hips with movement, mild numbness of the toes of both feet, and a few episodes of urinary incontinence. He has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and aspirin. His wife died 6 years ago. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 128/72 mm Hg. Muscle strength is normal. Cranial nerves are intact. Deep tendon reflexes are normal. Sensation to vibration is mildly decreased over the distal lower extremities. Proprioception is intact. His gait is wide based, and he has impaired tandem walking. His Mini-Mental State Examination score is 24/30; he recalls one of three objects after 5 minutes. An MRI of the brain shows slightly enlarged ventricles with minimal cortical atrophy. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Recommendation that the patient move to an assisted living community B) Discontinuation of atorvastatin therapy C) Discontinuation of metformin therapy D) Addition of donepezil therapy E) Addition of paroxetine therapy F) Lumbar puncture ~- Correct Answer: F. The patient is presenting with findings concerning for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), with the characteristic combination of dementia (eg, frontal executive dysfunction), gait instability, and urinary incontinence. NPH refers to a type of communicating (nonobstructive) hydrocephalus in which the ventricles are enlarged, leading to damage of the white matter tracts connecting the frontal lobes and basal ganglia. Signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, papilledema, postural headaches) are typically absent. Many cases of NPH are idiopathic, though some are secondary to a defect in cerebrospinal fluid drainage from the ventricles as a result of scarring or obstruction of the ventricular lining from prior hemorrhage or meningitis. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, although ventriculomegaly on brain imaging is suggestive. The most appropriate next step in management is a lumbar puncture to assess the opening pressure and clinical response to removing cerebrospinal fluid. Placement of a ventricular shunt may be needed for long-term management. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, and E. Recommendation that the patient move to an assisted living community (Choice A) is inappropriate prior to a thorough evaluation for intervenable causes. Recovery of executive function in patients with NPH that has progressed to dementia is uncertain. It may be appropriate to refer to assisted living if the patient continues to decline and is unable to manage activities of daily living. . r ~- - - , r - - - , Clinical Please Walt F) Lumbar puncture Correct Answer: F. The patient is presenting with findings concerning for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), with the characteristic combination of dementia (eg, frontal executive dysfunction), gait instability, and urinary incontinence. NPH refers to a type of communicating (nonobstructive) hydrocepha lus in which the ventricles are enlarged, leading to damage of the white matter tracts connecting the frontal lobes and basal ganglia. Signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, papilledema, postural headaches) are typically absent. Many cases of NPH are idiopathic, though some are secondary to a defect in cerebrospinal fluid drainage from the ventricles as a result of scarring or obstruction of the ventricular lining from prior hemorrhage or meningitis.

Recovery of executive function in patients with NPH that has progressed to dementia is uncertain. It may be appropriate to refer to assisted living if the patient continues to decline and is unable to manage activities of daily living. Discontinuation of atorvastatin therapy (Choice B) and discontinuation of metformin therapy (Choice C) may be considered later in the patient's course depending on the degree of recovery. Medications that confer long-term benefits are often discontinued in patients with progressive dementia or life-limiting conditions to avoid unnecessary side effects and pill burden. Addition of donepezil therapy (Choice D) may be considered in the future if the patient's cognitive symptoms do not improve. The next best initial step in management for this patient is to perform a lumbar puncture and assess his clinical response to the removal of cerebrospinal fluid. Addition of paroxetine therapy (Choice E) would not be indicated currently. Cognitive impairment and memory disturbances may be manifestations of depression, especially in older adults, and patients should be screened for depression as part of the initial evaluation. Initiating an antidepressant would not be appropriate at this time. Educational Objective: The triad of cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence, and gait instability should raise concern for normal pressure hydrocephalus. Initial evaluation should include neuroimaging and a lumbar puncture to assess the patient's opening pressure and clinical response to the removal of cerebrospinal fluid Exam Section : Item 14 of 50 Clinical \"t 14. A previously healthy 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of intermittent pain and tingling that radiates from his right shoulder blade to his right thumb and index finger. These symptoms worsen with coughing and sneezing. There is no history of neck, shoulder, or arm injury. His pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnorma lities. The cranial nerves are intact. Muscle strength is normal in all extremities. Deep te ndon reflexes are 1 + in the right biceps muscle and 2+ elsewhere. Babinski sign is absent. Sensation to pinprick is decreased over the dorsal aspect of the right thumb and index finger. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's symptoms? A) Brachia! plexus compression G) Median nerve compress ion at the wrist B) Central nervous system compression H) Radial nerve compression at the elbow C) Central nervous system demyelination I) Radial nerve compression at the spiral groove D) Central nervous system ischemia J) Ulnar nerve compression at the elbow E) Cervical nerve root compression K) Ulnar nerve compression at the wrist F) Median nerve compress ion at the elbow Correct Answer: E. Cervical nerve root compression explains this patient's symptoms of cervical radiculopathy. Radiculopathy refers to pathology affecting a specific spinal nerve root that leads to weakness, numbness, paresthesias, and pain in the dermatomal and myotomal distribution that correlates to the affected root. C6 radiculopathy will result in pain that radiates from the neck into the arm along with decreased sensation, pain, and/or paresthesia in the lateral forearm and the lateral two digits. Additional ly, C6 radiculopathy causes motor dysfunction of elbow flexion and wrist extension, and a diminished or absent biceps reflex. Radiculopathy symptoms may worsen with activities that increase pressure such as coughing and sneezing. Radiculopathy may be caused by spondylosis (degenerative changes of the spine), disc herniation, infection, tumor, demyelination, or infarction. Dermatomes and myotomes are components of the embryonic somite, a paired segment of paraxial mesoderm. When fully developed, the dermatome is an area of skin whose afferent fibers travel within a single spinal nerve, and myotome is a group of muscles innervated by the efferent fibers from a single spinal nerve. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, and K. Brachia! plexus compression (Choice A) typically presents with weakness, numbness, and/or paresthesias of the majority of the upper extremity. Brachia! plexus compression typical ly affects multiple nerve roots and motor dysfunction typically predominates over sensory dysfunction and pain early in the disease process. Central nervous system (CNS) compression (Choice B), demyelination (Choice C), or ischemia (Choice D) typically affects major central nervous system tracts, leading to sensory, motor, and/or autonomic dysfunction contralateral to the lesion. This patient instead demonstrates deficits that are localized to a single spinal nerve root Exam Section : Item 14 of 50 Clinical Cervical nerve root compression explains this patient's symptoms of cervical radiculopathy.

This patient instead demonstrates deficits that are localized to a single spina l nerve root. Median nerve compression at the elbow (Choice F) typically causes anterior interosseous syndrome, a pure motor neuropathy leading to a decreased ability to pinch the first two digits and form a fist. Median nerve compression at the wrist (Choice G) initially leads to pain and paresthesias in the first three digits and may progress to hand weakness, known as carpal tunnel syndrome. Radial nerve compression at the elbow (Choice H) presents primarily with pain of the elbow and dorsal forearm that may radiate to the dorsum of the fingers. Motor and sensory symptoms are less prominent. Radial nerve compression at the spiral groove (Choice I) results in extensor muscle dysfunction of the elbow, wrist, and fingers. Numbness, pain, and/or paresthesias from the triceps to the fingers may occur. The triceps reflex, not the biceps reflex, would be affected. While ulnar nerve compression at the elbow (Choice J) typically results in numbness and paresthesias of the medial hand and wrist, ulnar nerve compression at the wrist (Choice K) typically leads to weakness of the intrinsic hand muscles and the consequent loss of hand dexterity. Patients may demonstrate a decreased ability to abduct and adduct the digits. Educationa l Objective: Radiculopathy refers to pathology affecting a specific spinal nerve root that leads to weakness, numbness, paresthesias, and pain in the dermatomal and myotomal distribution that correlates to the affected root. C6 radiculopathy will cause decreased sensation, pain, and/or paresthesia in the lateral forearm and the lateral two digits. Additionally, C6 radiculopathy causes motor dysfunction of elbow flexion and wrist extension, along with an absent biceps reflex Clinical \"t 15. A 67-year-old man with hypertension is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after a stroke. Examination shows Horner syndrome and paralysis of the palate on the right. Sensation is decreased to pain over the right side of the face and left side of the body, and sensation is absent to hot and cold over the right face and left side of the body. There is no paralysis of the extremities. Which of the following is the most likely site of infarction? A) Right brachium pontis B) Right lateral medulla C) Right midbrain D) Right temporal lobe E) Right thalamus Correct Answer: B. Lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome is caused by occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, leading to an ischemic stroke of the lateral medulla. Five main structures are affected, which include the nucleus ambiguus, vestibular nuclei, lateral spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, and inferior cerebellar peduncle. Loss of the nucleus ambiguus leads to dysphagia, a decreased gag reflex, and hoarseness. The vestibular nucleus loss causes vomiting, vertigo, and nystagmus. The contralateral body and ipsilateral face will develop decreased pain and temperature sensation from involvement of the lateral spinothalamic tract. Horner syndrome may result if the sympathetic fibers are damaged. Additiona lly, ataxia and dysmetria from the involvement of the cerebellar peduncles will also be present. However, a patient with lateral medullary syndrome may not necessarily demonstrate all of these findings in equal proportion, as in this case. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E. The brachium pontis (Choice A), or middle cerebellar peduncles projecting from the pons, may be affected by ischemic events involving the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Similar to lateral medullary syndrome, symptoms of an infarct involving the brachium pontis include ataxia and dysmetria, which are absent in this case. Infarction of the midbrain (Choice C) occurs when the basilar artery becomes occluded. This would impact the oculomotor and trochlear nerves. This patient does not demonstrate any eye movement impairment. Infarction of the right temporal lobe (Choice D), depending on the side of the patient's dominant hemisphere, may impact regions such as the Wernicke area of speech and Meyer loop of the visual pathway. As well, it may impact the primary auditory cortex, resulting in varying degrees of hearing impairment depending on the extent of infarction.

As well, it may impact the primary auditory cortex, resulting in varying degrees of hearing impairment depending on the extent of infarction. Infarction of the right thalamus (Choice E) may develop from occlusion of one of four different arteries, the tuberothalamic artery, paramedian artery, inferolateral artery, or posterior choroidal artery. Depending on the artery involved, symptoms may range from cognitive behavioral disturbances and memory deficits, to sensorimotor impairment and visual field defects. When the right thalamus is involved, hemineglect is typically also present. Educational Objective: Lateral medullary syndrome is caused by occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Symptoms include a combination of dysphagia, decreased gag reflex, hoarseness, vertigo, nystagmus, decreased pain and temperature sensation on the ipsilateral face and contralatera l body, Horner syndrome, ataxia, and dysmetria. ., Exam Section : Item 16 of 50 Clinical A 5-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents because of a 4-hour history of unsteady gait and two episodes of vomiting. Three weeks ago, she had an upper respiratory tract infection that did not require treatment. There is no history of trauma or evidence of toxic ingestion. She takes no medications. Her temperature is 36. 7°C (98°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg. Examination shows slight horizontal nystagmus. Funduscopic examination shows no abnorma lities. The patient is able to sit without support but is unable to walk without support. Deep tendon reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Re-examination in 24 hours B) Complete blood count C) CT scan of the head D) EEG E) Lumbar puncture Correct Answer: C. The patient is showing signs and symptoms concerning for cerebellar ataxia, including gait disturbance and nystagmus. Other associated findings may include dysarthria, speech abnormalities, impaired coordination, vomiting, and headache. Patients typically do not present with a fever, meningismus, or seizures. Acute cerebellar ataxia usually occurs following an acute febrile illness in children under 6 years of age. In the setting of an acute presentation with neurologic deficits, CT scan of the head is effective to evaluate for acute intracranial hemorrhage, tumor, or hydrocephalus that may require emergent management. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E. Re-examination in 24 hours (Choice A) would not be appropriate, as the patient is showing concerning neurologic findings that should be evaluated urgently. Complete blood count (Choice B) could be helpful in evaluating for infection or anemia, neither of which would be the likely cause of the patient's cerebellar neurologic symptoms. An EEG (Choice D) would be helpful in evaluating seizures, which are typically characterized by involuntary rhythmic movements, lapse of consciousness, a posticta l state, and may be accompanied by tongue biting and/or incontinence. This patient's symptoms are taking place while she is awake, alert, and following commands, making seizures unlikely. A lumbar puncture (Choice E) would be the test of choice to evaluate for meningitis. Meningitis is characterized by fever, neck rigidity, and headache. While meningitis can cause focal neurologic deficits, they are typically cranial nerve abnormalities. In addition, this patient is not showing associated signs of meningitis. r ~, - . r,",

It may be appropriate to refer to assisted living if the patient continues to decline and is unable to manage activities of daily living. . r ~- - - , r - - - , Clinical Please Walt F) Lumbar puncture Correct Answer: F. The patient is presenting with findings concerning for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), with the characteristic combination of dementia (eg, frontal executive dysfunction), gait instability, and urinary incontinence. NPH refers to a type of communicating (nonobstructive) hydrocepha lus in which the ventricles are enlarged, leading to damage of the white matter tracts connecting the frontal lobes and basal ganglia. Signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, papilledema, postural headaches) are typically absent. Many cases of NPH are idiopathic, though some are secondary to a defect in cerebrospinal fluid drainage from the ventricles as a result of scarring or obstruction of the ventricular lining from prior hemorrhage or meningitis. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, although ventriculomegaly on brain imaging is suggestive. The most appropriate next step in management is a lumbar puncture to assess the opening pressure and clinical response to removing cerebrospinal fluid. Placement of a ventricular shunt may be needed for long-term management. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, and E. Recommendation that the patient move to an assisted living community (Choice A) is inappropriate prior to a thorough evaluation for intervenable causes. Recovery of executive function in patients with NPH that has progressed to dementia is uncertain. It may be appropriate to refer to assisted living if the patient continues to decline and is unable to manage activities of daily living. Discontinuation of atorvastatin therapy (Choice B) and discontinuation of metformin therapy (Choice C) may be considered later in the patient's course depending on the degree of recovery. Medications that confer long-term benefits are often discontinued in patients with progressive dementia or life-limiting conditions to avoid unnecessary side effects and pill burden. Addition of donepezil therapy (Choice D) may be considered in the future if the patient's cognitive symptoms do not improve. The next best initial step in management for this patient is to perform a lumbar puncture and assess his clinical response to the removal of cerebrospinal fluid. Addition of paroxetine therapy (Choice E) would not be indicated currently. Cognitive impairment and memory disturbances may be manifestations of depression, especially in older adults, and patients should be screened for depression as part of the initial evaluation. Initiating an antidepressant would not be appropriate at this time."

Radiculopathy refers to pathology affecting a specific spinal nerve root that leads to weakness, numbness, paresthesias, and pain in the dermatomal and myotomal distribution that correlates to the affected root. C6 radiculopathy will result in pain that radiates from the neck into the arm along with decreased sensation, pain, and/or paresthesia in the lateral forearm and the lateral two digits. Additional ly, C6 radiculopathy causes motor dysfunction of elbow flexion and wrist extension, and a diminished or absent biceps reflex. Radiculopathy symptoms may worsen with activities that increase pressure such as coughing and sneezing. Radiculopathy may be caused by spondylosis (degenerative changes of the spine), disc herniation, infection, tumor, demyelination, or infarction. Dermatomes and myotomes are components of the embryonic somite, a paired segment of paraxial mesoderm. When fully developed, the dermatome is an area of skin whose afferent fibers travel within a single spinal nerve, and myotome is a group of muscles innervated by the efferent fibers from a single spinal nerve.",

However, a patient with lateral medullary syndrome may not necessarily demonstrate all of these findings in equal proportion, as in this case. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E. The brachium pontis (Choice A), or middle cerebellar peduncles projecting from the pons, may be affected by ischemic events involving the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Similar to lateral medullary syndrome, symptoms of an infarct involving the brachium pontis include ataxia and dysmetria, which are absent in this case. Infarction of the midbrain (Choice C) occurs when the basilar artery becomes occluded. This would impact the oculomotor and trochlear nerves. This patient does not demonstrate any eye movement impairment. Infarction of the right temporal lobe (Choice D), depending on the side of the patient's dominant hemisphere, may impact regions such as the Wernicke area of speech and Meyer loop of the visual pathway. As well, it may impact the primary auditory cortex, resulting in varying degrees of hearing impairment depending on the extent of infarction. Infarction of the right thalamus (Choice E) may develop from occlusion of one of four different arteries, the tuberothalamic artery, paramedian artery, inferolateral artery, or posterior choroidal artery. Depending on the artery involved, symptoms may range from cognitive behavioral disturbances and memory deficits, to sensorimotor impairment and visual field defects. When the right thalamus is involved, hemineglect is typically also present."

Three weeks ago, she had an upper respiratory tract infection that did not require treatment. There is no history of trauma or evidence of toxic ingestion. She takes no medications. Her temperature is 36. 7°C (98°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg. Examination shows slight horizontal nystagmus. Funduscopic examination shows no abnorma lities. The patient is able to sit without support but is unable to walk without support. Deep tendon reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Re-examination in 24 hours B) Complete blood count C) CT scan of the head D) EEG E) Lumbar puncture Correct Answer: C. The patient is showing signs and symptoms concerning for cerebellar ataxia, including gait disturbance and nystagmus. Other associated findings may include dysarthria, speech abnormalities, impaired coordination, vomiting, and headache. Patients typically do not present with a fever, meningismus, or seizures. Acute cerebellar ataxia usually occurs following an acute febrile illness in children under 6 years of age. In the setting of an acute presentation with neurologic deficits, CT scan of the head is effective to evaluate for acute intracranial hemorrhage, tumor, or hydrocephalus that may require emergent management. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E. Re-examination in 24 hours (Choice A) would not be appropriate, as the patient is showing concerning neurologic findings that should be evaluated urgently. Complete blood count (Choice B) could be helpful in evaluating for infection or anemia, neither of which would be the likely cause of the patient's cerebellar neurologic symptoms. An EEG (Choice D) would be helpful in evaluating seizures, which are typically characterized by involuntary rhythmic movements, lapse of consciousness, a posticta l state, and may be accompanied by tongue biting and/or incontinence. This patient's symptoms are taking place while she is awake, alert, and following commands, making seizures unlikely. A lumbar puncture (Choice E) would be the test of choice to evaluate for meningitis. Meningitis is characterized by fever, neck rigidity, and headache. While meningitis can cause focal neurologic deficits, they are typically cranial nerve abnormalities. In addition, this patient is not showing associated signs of meningitis. r ~, - . r,",

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Craniopharyngioma B) Hypertensive encephalopathy C) Major depressive disorder D) Migraine E) Subdural hematoma F) Temporal arteritis Correct Answer: E. Head trauma, the use of anticoagulants, physical abuse, alcohol use disorder, cerebral atrophy, and malignancy are associated with an increased risk for developing a subdural hematoma (SDH). Elderly patients are at risk for cerebral atrophy, which places traction on dural bridging cortical veins. In this setting, minor trauma such as falls can result in shearing of the veins leading to hemorrhage. In some cases, patients may not report a history of trauma. Patients may present with headaches, vomiting, meningismus, or hemiparesis, or they may manifest upper motoneuron examination findings such as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar reflex (Babinski sign). In some cases, the SDH may be large enough to compress adjacent brain parenchyma; the displacement of the cerebral hemisphere can result in neurologic deficits, altered mental status, seizures, herniation syndromes, and signs of increased intracranial pressure.

Head trauma, the use of anticoagulants, physical abuse, alcohol use disorder, cerebral atrophy, and malignancy are associated with an increased risk for developing a subdural hematoma (SDH). Elderly patients are at risk for cerebral atrophy, which places traction on dural bridging cortical veins. In this setting, minor trauma such as falls can result in shearing of the veins leading to hemorrhage. In some cases, patients may not report a history of trauma. Patients may present with headaches, vomiting, meningismus, or hemiparesis, or they may manifest upper motoneuron examination findings such as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar reflex (Babinski sign). In some cases, the SDH may be large enough to compress adjacent brain parenchyma; the displacement of the cerebral hemisphere can result in neurologic deficits, altered mental status, seizures, herniation syndromes, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. On imaging, SDH appears as a crescent-shaped fluid collection abutting the internal surface of the skull, not bound by suture lines. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, and F. Craniopharyngioma (Choice A) is a rare pituitary mass derived from remnants of the Rathke pouch that may present with bitemporal hemianopsia. It is usually detected in youth. Hypertensive encephalopathy (Choice B) may result from acute and severe increases in blood pressure and may manifest with headache, vomiting, agitation, altered mental status, and seizure. It may progress to obtundation and coma. This patient's blood pressure is mildly increased but not severe enough to cause hypertensive encephalopathy. Major depressive disorder (Choice C) may cause cognitive impairment in older patients, which can improve with antidepressant treatment. It would not cause foca l neurologic deficits or upper motoneuron signs. Migraine (Choice D) is a type of primary headache that usually does not typically cause neurologic deficits and would be unlikely to cause altered mental status or upper motoneuron signs. Temporal arteritis (Choice F) is a common vasculitis of medium and large vessels in elderly patients and commonly presents with systemic symptoms, headache, jaw claudication, proximal muscle stiffness, and sudden, irreversible vision loss. Treatment is with immediate, high-dose corticosteroids. Educational Objective: Elderly patients are at risk for cerebral atrophy, which causes traction on dural bridging cortical veins such that minor trauma can result in venous injury leading to a subdural hematoma Exam Section : Item 19 of 50 Clinical \"t 19. A 67-year-o ld woman is brought to the physician because of progressive imbalance and memory difficulties over the past year. Two years ago, she began to have episodes of sudden imbalance with a tendency to fall backwards. She has developed progressive slowness of thought and movement and has had brief episodes of double vision. Examination shows mildly decreased short-term memory and slowness of verbal responses. Downward gaze and upward gaze are markedly impaired. There is marked rigidity of the neck and mild rigidity of the limbs. The gait is broad based with short shuffling steps, and she easily loses her balance, falling backwards. All movements are performed slowly. A CT scan of the head without contrast shows moderate, diffuse atrophy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Creutzfe ldt-Jakob disease B) Dementia, Alzheimer type C) Hydrocep halus D) Hypothyroidism E) Multi-infarct (vascular) dementia F) Parkinson disease with dementia G) Progressive supranuclear palsy; H) Syphilis I) Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome Correct Answer: G. Progressive supranuclear palsy, an atypical parkinsonian disorder, is a neurodegenerative disease associated with tau-positive neurofibri llary tangles in the basal ganglia, cortex, and brainstem. Patients typically present at an average age of 65 years with gait instability, oculomotor deficits (classically vertical gaze palsy), frontal lobe deficits, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity. The gait pattern varies in step length and base width, though patients typically walk and pivot too quickly (as a result of impulsivity from frontal lobe damage), leading to backward falls. Definitive diagnosis occurs by neuropathologic examination illustrating a pattern of neurofibrillary tangles in the characteristic distribution. Neuroimaging illustrating midbrain and/or cerebral cortex atrophy supports the diagnosis. Death typically occurs 6 to 9 years after disease onset. Management is supportive and includes physical and occupational therapy along with advanced care planning. Incorrect Answer: A, B, C, D, E, F, H, and I. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (Choice A) is a human prion disease that presents with rapidly progressing dementia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, cerebellar dysfunction, corticospinal tract dysfunction, basal ganglia dysfunction, and stimulus-induced myoclonus.

A hypotensive TIA typically lasts until resolution of the low-flow event while an embolic TIA lasts hours, as in this case. An embolic ischemic stroke involves an event in which a clot breaks off and travels to the brain, occluding blood flow within a cerebral artery.

Organophosphates bind to and are inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase, preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine (ACh), which leads to excess concentrations of ACh in the neuromuscular junction. ACh acts on both nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors. Nicotinic ACh receptors are found in autonomic ganglia, adrenal medulla, and skeletal muscle, whereas muscarinic ACh receptors are found in heart, brain, smooth muscle, exocrine glands, and sweat glands. Resultant cholinergic excess leads to bronchospasm, bronchorrhea, bradycardia, diarrhea, lacrimation, and salivation. Because of the potential for organophosphate toxicity via transcutaneous exposure, medical professionals should always wear rubber gloves when treating the patient. Treatment involves decontamination of the patient, along with atropine to antagonize the muscarinic receptors, and 2-pralidoxime to regenerate functional acetylcholinesterase.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder arising in midlife that affects both lower motoneurons arising from the anterior horn and upper motoneurons of the lateral corticospina l tract within the brain and spinal cord. Neurons degenerate as the result of an unknown cause that may involve RNA processing and/or excitotoxicity. Patient presentations are variable, though typically feature a combination of upper motoneuron (eg, increased muscle tone, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign) and lower motoneuron findings (eg, decreased muscle tone, hyporeflexia, early muscle atrophy) in an asymmetric distribution that may include the bulbar muscles. Some patients may experience cognitive or behavioral changes, though other patients are cognitively normal. The diagnosis is primarily clinical but may be supported by electromyographic findings of acute and chronic denervation. ALS is a progressive disease with death usually occurring within 3 to 5 years of diagnosis, most commonly secondary to neuromuscular respiratory failure. This patient's dyspnea with lying supine is most likely secondary to diaphragmatic paralysis caused by his ALS. Symptoms of diaphragmatic paralysis worsen in the supine position, as gravity no longer assists in contracting and moving the diaphragm downward.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Bronchospasm occurs most commonly in the setting of reactive airway disease, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It typically presents with shortness of breath and wheezing on auscultation that is not position-dependent. While this patient may have some degree of reactive airway disease secondary to his significant smoking history, his symptoms are more consistent with diaphragmatic paralysis. Failure of the intercostal muscles (Choice C) may also occur in the late stages of ALS or in other neuromuscular diseases. lntercostal muscle weakness can lead to dyspnea, given their role in chest expansion, but this shortness of breath would not be dependent on positioning. Left ventricular failure (Choice D) can cause shortness of breath secondary to pulmonary edema and is commonly associated with lower extremity edema, weight gain, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, rales on lung auscultation, and increased jugular venous pressure. This patient has no signs of heart failure, and his shortness of breath with lying supine is more consistent with diaphragmatic paralysis. Panacinar emphysema (Choice E) more commonly presents with exertional dyspnea, chronic cough, and sputum production. Dyspnea is not typically exacerbated in the supine position. Pleural effusions (Choice F) can potentially cause dyspnea with supine positioning and are common in congestive heart failure. However, they would be associated with diminished breath sounds on auscultation, not rhonchi as in this patient."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cerebral infarctions, also known as strokes, occur as a result of ischemic or hemorrhagic loss of blood supply to the brain. Approximately 80% to 85% of strokes are ischemic, commonly arising from thromboembolic disease (eg, middle cerebral artery occlusion from a thrombus), whereas 15% to 20% of strokes are hemorrhagic as a result of blood vessel rupture (eg, hypertension related intraparenchymal hemorrhage from a perforating artery). Risk factors for stroke include smoking, hypertension, diabetes, carotid or intracrania l atherosclerotic disease, history of hypercoagulability, atrial fibrillation, and advanced age. Classically, strokes manifest as a neurologic deficit related to the affected part of the brain. Infarction in the distribution of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery affects several cranial nerve nuclei within the pons, which together are referred to as the lateral pontine syndrome. Involvement of the facial nucleus leads to facial droop caused by muscle paralysis, decreased lacrimation, decreased salivation, and decreased taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Involvement of the vestibular nucleus causes vomiting, vertigo, and nystagmus. Involvement of the middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles will lead to ataxia and dysmetria. lpsilatera l Horner syndrome and contralateral pain and temperature sensation impairment, though not present in this patient, may also result.",

Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused by reactivation of a latent infection with herpes zoster virus within the geniculate ganglion. Viral reactivation within the geniculate ganglion leads to facial nerve palsy, which causes paralysis of the muscles of facial expression (including the forehead) and may cause lagophthalmos and corneal dryness. In addition, the proximity of the vestibulocochlear nerve to the geniculate ganglion increases the risk for its involvement, which causes a characteristic presentation of ear pain and vesicular rash of the external ear canal or auricle, and may also cause hearing loss, vertigo, and nystagmus. The diagnosis is clinical but may be confirmed with PCR amplification testing. Treatment includes oral prednisone and acyclovir.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Fluphenazine, a first-generation antipsychotic medication, is a dopamine-2 (D ) receptor antagonist. By decreasing mesolimbic 2 dopamine signaling, fluphenazine treats the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. D antagonism in the basal ganglia can cause acute 2 dystonic reactions and parkinsonism, leading to this patient's bradykinesia (manifesting as a decreased right arm swing while walking), resting tremor, increased muscle tone, and postural instability (manifesting as a short, or shuffling, gait). The chronic use of antidopaminergic agents may also upregulate D receptors in the basal ganglia, leading to tardive dyskinesia. Management of 2 medication-induced parkinsonism typically involves adding an anticholinergic medication such as benztropine, which counteracts antidopaminergic activity and addresses parkinsonism. In this patient with schizophrenia already on an anticholinergic medication (benztropine ), the next step is decreasing or discontinuing the dose of the offending medication and switching to an antipsychotic medication that causes less potent D antagonism. 2",

An increase in cholinergic signaling through adding donepezil or discontinuing benztropine would not address this patient's parkinsonism (and in the case of discontinuing benztropine, would likely exacerbate parkinsonism).",

Patients may be asymptomatic, or they may experience seizures or focal neurologic deficits related to the tumor location. Meningiomas are typically benign but can be malignant. Malignant meningiomas may grow rapidly, leading to symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (postural headache, nausea, papilledema). Meningiomas appear as well-circumscribed, extra-axia l (outside of the brain parenchyma) masses that compress the underlying parenchyma. They demonstrate uniform enhancement on CT imaging. Definitive diagnosis requires histologic examination of the tissue, which will demonstrate spindle cells arranged in a whorled pattern with psammoma bodies.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cerebral infarctions, or strokes, occur as a result of ischemic or hemorrhagic loss of blood supply to the brain. Approximately 80% to 85% of strokes are ischemic, common ly arising from thromboembo lic disease, whereas 15% to 20% of strokes are hemorrhagic because of blood vessel rupture. Risk factors for stroke include smoking, hypertension, diabetes, carotid or intracranial atherosclerotic disease, history of hypercoagulability, atrial fibrillation, and advanced age. Classically, strokes manifest as a neurologic deficit related to the affected part of the brain. Occlusion of the left posterior cerebra l artery (PCA) explains this patient's deficits. The PCA supplies much of the occipita l lobes as well as the inferomedia l temporal lobe, posteromedia l parietal lobe, thalamus, and parts of the brainstem. Occlusion of the left PCA typically leads to right homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing (as a result of damage of the left primary visual cortex). Right homonymous hemianopia likely explains this patient's car accident. Occlusion of the left PCA may also result in right hemisensory deficit (caused by thalamus damage) and right hemiparesis (caused by damage to the cerebral peduncles in the midbrain). As well, damage to the left parietal cortex may occur and lead to agraphia, acalculia, finger agnosia, and left-right disorientation (Gerstmann syndrome).",

Nighttime symptoms are frequently encountered, and the initial treatment requires wrist splints worn at night. Refractory or severe symptoms may be referred for surgical intervention. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, E, G, and H. Immunologic damage to the brachia! (Choice A), median (Choice B), radial (Choice C), or ulnar (Choice D) nerves may occur in neuralgic amyotrophy, also called Parsonage-Turner syndrome, which is thought to be related to immune-mediated damage of the nerves of the brachia! plexus. It most commonly involves the nerves of the upper or middle brachia! plexus but can involve more distal, singular nerves. Patients develop debilitating pain and weakness that gradually improve over months. Mechanical entrapment of the brachia! nerve (Choice E), or the brachia! plexus, can result in several distinct clinical syndromes depending upon the location of entrapment. Lower trunk entrapment can result in myotomal weakness in the distribution of CB to T1 while entrapment of the upper trunk causes weakness in muscles innervated by the CS and C6 nerve roots. Mechanical entrapment of the radial nerve (Choice G) commonly occurs at the spiral groove where the radial nerve wraps posteriorly around the humerus. It results in wrist drop, impaired finger extension, and loss of sensation over the dorsum of the hand and forearm. Mechanical entrapment of the ulnar nerve (Choice H) commonly occurs at the medial epicondyle of the elbow and results in sensory loss of the fourth and fifth digits, with occasional weakness of the interosseous muscles in the hand, resulting in impaired grip strength. Compression can occur at the wrist but is less common."

Intravenous ceftriaxone therapy (Choice A) is used in the treatment of bacterial meningitis, along with vancomycin and, depending on patient age, ampicillin. Bacterial meningitis presents acutely with fever, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status in a toxic-appearing patient, although it can also cause focal neurologic deficits. Intravenous labetalol therapy (Choice B) is used in hypertensive urgency and emergency, which present with increased blood pressures, typically with the systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mm Hg. End-organ damage is characteristic of hypertensive emergency. This patient's blood pressure is near normal and does not require correction with intravenous medication. Intravenous mannitol therapy (Choice C) can be used to decrease cerebral edema in the setting of traumatic brain injury, since it is an osmotic diuretic that draws excess fluid out from tissues and excretes it from the body. It plays less of a role in controlling edema of the spinal cord, and its onset of action is longer than that of methylprednisolone. Oral prednisone therapy (Choice E) is used in rheumatic diseases, allergic reactions, and inflammatory or immune reactions. While it could decrease the spinal cord edema seen in this patient because of its anti-inflammatory properties, its onset of action is longer than methylprednisolone. Surgical exploration of the cervical spine (Choice F) is typically performed in the setting of an unstable vertebral fracture or dislocation. It may be necessary in this case; however, glucocorticoids can be administered immediately to begin temporizing the effect of the lesion."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an uncommon neurologic condition that affects neuromuscu lar junction transmission. Normally, action potentials lead to depolarization in the terminal bouton of the axon. Voltage-gated calcium channels consequently open and allow calcium influx, which triggers the exocytosis of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles into the synaptic cleft. Patients with LEMS possess antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels on presynaptic lower motoneurons, which decreases calcium influx and the subsequent release of acetylcholine. This patient with a smoking history and proximal muscle weakness, with a known lung nodule, likely has paraneoplastic autoantibody production against voltage-gated calcium channels, causing LEMS in the setting of small cell lung cancer. Patients may also have depressed or absent deep tendon reflexes. The muscle weakness typically improves with exercise as small amounts of acetylcholine accumulate in the synaptic cleft over time, increasing the frequency of postsynaptic action potentials in skeletal muscle cells. This can be seen on nerve conduction studies, as well. Autonomic symptoms such as decreased salivation (and consequent dry mouth) may also occur. The diagnosis may be confirmed with nerve conduction studies and electromyography with exercise testing.

Normally, action potentials lead to depolarization in the terminal bouton of the axon. Voltage-gated calcium channels consequently open and allow calcium influx, which triggers the exocytosis of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles into the synaptic cleft. Patients with LEMS possess antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels on presynaptic lower motoneurons, which decreases calcium influx and the subsequent release of acetylcholine. This patient with a smoking history and proximal muscle weakness, with a known lung nodule, likely has paraneoplastic autoantibody production against voltage-gated calcium channels, causing LEMS in the setting of small cell lung cancer. Patients may also have depressed or absent deep tendon reflexes. The muscle weakness typically improves with exercise as small amounts of acetylcholine accumulate in the synaptic cleft over time, increasing the frequency of postsynaptic action potentials in skeletal muscle cells. This can be seen on nerve conduction studies, as well. Autonomic symptoms such as decreased salivation (and consequent dry mouth) may also occur. The diagnosis may be confirmed with nerve conduction studies and electromyography with exercise testing. In this patient, smoking cessation would have prevented the development of lung cancer and consequent LEMS. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Daily aspirin therapy (Choice B) is used in the prophylaxis and treatment of cardiovascu lar disease, such as coronary artery disease and stroke. It does not play a role in the prevention of lung cancer development. Discontinuing atenolol therapy (Choice C) or atorvastatin therapy (Choice D) would not have prevented this patient from developing lung cancer and subsequent LEMS. While ~-adrenergic blocker therapy can cause fatigue and statin therapy can cause myopathy, neither causes hyporeflexia. More aggressive treatment of high blood pressure (Choice E) is an incorrect choice, as it would not have prevented this patient from developing lung cancer. Additionally, this patient's blood pressure is well-controlled."

        "A": "Local recurrence of the medulloblastoma would cause neurologic deficits specific to the region of the brain being affected by the tumor. While, depending on the location, this could cause lower extremity weakness, it would cause hyperreflexia rather than hyporeflexia because of the involvement of the upper motoneuron. This patient's lower extremity hyporeflexia indicates a peripheral cause affecting the lower motoneuron. Metastatic spread of the cancer hematogenous ly (Choice B) would be more likely to cause foci of malignancy to develop in other or ans includin the bones, liver, or lun s. This is an uncommon com lication of medulloblastoma since extraneural metastases are Clinical Correct Answer: C. Metastatic spread of cancer through cerebrospinal fluid pathways is the mechanism behind this patient's development of cauda equina syndrome. Cauda equina syndrome occurs as a result of compression of the spinal nerve roots comprising the cauda equina. Often, such compression occurs because of malignancy (as in this case), trauma, disc herniation, spinal stenosis, spinal epidural abscess, or spinal epidural or subdural hematoma. Symptoms include lower extremity numbness, weakness, paralysis, hyporeflexia, perinea! anesthesia, fecal incontinence with poor rectal tone, and overflow incontinence marked by an inability to void with associated urinary retention. Emergent MRI of the lumbosacral spine is indicated to investigate the cause of cauda equina syndrome and to determine the necessity of surgical decompression. Initial treatment for patients with epidural spinal cord compression and neurologic deficits include symptomatic treatment, pain control, and glucocorticoid therapy prior to operative therapy. High-dose glucocorticoid therapy is helpful as a bridge to definitive therapy and may transiently improve neurologic function by decreasing edema at the site of cord compression. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, E, and F. Local recurrence of the medulloblastoma (Choice A) would cause neurologic deficits specific to the region of the brain being affected by the tumor. While, depending on the location, this could cause lower extremity weakness, it would cause hyperreflexia rather than hyporeflexia because of the involvement of the upper motoneuron. This patient's lower extremity hyporeflexia indicates a peripheral cause affecting the lower motoneuron. Metastatic spread of the cancer hematogenously (Choice B) would be more likely to cause foci of malignancy to develop in other organs including the bones, liver, or lungs. This is an uncommon complication of medulloblastoma since extraneural metastases are rare with this particular tumor. Radiation necrosis of the brain stem (Choice D) would cause symptoms of midbrain, pons, and medulla infarcts. The cranial nerve nuclei along with ascending and descending spinal tracts would be affected. Symptoms would include impaired cranial nerve function and decreased sensorimotor function of the ipsilateral face and contralateral body. Lower extremity weakness would be accompanied by hyperreflexia, not hyporeflexia, because of the involvement of the upper motoneurons. Thrombosis of the anterior spinal artery (Choice E) causes dysfunction of the anterior tracts within the spinal cord including the corticospinal tract (loss of motor function), spinothalamic tract (loss of pain and temperature sensation), and anterior horns. Thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus (Choice F) is rare because of the large size of this sinus. However, when it does occur, thrombosis in this area results in severe headaches followed by the potential for altered mental status, bilateral neurologic deficits, and seizures. This patient's findings are more consistent with cauda equina syndrome secondary to metastatic spread of cancer."

Common manifestations include episodes of optic neuritis, which manifests as vision loss and pain, and transverse myelitis, which can affect any level of the spinal cord.

Treatment is with high-dose intravenous steroids and, occasionally, plasma exchange for acute attacks. Prophylaxis with eculizumab or other biologic agents is warranted at the time of diagnosis. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E. Abnormal echocardiography (Choice A) is seen in patients with strokes secondary to septic emboli from endocarditis, but this patient does not have any evidence of endocarditis, and strokes typically present with unilateral symptoms as opposed to bilateral symptoms, which is more consistent with a spinal cord syndrome. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in the serum (Choice B) are a feature of many rheumatologic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus. There is also a portion of the population that has positive ANA titers and no identifiable disease; thus, this is a nonspecific finding. Decreased peripheral nerve conduction velocities (Choice D) are characteristic of peripheral neuropathy, which usually manifests with sensory changes or weakness of the extremities in a stocking-g love distribution. NMO is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS), and this patient's findings of positive Babinski tests and hyperreflexia are consistent with a central pathology. Decreased serum copper concentration (Choice E) is not a feature of NMO. Increased copper concentration is seen in Wilson disease, which can present with psychosis, Kayser-Fleischer rings, and cirrhosis."
