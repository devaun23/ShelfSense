Rapid electrical depolarization of the heart and resultant increased heart rate impairs diastolic filling time resulting in low cardiac output leading to hypotension. Such a condition is accompanied by the high likelihood of degeneration to ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. Any patient with an unstable, wide-complex tachycardia requires immediate synchronized cardioversion to abort the rhythm and permit improved cardiac output. Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocols are well-established for such cases; unstable patients (hypotensive, diaphoretic, tachypneic, with altered mental status) should be immediately cardioverted. Stable, perfusing wide-complex arrhythmias (normotensive, minimally symptomatic, with easily palpable pulses) can be treated with antiarrhythmic medication.

The tearing of the tunica intima and media in dissection allows for the creation of a false lumen in which blood can accumulate. Further, branch vessels can become occluded by the false lumen leading to end-organ ischemia. In older patients with a history of hypertension, atherosclerotic disease of the vasa vasorum plus breakdown of normal mural collagen and elastin results in accumulation of basophilic ground substance in place of normal tissue architecture. This process is known as cystic medial necrosis of the aorta. This process occurs predominantly in the tunica media - the smooth muscle layer of the arterial wall - and results in progressive weakening that can lead to an increased risk for thoracic aortic aneurysm formation and aortic dissection.",

Oxygen delivery is a function of cardiac output and oxygen content. If oxygen content falls, cardiac output must rise to maintain equivalent delivery.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (OKA) occurs due to the accumulation of serum ketones such as ~-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone in the setting of deficient insulin signaling. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs because of the relative state of starvation created through absent insulin signaling. Patients present with fatigue, polyuria, shortness of breath, and diffuse abdominal discomfort. Vital signs may show tachycardia and tachypnea. Kussmaul respirations, rapid and deep, is a classic physical exam finding because of respiratory compensation for the underlying metabolic acidosis . Labs typically show increased glucose, ketones, and a high anion-gap because of the accumulation of unmeasured anions in serum . Anion gap is calculated as the difference between sodium and the sum of bicarbonate and chloride anions. Treatment is through replacement of insulin, volume repletion, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions. lncorrectAnswers: B, C, D, and E. Accumulation of lactate (Choice B), also known as lactic acidosis, can occur in multiple different situations such as shock, metabolic derangements, and in response to medications. It can also occur in OKA; however, it is not the primary cause of acidosis . Decreased renal production of ammonium (Choice C) and loss of bicarbonate through the kidneys (Choice D) are both causes of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). RTAs are not caused by the accumulation of an unmeasured anion and do not present with an increased anion gap. Movement of potassium into the cells (Choice E) occurs because of transcellular potassium-proton exchange . Increased movement of potassium into the cells occurs when the serum is alkalotic, not acidotic. Acidosis in the setting of OKA stimulates movement of potassium out of the cells into the serum. ,. \"' , r-- r ,,,",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Dizziness and gait instability carry a broad differential diagnosis; these symptoms are often divided into central, peripheral, and secondary causes of symptoms to determine a likely diagnosis. Central causes include cerebrovascular accidents such as ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, tumors of the brain stem and cerebellum, infarction involving the vestibulocochlear nerve, and multiple sclerosis or similar demyelinating disorders. Peripheral causes include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, labyrinthitis, Meniere disease, endolymphatic fistula, or temporal bone fractures, tumors, or lesions. Secondary or systemic causes can include electrolyte imbalances, hypovolemia, cardiac arrhythmia, infections, and vitamin deficiencies, among other causes. Labyrinthitis is inflammation of the inner ear, often involving the vestibulocochlear nerve, and is often preceded by an upper respiratory or ear infection. Classic symptoms include vertigo, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hearing loss. Treatment is supportive, along with the exclusion of emergent causes of vertigo and ataxia, as the condition is typically self-limited. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) (Choice A) is a known cause of central vertigo secondary to impingement of the vestibulocochlear nerve at the brain stem. These tumors often occur at the cerebellopontine angle and are often subclinical; there is an association with neurofibromatosis, and they may present with hearing loss, vertigo, and nystagmus. Preceding infection or dulling of the tympanic membranes would not be expected. Cerebral infarction (Choice B) can cause vertigo by disrupting normal neurologic equilibrium and proprioceptive pathways, especially when such infarction involves the cerebellum, pons, or brain stem nuclei involving the oculomotor, trochlear, abducens, or vestibulocochlear nerves. Nystagmus, motor or sensory neurologic deficits, and cranial nerve deficits would be expected in such cases, and the presentation is typically acute. Signs of vertebrobasilar insufficiency, such as nausea, vomiting, dysarthria, and impaired brain stem reflexes may also be present. Dehydration (Choice C) may present with dizziness or ataxia in the setting of orthostatic hypotension, with patients often describing feelings of light-headedness when rising from supine to seated or seated to standing. It is caused by decreased cardiac output from diminished preload and resolves with volume resuscitation. Endocarditis (Choice D) presents with acute or subacute fever, a new or changing heart murmur, septic emboli to the lung or systemic circulation, and vascular and immunologic phenomena such as Roth spots, Osler nodes, Janeway lesions, and splinter hemorrhages. Multiple sclerosis (MS) (Choice F) presents with neurologic symptoms of varying duration separated in space and time. Common symptoms include optic neuritis, which is often the declaring presentation. Women are more commonly affected than men. Any type of neurologic symptom may occur. MS would not be expected to follow an infection though it may be exacerbated by such, and physical exam findings of tympanic membrane dullness (suggestive of inflammation and fluid in the middle ear) would not be present. r-- r \" , r ,",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Shortness of breath, edema, jugular venous distention (JVD), crackles in dependent areas of lung, a history of poorly controlled hypertension, tachypnea, tachycardia, and an x-ray showing cardiomegaly with cephalization of vessels raises suspicion for cardiogenic pulmonary edema because of increased pressures in the left side of the heart, pulmonary veins, and pulmonary capillaries. Pulmonary edema can also occur from non-cardiogenic sources (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome, multifocal pneumonia, burns/inhalation injuries, high altitude, and drowning). Because of increased left-heart filling pressures in heart failure, the pulmonary venous pressure rises, which in turn results in increased pressures in pulmonary capillaries. This increased hydrostatic pressure results in interstitial edema and eventually alveolar edema. This is seen clinically as shortness of breath and respiratory distress and is supported by signs of hypervolemia such as peripheral edema, JVD, S gallop, and crackles on lung examination. Vital signs typically show tachycardia, 3 hypertension, tachypnea, and hypoxia. Treatment is through diuresis to reduce the patient's hypervolemic state and lower cardiac filling pressure, pulmonary venous, and pulmonary capillary pressure. Nitroglycerin, a venodilator, can also be utilized to shift fluid into capacitance vessels and lower preload. Positive pressure ventilation can also reduce alveolar and interstitial edema and drive fluid back into circulation. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. Aspiration pneumonia (Choice A) presents as shortness of breath, cough productive of sputum, and fever, with a focal consolidation on chest x-ray, often in the superior segment of the inferior right lobe of lung. This is the most common location for an aspiration event to occur when a patient is supine. An aspiration event must be in the history to diagnose aspiration pneumonia; thus, the patient will often have a history of swallowing dysfunction, stroke, oropharyngeal or laryngeal malignancy, or a condition that causes frequent vomiting and retching such as alcoholism or bulimia. Bronchiectasis (Choice B) presents with signs of obstructive lung disease, and often follows chronic pulmonary necrotizing infections, which can occur in the setting of cystic fibrosis, Kartagener syndrome, or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Patients will present with wheezing and mucus plugging, and, unless concomitant right heart failure is present, would not necessarily present with signs of hypervolemia (e.g., edema, JVD). Cephalization of vessels would also be atypical, unless left heart failure were also present. Chest x-ray often shows marked bronchial dilatation and wall thickening. Chronic bronchitis (Choice C) presents with chronic productive cough and signs of obstructive lung disease (e.g., wheezing, air trapping). It often occurs in smokers as a component of the spectrum of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in tandem with emphysema. This commonly results in right heart failure from chronic hypoxemic pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction. This would potentially manifest with JVD, ascites, and lower extremity edema, less likely pulmonary edema. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (Choice D) is caused by an exaggerated immune response (typically type 3 or type 4 hypersensitivity) to an inhaled antigen. It can present in acute, subacute, or chronic forms, with the acute form characterized by shortness of breath, cough, and systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, and rash, following exposure to an antigen. The chest x-ray may be normal at this stage or may show interstitial infiltrates. The subacute and chronic forms commonly present with dyspnea, cough, fatigue, and weight loss, and imaging reveals interstitial inflammation and fibrosis of the lung. Pulmonary function tests generally demonstrate a restrictive pattern. Unless concomitant heart failure were present, signs of volume overload and cephalization of the vessels would be unlikely. Pulmonary embolism (Choice F) is characteristically associated with long periods of immobilization such as orthopaedic surgery, intensive care unit stay, long drives, and long plane flights, because of the association with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) formation from venous stasis. DVT classically presents with unilateral lower extremity edema, and when an embolus travels to the lung, the patient may become symptomatic. Classic symptoms include rapid-onset chest pain and dyspnea; if an infarction has occurred, pleuritic chest pain and hemoptysis may be present. Vital signs are often notable for tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia; hypotension can be present if the em bolus is large enough to obstruct blood flow from the right heart. The lungs are typically clear to auscultation, and cardiomegaly and cephalization of the vessels would be unlikely unless concomitant heart failure were present. r-- r \" , r ,",

Blood may also be detectable in stool from extraintestinal sources, such as swallowed blood during epistaxis. The test for occult blood is also sometimes confounded by oral iron supplementation, which can lead to false positive results. If a lower GI tract source is suspected, a colonoscopy is indicated . This allows visualization, biopsy, excision , or cautery of any suspicious lesions, which can be both diagnostic and therapeutic.

Failure to void following removal of an indwelling urinary catheter raises suspicion for post-catheter urethral inflammation with resultant acute urinary obstruction.

Urinalysis typically reveals eosinophiluria, with occasional WBC casts, increased WBC/hpf, and proteinuria. Treatment involves discontinuing the inciting agent. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, E, and F. Acute tubular necrosis often follows an ischemic or nephrotoxic insult and is commonly seen in patients with cardiac arrest following prolonged resuscitation prior to return of spontaneous circulation and in patients with prolonged cardiogenic, obstructive, distributive, or hypovolemic shock. Nephrotoxic agents such as heavy metals and myoglobin can also precipitate acute tubular necrosis. It is characterized on urinalysis by proteinuria, increased WBC/hpf, muddy brown casts, and visualized tubular epithelial cells on urine microscopy {Choice A). Choice C generally reflects a normal urinalysis, with specific gravity, glucose, protein, white and red cells, and casts all within normal limits. Choice D may reflect pyelonephritis, as WBC casts and bacteria are present. Classically, the number of white cells per high power field along with leukocyte esterase and nitrites are also increased in pyelonephritis. Nephritic syndrome typically presents with red blood cell casts and hematuria {Choice E).

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Pleural effusions are caused by multiple underlying conditions including infection such as pneumonia, malignancy such as lung cancer or mesothelioma, and increased hydrostatic pressure such as left-sided heart failure. They are clinically suspected on exam in the setting of dullness to percussion and diminished breath sounds and can be visualized on imaging including chest x-ray, CT scan, or ultrasound. Analyzing the pleural fluid can reveal an underlying cause to guide therapy. Fluid is inspected for cell counts, organisms, pH, glucose, total protein, and enzyme levels. Low pH and low glucose are indicative of increased cellular metabolism in the fluid and may indicate underlying malignancy and/or infection. Effusions can be further categorized as transudates (eg, serous fluid resulting from imbalanced hydrostatic or oncotic pressure) or exudates (eg, complex fluid resulting from pneumonia, empyema, malignancy, or inflammatory disease) using Light's criteria, which compares the pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels to those found in serum. Pneumonia can be complicated by simple parapneumonic exudative effusions, which, if sufficiently large, can compress lung parenchyma and impair respiratory mechanics. If not treated, secondary infection can occur within the pleural space leading to an empyema which requires evacuation via a chest tube or surgery in addition to continued antibiotic therapy. Empyema is characterized by an exudative effusion with increased pleural fluid leukocytes, low pH, low glucose, increased protein, and increased lactate dehydrogenase.",

If the infarction results in left ventricular dysfunction, patients may experience cardiogenic pulmonary edema resulting in shortness of breath, tachypnea, hypoxia, audible crackles, and an S or S gallop. Diagnosis is made using clinical history, analysis of cardiac biomarkers, and an ECG which may show ST-segment elevation or depression, inverted T-waves, or Q 3 4 waves. Treatment requires the use of antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel) plus anticoagulants (eg, heparin), pain control, and revascularization through angioplasty, thrombolysis, or coronary artery bypass grafting.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Mild forgetfulness without significant impairment in ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living, with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 27/30, is most consistent with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI is often seen prior to a diagnosis of dementia, especially Alzheimer type, and includes amnestic (memory-related) and non-amnestic (language, spatial, executive functional impairment) MCI with generally preserved ability to function independently without significant impairment. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Dementia, Alzheimer type (Choice A) is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - fifth edition (DSM-5) as loss of intellectual function within multiple domains: language, memory, perception, motor skills, attention, orientation, problem solving, and executive function. Presumptive diagnosis involves demonstrating cognitive impairment, often through the MMSE, excluding similar syndromes (e.g., vascular dementia, Lewy Body dementia) and secondary causes such as toxic (e.g., heavy metal poisoning), metabolic (e.g., electrolyte disturbances, uremia, hyperammonemia, vitamin deficiencies), endocrine (e.g., thyroid, adrenal, and parathyroid derangement), infectious (e.g., neurosyphilis, HIV encephalopathy, meningoencephalitis), polypharmaceutical (e.g., sedative-hypnotic and anticholinergic use), and superimposed psychiatric causes (e.g., major depressive disorder). Medication adverse effect (Choice B) is a well-recognized cause of cognitive impairment that is often reversible in elderly persons. Anticholinergics and sedative-hypnotics are frequently cited as causing depressed mental status or delirium when administered to persons with limited cognitive reserve. This patient does not clearly have an abrupt cognitive decline correlated with initiating such medications. Multi-infarct (vascular) dementia (Choice D) is characterized as a stepwise decline in cognitive functioning following vascular phenomena, for example, presenting as progressive loss of function after each cerebrovascular accident in a series of ischemic strokes. Vitamin B (cobalamin) deficiency (Choice E) presents with dementia resulting from nutritional deficiency and is often accompanied by megaloblastic anemia. 12 r-- r \" , r ,",

Symptoms include fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance, with pallor and glossitis found on physical examination.

Porphyria can arise from genetic mutations, heavy metal poisoning, and as an adverse effect of some medications. It presents with anemia, and often blistering of the skin when exposed to sunlight. Faulty protein transcription (Choice B) can cause many types of anemia; examples include sickle cell anemia and pyruvate kinase deficiency, both of which typically result in hemolytic, normocytic anemias. Inadequate erythropoietin (Choice D) occurs in chronic end-stage kidney disease because of insufficient production from the peritubular capillary interstitial cells. Without erythropoietin, progenitor cells in the bone marrow are not appropriately stimulated to produce red blood cells, resulting in the development of normocytic, non-hemolytic anemia.

These patients are more likely to aspirate gastric contents into the lung, which results in bacterial seeding with gastrointestinal or oral flora and can lead to pneumonia. Frequently, aspiration occurs in a dependent segment of the lung such as bilateral lower lobes when erect or the lingula, right middle lobe, and superior segments of the lower lobes while lying down. Pulmonary abscesses often present with low-grade fevers, weight loss, anemia, and leukocytosis. On chest x-ray, air-fluid levels are seen within the abscess cavity.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Increasing the dose of lisinopril would be the most appropriate recommendation to decrease the patient's risk for renal failure (end-stage kidney disease). Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, which inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme resulting in decreased production of angiotensin II and aldosterone. This results in reduced blood pressure by multiple mechanisms. Additionally, the decreased production of angiotensin II results in relative efferent arteriole dilatation. This leads to decreased glomerular filtration pressure. The patient demonstrates chronic hypertension, which is a leading cause of end-stage kidney disease. Increasing the dose of lisinopril will assist in further decreasing the patient's systemic blood pressure in addition to efferent arteriole dilatation, both of which will reduce intraglomerular pressure. This reduction in intraglomerular pressure will reduce damage to the glomerular capillaries and decrease her risk for end-stage kidney disease. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Protein-restricted diet (Choice A) has been shown to reduce progression of nephropathy in patients with chronic end-stage kidney disease, especially in diabetic nephropathy. This patient's risk for end-stage kidney disease is mostly related to her chronic hypertension for which increasing the dose of lisinopril would demonstrate the most benefit. 24-Hour urine collection for measurement of protein concentration (Choice B) is utilized for the evaluation of nephrotic syndrome and albuminuria for diabetic nephropathy. The patient's nephropathy is likely from chronic hypertension and her urinalysis demonstrates 1+ urine protein, which is a low-level of urine protein. Measurement of 24-hour urine protein would not further assist in her management. Switching from hydrochlorothiazide to furosemide (Choice D) would not appreciably decrease the patient's risk for end-stage kidney disease as these agents do not demonstrate reno-protective properties and are both diuretics. Furosemide is typically used in the management of hypervolemia, while hydrochlorothiazide is a first-line treatment for hypertension management. No further measures are indicated at this time (Choice E) is not the correct answer choice, as the patient's blood pressure remains increased and she would benefit from an increased lisinopril dose to improve her blood pressure and reduce her risk for end-stage kidney disease. r-- r \" , r ,",

Malabsorption of substances in the proximal small bowel ensues, which presents symptomatically as chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, and nutritional deficiencies. Abnormal small bowel absorption results in abnormal serum D-xylose and fecal fat tests.

The patient presents with lower neck pain radiating to her back, hypertensive emergency, and a widened mediastinum on a chest x-ray. These are all findings associated with acute aortic dissection. A CT angiography of the thoracic aorta is indicated to further delineate whether the patient exhibits a type A or B aortic dissection, as this will dictate appropriate management. Regardless of which type of aortic dissection the patient has, it is imperative to appropriately treat the patient's hypertensive emergency. Hypertensive emergency is defined as a blood pressure greater than 180/120 with evidence of end-organ damage (eg, aortic dissection). Intravenous antihypertensive medications should be used for the treatment of hypertensive emergency to appropriately reduce blood pressure and limit progression of end-organ damage. In aortic dissection, to prevent the advancement of the dissection flap and resultant occlusion of branch vessels, the blood pressure should be rapidly reduced using a beta-blocker to lower cardiac output and diminish fluctuations in pulse pressure, combined with an alpha blocker or arterial vasodilator to lower mean 13 arterial pressure by reducing vascular resistance.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Prerenal azotemia refers to an acute kidney injury secondary to decreased renal blood flow, which results in a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), typically in the setting of hypovolemia, hypotension, or renal hypoperfusion. In response to the decreased renal blood flow, renin and angiotensin are upregulated, which stimulates increased absorption of sodium in the proximal convoluted tubule. This leads to decreased fractional excretion of sodium (less than 1% ). The decreased GFR results in decreased tubular flow rate, which consequently leads to increased urea nitrogen reabsorption, although creatinine is unable to be reabsorbed by the renal tubules. This results in an increased serum urea nitrogen (BUN) to serum creatinine (Cr) ratio, typically greater than 20. Treatment of prerenal azotemia requires treatment of the underlying cause of reduced renal blood flow. If untreated, this can progress to worsening acute kidney injury and possible intrinsic renal failure (end-stage kidney disease). lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. Acute glomerulonephritis (Choice A), acute tubular necrosis (Choice B), diabetic nephropathy (Choice C) and interstitial nephritis (Choice D) are all causes of intrinsic renal failure (end-stage kidney disease), which would present with an increased fractional excretion of sodium and a BUN/Cr ratio less than 20, due to underlying tubular dysfunction. Acute glomerulonephritis (Choice A) refers to a variety of glomerular diseases, including nephritic and nephrotic syndromes. Nephritic syndromes typically present with acute end-stage kidney disease with associated hematuria, red blood cell casts, and hypertension. Nephrotic syndrome typically presents with excessive proteinuria (greater than 3 g/day), hyperlipidemia, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Acute tubular necrosis (Choice B) typically occurs following an ischemic or nephrotoxic insult to the kidneys, which results in necrosis of the tubular epithelium. Granular, muddy brown casts are typical on urinalysis. Diabetic nephropathy (Choice C) occurs following nonenzymatic glycosylation of the glomerular basement membrane and efferent arterioles, characteristically presenting as Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions on light microscopy. This progresses over time in patients with diabetes mellitus, initially beginning as microalbuminuria, which can subsequently progress to macroalbuminuria, and then end-stage kidney disease. Interstitial nephritis (Choice D) commonly presents as a hypersensitivity reaction following exposure to certain medications such as penicillin, diuretics, and sulfonamides. It can also occur in the setting of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. It typically presents with pyuria, predominantly eosinophilic. e e e • , • I ., I I I I I • I I I • I .. .. I • 11 .. I II I I I I I I • I .. • I Ii I I II I • I .. I I • • I • I ., .. I • 11 ..

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Obstruction of the small bowel occurs from partial or complete blockage of the small bowel lumen and typically presents with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Partial small bowel obstructions will allow a degree of continued flatus with diminished stooling, and complete obstructions will result in obstipation. Small bowel obstruction (SBO) has many potential causes, although the most common are post-surgical peritoneal adhesions and hernias. On physical exam, SBO typically presents with abdominal tenderness, distention, tympany to percussion, and borborygmi (high-pitched, hyperactive bowel sounds). Potential complications of SBO include bowel rupture and/or necrosis, which can result in sudden-onset peritonitic abdominal signs such as rebound tenderness and guarding. Abdominal x-rays typically demonstrate multiple air-fluid levels in the setting of dilated small bowel loops. Management requires bowel rest and intravenous hydration and sometimes surgical intervention. If the patient has a partial obstruction, the patient should be monitored and provided supportive care. If the patient demonstrates features concerning for a complete obstruction, an exploratory laparotomy should be performed to alleviate the cause of the obstruction. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Cecal volvulus (Choice A) results from twisting of the cecal mesentery and can be a cause of large bowel obstruction. It is less common than sigmoid volvulus and can be associated with a hyper-mobile cecum. lieus (Choice B) refers to intestinal hypomotility without a mechanical obstruction, most commonly occurring following surgery or in the setting of electrolyte abnormalities, and typically presents with diffuse small and large bowel dilatation. Pseudo-obstruction of the colon (Choice D), also known as Ogilvie syndrome, results in dilatation of the large bowel without a mechanical obstruction.

It was commonly caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b prior to widespread pediatric vaccination. Epiglottitis presents with fever and acute severe pharyngitis, drooling, hoarseness, and dysphagia. On lateral neck x-rays, it appears as a \"thumbprint sign.\" Patients typically present in a toxic state and can exhibit rapid respiratory decompensation with the development of strider and airway obstruction. Because of this, first-line therapy is to emergently establish a protected airway through endotracheal intubation. In the setting of epiglottitis, endotracheal intubation should take place in the operating room under direct visualization with a laryngoscope if the patient is stable enough to permit transfer out of the emergency department.",

It can lead to Legionnaires disease, most commonly occurring in patients who\nare chronic smokers or have underlying chronic lung disease. Legionnaires disease is characterized by fever, atypical pneumonia, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. The atypical pneumonia\nmay appear as diffuse, patchy alveolar and interstitial opacities on lung imaging. It can also be associated with hyponatremia.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Choledocholithiasis refers to the presence of a gallstone located within the common bile duct. This can result in varying degrees of obstruction, which dictates the severity of presenting symptoms. Obstructive choledocholithiasis results in colicky right upper quadrant or epigastric pain (biliary colic), nausea, vomiting, and increased direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Direct hyperbilirubinemia can lead to scleral icterus and jaundice. Depending on the location of the common bile duct stone, choledocholithiasis can result in acute pancreatitis, which manifests with epigastric pain and increased pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase). If acute bacterial infection of the biliary tree ensues, this can lead to fever and acute cholangitis. The primary treatment for choledocholithiasis is an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy, followed by cholecystectomy. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Alcoholism (Choice A) is a common cause of acute pancreatitis, which can result in epigastric pain and increased amylase, although would be unlikely to result in direct hyperbilirubinemia. Cholecystitis (Choice B) results from obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone with resultant bacterial infection of the gallbladder, and presents with right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. It would not typically present with increased liver function tests or pancreatic enzymes. Hepatoma (Choice D), also known as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), can present with right upper quadrant tenderness and hepatomegaly with associated hepatic enzyme (AST/ALT) and a-fetoprotein elevation. The main risk factors for HCC are cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B infection. Pancreatic carcinoma (Choice E) often presents with nonspecific symptoms such as chronic abdominal pain radiating to the back, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weight loss. If the pancreatic carcinoma is located in the pancreatic head/neck region, it can result in painless obstructive jaundice. Pancreatic carcinoma would not typically present with acute abdominal pain or increased pancreatic enzymes. r-- r \" , r ,",

These recurrent pulmonary infections can lead to the development of bronchiectasis over time . For further differentiation of the patient's primary immunodeficiency, quantitative immunoglobulin testing should be performed to delineate the patient's immunologic pathophysiology. B-cell disorders include such diseases as X-linked agammaglobulinemia, selective lgA deficiency, and common variable immunodeficiency .

Evaluation for osteoporosis occurs through performance of a DEXA scan and is defined as a bone mineral density less than 2.5 standard deviations compared to a young, normal population (T-score). The most common risk factors for the development of osteoporosis are age, smoking, chronic inflammatory disease , corticosteroid use, and estrogen-depleting conditions in women. Osteoporosis is often asymptomatic but increases the risk for fractures, most commonly involving the hip, vertebrae, and distal radius. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation are the first line for treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. Reduction of active osteoporotic risk factors should also be pursued . Weight-bearing exercises are recommended to slow deterioration of bone mineral density. Bisphosphonates (eg, alendronate) inhibit osteoclast activity.

The aneurysm rupture may have been precipitated by an event increasing her mean arterial pressure, which would increase stress on the aneurysmal vascular wall. Lumbar puncture demonstrates a significant number of red blood cells, which are typical in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage. A CT scan of the head without contrast is typically obtained in the acute setting to confirm the presence of subarachnoid blood, and if confirmed, further angiographic imaging of the head is necessary to identify the presence of an aneurysm.",

As a thrombus occludes the cross-sectional area of a deep vein, the valves, which originate from the walls of the veins, become involved in the thrombus either through compression against the wall of the vessel or through incorporation into the thrombus during propagation. When the thrombus resolves, the residual valve may be dysfunctional from damage to the leaflets, annulus, or diameter of the native vessel. This prevents the valve from functioning effectively and results in retrograde venous flow secondary to gravity. Inadequate venous drainage of the lower extremities can result in varicose veins, chronic edema, and stasis dermatitis.",

When the infection is severe and has infiltrated outside the external ear canal causing extensive tissue destruction, it is termed necrotizing (or malignant) otitis externa, which requires treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Otitis externa is not always necrotizing. The non-necrotizing variant is commonly known as \"swimmer's ear,\" and presents with mild external ear pain, watery discharge, swelling, and erythema of the external acoustic meatus.

Polyuria and associated volume depletion are secondary to the direct effects of hypercalcemia on the kidney, which results in renal resistance and lack of response to anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), known as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

This results in symptoms such as oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, weight gain, skin changes, osteoporosis, and hyperglycemia.

There are multiple potential etiologies of Cushing syndrome, including pituitary adenoma, adrenal tumor, or ectopic paraneoplastic ACTH secretion (eg, small-cell lung cancer). Along with the increased production of cortisol, Cushing syndrome from an adrenal etiology can also result in increased concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) produced within the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex.

This granulomatous expression of the enzyme results in an increased production of active vitamin D3, which leads to increased intestinal absorption of calcium, resulting in hypercalcemia. This vitamin D3- dependent hypercalcemia results in physiologic suppression of parathyroid hormone.

The inferior wall of the heart and the atrioventricular (AV) node often share a common blood supply from the right coronary artery (RCA). When the RCA is blocked, infarction of both the inferior wall and the AV node can occur, which can lead to an AV block with a junctional escape rhythm. In normal sinus rhythm, there is a one-to-one relationship between the P wave and QRS complex, which is not seen in the setting of complete heart block. In fact, there is no relationship between the P and QRS frequencies, with each maintaining its own unique, separate rate per minute.

A lesion located within the anterior and lateral fascicles of the spinal cord white matter would result in injury to the ALS tract and lateral CST. This would result in contralateral loss of fine touch and temperature perception since the primary sensory neuron for the ALS tract decussates within the spinal cord along the ventral white commissure, followed by ascent within the anterolateral tract of the spinal cord.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma most commonly occurs in the pancreatic head. It is often initially characterized by nonspecific vague abdominal discomfort or weight loss. As the pancreatic mass increases in size, it can lead to the obstruction and dilation of both the common bile duct and main pancreatic duct, referred to as a double-duct sign on ultrasound. This can result in painless jaundice and/or pancreatitis from obstruction of these ducts. If the pancreatic adenocarcinoma continues to spread and results in infiltration of surround ing abdominal viscera and/or encasement of adjacent neurovascular structures, this can manifest with severe abdominal pain. The nonspecific nature of pancreatic adenocarcinoma's early symptoms creates a diagnostic dilemma , as many benign conditions present similarly. It is frequently asymptomatic until it creates an obstruction, gastrointestinal dysfunction, perineural or vascular encasement/invasion, or metastatic disease .",

It is characteristically distributed along the location of clothing, perfume, plant contact, or nickel jewelry contact. The rashes are often described as linear or angular in shape. In some cases, the rash can spread from the point of initial contact through transfer of the allergen by hand contact. Frequent allergens resulting in contact dermatitis are nickel, topical antibiotics, and poison ivy or oak . Diagnosis for the specific causative allergen can be made through patch testing, with first-line treatments being topical corticosteroids and avoidance of the culprit allergen.",
