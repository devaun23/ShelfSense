      "correct_answer_explanation": "Patients with wide-complex (ORS greater than 120 msec) tachycardia require emergent medical attention and intervention. Rapid electrical depolarization of the heart and resultant increased heart rate impairs diastolic filling time resulting in low cardiac output leading to hypotension. Such a condition is accompanied by the high likelihood of degeneration to ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. Any patient with an unstable, wide-complex tachycardia requires immediate synchronized cardioversion to abort the rhythm and permit improved cardiac output. Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocols are well-established for such cases; unstable patients (hypotensive, diaphoretic, tachypneic, with altered mental status) should be immediately cardioverted. Stable, perfusing wide-complex arrhythmias (normotensive, minimally symptomatic, with easily palpable pulses) can be treated with antiarrhythmic medication. As well, any patient with pulseless wide-complex tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation should receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation and be defibrillated.",

Administration of nitroglycerin by intravenous drip (Choice B) would be an appropriate choice for hypertensive emergency , refractory anginal chest pain, or as adjunct usage with a beta blocker to lower blood pressure in settings of aortic dissection. Intravenous administration of morphine (Choice C) is appropriate for treating acute pain; however, it may worsen hemodynamics in an unstable patient. Endotracheal intubation (Choice D) may be necessary for airway protection in a patient with depressed mental status, but this patient is showing no immediate signs of airway compromise; his respiratory symptoms are more likely explained by hypoperfusion which should be addressed immediately. ,. \"' , r-- ,. , Exam Section : Item 3 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "A history of chronic hypertension, especially if poorly controlled, along with acute, tearing , substernal chest pain is suggestive of aortic dissection . The tearing of the tunica intima and media in dissection allows for the creation of a false lumen in which blood can accumulate. Further, branch vessels can become occluded by the false lumen leading to end-organ ischemia. In older patients with a history of hypertension, atherosclerotic disease of the vasa vasorum plus breakdown of normal mural collagen and elastin results in accumulation of basophilic ground substance in place of normal tissue architecture. This process is known as cystic medial necrosis of the aorta. This process occurs predominantly in the tunica media - the smooth muscle layer of the arterial wall - and results in progressive weakening that can lead to an increased risk for thoracic aortic aneurysm formation and aortic dissection.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Aortic dissection due to Takayasu arteritis is less likely than medial degeneration for this patient as it is characterized by granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis in large arteries and is most commonly seen in younger females, especially those of Asian ethnicity; it is less likely to occur in a patient in the sixth decade of life with a history of chronic hypertension. Degeneration of the aortic wall from Marfan syndrome (Choice B) results from a genetic mutation leading to impaired synthesis of collagen. Patients with Marfan syndrome characteristically are diagnosed early in life because of lens dislocation, aneurysmal disease, and joint hypermobility. It can also result in early-onset cystic medial degeneration of the aortic root, which places patients at risk for aortic dissection. Marfan syndrome is less likely the cause of this patient's aortic dissection based on the patient's age and history of hypertension. Rupture of a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (Choice D) would result in exsanguination from the aorta into the surrounding aortic adventitia or mediastinum . Sinus of Valsalva aneurysms occur secondary to a number of pathologies, including syphilis, tuberculosis, and chronic cystic medial degeneration. They are less common than aortic dissection as an explanation of the patient's symptoms. Traumatic disruption of the aorta from a fall (Choice E) results from shear forces applied to the aorta during rapid deceleration injury such as a fall or high-energy collision. This typically presents with large-volume acute blood loss and hemorrhagic shock. ,. \"' , r-- r ,,, Exam Section : Item 4 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

Patients will frequently report worsening of symptoms associated with nighttime, seasonal change, exercise, or exposure to smoke, mold, dust , pollen, or cockroaches. It is diagnosed on clinical history, pulmonary function testing, and/or functional challenge testing (e.g., bronchodilator challenge). Treatment is based on severity and involves avoidance of triggers, the use of short- or long-acting beta-agonists (e.g., albuterol, salmeterol), systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, anticholinergics, mast cell stabilizers, leukotriene inhibitors, and anti-lgE agents.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Rapid infusion of 0.9% isotonic saline is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's decompensated hemorrhagic shock. In cases of acute blood loss, small amounts can be tolerated without challenging the ability of the circulatory system to compensate. As the amount of blood loss increases, the circulatory system compensates through fluid retention, increased heart rate, and vasoconstriction. If blood loss continues, these mechanisms become incapable of fully compensating, and shock secondary to hemorrhage occurs . Hemorrhagic shock can be classified by the amount of blood lost, vital signs, physiologic parameters such as falling urine output, exam findings such as diaphoresis, cool extremities, and weak peripheral pulses, and features in the history such as light-headedness. In extreme cases, hypotension occurs, necessitating rapid intravascular volume repletion to prevent circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and death. In the emergent setting, the patient's acute hypovolemia should be replaced with isotonic saline. In hemorrhage, both red blood cells and plasma are lost equivalently; this results in a normal hematocrit , though overall blood volume is decreased.",

        "A": "dextrose in water may be appropriate if normal saline or blood is unavailable, though the osmolality of this fluid results in extravascular losses , making it suboptimal for intravascular volume repletion.

This patient demonstrates a clear primary hemorrhagic shock from hematemesis and does not require a pulmonary artery catheter to diagnose or treat at this time. Gastric lavage with ice-cold saline until bleeding stops (Choice D) would not readily replace intravascular volume though it may have an adjunct role in reducing gastrointestinal blood losses; however, emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) (Choice E) is the first choice for definitive hemorrhage control in capable centers .

Oxygen delivery is a function of cardiac output and oxygen content. If oxygen content falls, cardiac output must rise to maintain equivalent delivery.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (OKA) occurs due to the accumulation of serum ketones such as ~-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone in the setting of deficient insulin signaling. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs because of the relative state of starvation created through absent insulin signaling. Patients present with fatigue, polyuria, shortness of breath, and diffuse abdominal discomfort. Vital signs may show tachycardia and tachypnea. Kussmaul respirations, rapid and deep, is a classic physical exam finding because of respiratory compensation for the underlying metabolic acidosis . Labs typically show increased glucose, ketones, and a high anion-gap because of the accumulation of unmeasured anions in serum . Anion gap is calculated as the difference between sodium and the sum of bicarbonate and chloride anions. Treatment is through replacement of insulin, volume repletion, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions. lncorrectAnswers: B, C, D, and E. Accumulation of lactate (Choice B), also known as lactic acidosis, can occur in multiple different situations such as shock, metabolic derangements, and in response to medications. It can also occur in OKA; however, it is not the primary cause of acidosis . Decreased renal production of ammonium (Choice C) and loss of bicarbonate through the kidneys (Choice D) are both causes of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). RTAs are not caused by the accumulation of an unmeasured anion and do not present with an increased anion gap. Movement of potassium into the cells (Choice E) occurs because of transcellular potassium-proton exchange . Increased movement of potassium into the cells occurs when the serum is alkalotic, not acidotic. Acidosis in the setting of OKA stimulates movement of potassium out of the cells into the serum. ,. \"' , r-- r ,,, Exam Section : Item 9 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Hemophilia A, an X-linked coagulopathy, arises from a genetic deficiency in factor VIII synthesis or activity. Patients often present with easy bruising and hemorrhage involving muscles and joints. Hemorrhage can be life threatening, often requiring transfusions of factor VIII to replace the deficient protein . Patients can acquire antibodies against exogenous factor VIII, which can necessitate larger transfusions to elicit the same hemostatic effect. With an acquired inhibitor, some of the transfused factor VIII will be bound and neutralized by the inhibitor (typically lgG). Testing for factor VIII inhibitor is indicated in such cases . Exposure to the nonnative protein (transfused factor VIII) promotes this appropriate but countertherapeutic immune response.",

Measurement of factor IX concentration (Choice B) is useful in the workup of hemophilia B. This patient has hemophilia A and is presenting with symptoms concerning for the development of an acquired inhibitor of factor VIII. The presence of both hemophilia A and hemophilia B in the same patient is exceedingly rare. Measurement of thrombin time to detect heparin (Choice C) would be appropriate if the patient were using heparin therapeutically . Platelet function tests (Choice D) refer to bleeding time, platelet aggregation, and platelet activation tests. They are classically used to assess qualitative platelet hemostatic defects. This patient presents with a known factor deficiency and progressive under-responsiveness to an exogenously replaced protein, raising suspicion for the presence of an acquired factor inhibitor. ,. \"' , r-- r ,,, o Exam Section : Item 1 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Dizziness and gait instability carry a broad differential diagnosis; these symptoms are often divided into central, peripheral, and secondary causes of symptoms to determine a likely diagnosis. Central causes include cerebrovascular accidents such as ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, tumors of the brain stem and cerebellum, infarction involving the vestibulocochlear nerve, and multiple sclerosis or similar demyelinating disorders. Peripheral causes include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, labyrinthitis, Meniere disease, endolymphatic fistula, or temporal bone fractures, tumors, or lesions. Secondary or systemic causes can include electrolyte imbalances, hypovolemia, cardiac arrhythmia, infections, and vitamin deficiencies, among other causes. Labyrinthitis is inflammation of the inner ear, often involving the vestibulocochlear nerve, and is often preceded by an upper respiratory or ear infection. Classic symptoms include vertigo, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hearing loss. Treatment is supportive, along with the exclusion of emergent causes of vertigo and ataxia, as the condition is typically self-limited. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) (Choice A) is a known cause of central vertigo secondary to impingement of the vestibulocochlear nerve at the brain stem. These tumors often occur at the cerebellopontine angle and are often subclinical; there is an association with neurofibromatosis, and they may present with hearing loss, vertigo, and nystagmus. Preceding infection or dulling of the tympanic membranes would not be expected. Cerebral infarction (Choice B) can cause vertigo by disrupting normal neurologic equilibrium and proprioceptive pathways, especially when such infarction involves the cerebellum, pons, or brain stem nuclei involving the oculomotor, trochlear, abducens, or vestibulocochlear nerves. Nystagmus, motor or sensory neurologic deficits, and cranial nerve deficits would be expected in such cases, and the presentation is typically acute. Signs of vertebrobasilar insufficiency, such as nausea, vomiting, dysarthria, and impaired brain stem reflexes may also be present. Dehydration (Choice C) may present with dizziness or ataxia in the setting of orthostatic hypotension, with patients often describing feelings of light-headedness when rising from supine to seated or seated to standing. It is caused by decreased cardiac output from diminished preload and resolves with volume resuscitation. Endocarditis (Choice D) presents with acute or subacute fever, a new or changing heart murmur, septic emboli to the lung or systemic circulation, and vascular and immunologic phenomena such as Roth spots, Osler nodes, Janeway lesions, and splinter hemorrhages. Multiple sclerosis (MS) (Choice F) presents with neurologic symptoms of varying duration separated in space and time. Common symptoms include optic neuritis, which is often the declaring presentation. Women are more commonly affected than men. Any type of neurologic symptom may occur. MS would not be expected to follow an infection though it may be exacerbated by such, and physical exam findings of tympanic membrane dullness (suggestive of inflammation and fluid in the middle ear) would not be present. r-- r \" , r , Medicine Self-Assessment",

Exposure to asbestos in the shipyard is a known risk factor. Pleural fluid analysis is indicated to characterize the underlying cause, as markers in the pleural fluid can narrow the diagnosis by investigating infection, malignancy, inflammation, and transudative causes of effusion.

        "B": "Exposure to graphite dust has been associated with pneumoconiosis, a cause of restrictive lung disease in the form of pulmonary fibrosis. Isocyanate exposure (Choice C) occurs from industrial application of paints, varnishes, and foams; exposure has been associated with many pulmonary diseases including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchitis, interstitial pneumonia, asthma, emphysema, and pulmonary edema. lsocyanates are not commonly associated with malignant mesothelioma. Mycobacterium kansasii (Choice D) causes chronic pulmonary infection that resembles tuberculosis, presenting with fever, cough, night sweats, and weight loss, often in patients with immunocompromised states. It would not likely present with pleural plaques following years of working in a shipyard. Mycop/asma pneumoniae (Choice E) is a common cause of atypical pneumonia, and presents with acute cough, fever, chills, and shortness of breath. The chest x-ray would typically demonstrate multifocal infiltrates without pleural plaques. Nocardia asteroides (Choice F) causes nocardiosis, which presents as pulmonary or disseminated infection, often in patients who are immunocompromised. The pulmonary variant presents with fever, night sweats, cough, and weight loss, and chest x-ray demonstrates multifocal infiltrates, often with necrosis. Household dwellers exposed to radon (Choice G) are at risk for malignancy. Exposure typically occurs in the home, especially the basement, in geographic regions of prevalence. Radon diffuses into air within basements and homes, where it is inhaled. The decay products are radioactive, which promotes mutations leading to the development of bronchogenic lung cancer, not mesothelioma. Exposure to silicon (Choice H), similar to graphite, leads to pneumoconiosis, characterized by restrictive lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 18 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Shortness of breath, edema, jugular venous distention (JVD), crackles in dependent areas of lung, a history of poorly controlled hypertension, tachypnea, tachycardia, and an x-ray showing cardiomegaly with cephalization of vessels raises suspicion for cardiogenic pulmonary edema because of increased pressures in the left side of the heart, pulmonary veins, and pulmonary capillaries. Pulmonary edema can also occur from non-cardiogenic sources (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome, multifocal pneumonia, burns/inhalation injuries, high altitude, and drowning). Because of increased left-heart filling pressures in heart failure, the pulmonary venous pressure rises, which in turn results in increased pressures in pulmonary capillaries. This increased hydrostatic pressure results in interstitial edema and eventually alveolar edema. This is seen clinically as shortness of breath and respiratory distress and is supported by signs of hypervolemia such as peripheral edema, JVD, S gallop, and crackles on lung examination. Vital signs typically show tachycardia, 3 hypertension, tachypnea, and hypoxia. Treatment is through diuresis to reduce the patient's hypervolemic state and lower cardiac filling pressure, pulmonary venous, and pulmonary capillary pressure. Nitroglycerin, a venodilator, can also be utilized to shift fluid into capacitance vessels and lower preload. Positive pressure ventilation can also reduce alveolar and interstitial edema and drive fluid back into circulation. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. Aspiration pneumonia (Choice A) presents as shortness of breath, cough productive of sputum, and fever, with a focal consolidation on chest x-ray, often in the superior segment of the inferior right lobe of lung. This is the most common location for an aspiration event to occur when a patient is supine. An aspiration event must be in the history to diagnose aspiration pneumonia; thus, the patient will often have a history of swallowing dysfunction, stroke, oropharyngeal or laryngeal malignancy, or a condition that causes frequent vomiting and retching such as alcoholism or bulimia. Bronchiectasis (Choice B) presents with signs of obstructive lung disease, and often follows chronic pulmonary necrotizing infections, which can occur in the setting of cystic fibrosis, Kartagener syndrome, or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Patients will present with wheezing and mucus plugging, and, unless concomitant right heart failure is present, would not necessarily present with signs of hypervolemia (e.g., edema, JVD). Cephalization of vessels would also be atypical, unless left heart failure were also present. Chest x-ray often shows marked bronchial dilatation and wall thickening. Chronic bronchitis (Choice C) presents with chronic productive cough and signs of obstructive lung disease (e.g., wheezing, air trapping). It often occurs in smokers as a component of the spectrum of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in tandem with emphysema. This commonly results in right heart failure from chronic hypoxemic pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction. This would potentially manifest with JVD, ascites, and lower extremity edema, less likely pulmonary edema. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (Choice D) is caused by an exaggerated immune response (typically type 3 or type 4 hypersensitivity) to an inhaled antigen. It can present in acute, subacute, or chronic forms, with the acute form characterized by shortness of breath, cough, and systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, and rash, following exposure to an antigen. The chest x-ray may be normal at this stage or may show interstitial infiltrates. The subacute and chronic forms commonly present with dyspnea, cough, fatigue, and weight loss, and imaging reveals interstitial inflammation and fibrosis of the lung. Pulmonary function tests generally demonstrate a restrictive pattern. Unless concomitant heart failure were present, signs of volume overload and cephalization of the vessels would be unlikely. Pulmonary embolism (Choice F) is characteristically associated with long periods of immobilization such as orthopaedic surgery, intensive care unit stay, long drives, and long plane flights, because of the association with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) formation from venous stasis. DVT classically presents with unilateral lower extremity edema, and when an embolus travels to the lung, the patient may become symptomatic. Classic symptoms include rapid-onset chest pain and dyspnea; if an infarction has occurred, pleuritic chest pain and hemoptysis may be present. Vital signs are often notable for tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia; hypotension can be present if the em bolus is large enough to obstruct blood flow from the right heart. The lungs are typically clear to auscultation, and cardiomegaly and cephalization of the vessels would be unlikely unless concomitant heart failure were present. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 19 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

Blood may also be detectable in stool from extraintestinal sources, such as swallowed blood during epistaxis. The test for occult blood is also sometimes confounded by oral iron supplementation, which can lead to false positive results. If a lower GI tract source is suspected, a colonoscopy is indicated . This allows visualization, biopsy, excision , or cautery of any suspicious lesions, which can be both diagnostic and therapeutic.

CT scan of the abdomen (Choice C) has a role in diagnosis and staging of CRC, however it may miss sessile and stage one or two tumors. Colonoscopy also permits concomitant sampling of any suspicious areas for biopsy, making it a better choice.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Urethral obstruction can occur from obstructive, malignant, infectious, structural, or inflammatory lesions in the penile or prostatic urethra, or at the urethral origin at the bladder. Examples include urethral stricture, urethral trauma, urethritis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis, prostatic abscess, tumor, or hematoma, cystitis, bladder tumors, intraluminal thrombus, indwelling catheter malfunction, kinking, or obstruction, or from inflammation following removal of an indwelling catheter. Failure to void following removal of an indwelling urinary catheter raises suspicion for post-catheter urethral inflammation with resultant acute urinary obstruction. Such obstruction is more common in older male patients with diminished caliber of the prostatic urethra secondary to baseline BPH. Acute urinary obstruction is a urologic emergency and should be treated with placement of a Foley catheter to prevent bladder rupture or post-renal azotemia.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "is a cause of intrinsic renal failure and occurs secondary to toxin exposure. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and sulfas are common precipitants. It is characterized by decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), rising creatinine, and eosinophils on biopsy and urinalysis. Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) (Choice C) is also a cause of intrinsic renal failure secondary to nephrotoxicity from intravenous contrast dye. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain CIN, and it is clinically seen as rising creatinine and decreased GFR following contract administration. AIN and CIN can occasionally lead to severe renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy. Neither would present with an acute inability to void preceded by the discontinuation of an indwelling catheter. End-stage renal disease (Choice D) is characterized by decreased GFR to the extent that remaining renal parenchyma is unable to support physiologic demand for filtration, fluid balance, and electrolyte and acid base balance, necessitating the use of renal replacement therapy such as dialysis or renal transplant. Apart from catastrophic causes such as acute, severe hypoxia or hypotension, end-stage renal disease typically results from a prolonged natural history related to chronically uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, inflammatory diseases such as vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus, or glomerulonephritis syndromes. Hepatorenal syndrome (Choice E) occurs because of concomitant liver failure and resultant splanchnic vessel shunting; this patient has no evidence of liver failure. lschemic acute tubular necrosis (Choice F) is a mechanism for intrinsic acute renal failure and can lead to end-stage renal disease. Without a history of hypoxia or hypotension, ischemic acute tubular necrosis would be unlikely; additionally, it does not result in urinary retention, but rather low GFR and decreased urine production by the kidney with characteristic muddy brown casts on urinalysis. Myoglobinuric acute renal failure (rhabdomyolysis) (Choice G) results in intrinsic renal failure secondary to toxicity of myoglobin on the renal tubular epithelium, resulting in nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis. It presents with low GFR and decreased urine production by the kidney with muddy brown casts on urinalysis, not acute urinary retention. Prerenal azotemia (Choice H) describes a state of increased blood urea nitrogen, often associated with increased creatinine, because of insufficient delivery of blood to the kidney in states of hypoperfusion. This patient may have diminished cardiac output caused by positive pressure ventilation impairing venous return; however, diminished urine production and low urine output, not rapid anuria following abrupt removal of an indwelling catheter, would be expected. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 25 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

There is no effective treatment, although various procedures may be required\nto relieve the patient's cholestasis. Many affected patients will ultimately require a liver transplant.\nIncorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I.\nAcute cholecystitis (Choice A) presents with fever, abdominal pain, and tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant, often in a patient with a history of gallstones. It is occasionally preceded by symptoms of biliary colic.\nJaundice is a less common finding and suggests an alternate, or complicated, diagnosis such as choledocholithiasis or ascending cholangitis.\nAcute pancreatitis (Choice B) presents with epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis, often in patients with a history of gallstones, alcohol use disorder, trauma, hypertriglyceridemia, or hypercalcemia. It can be\ncomplicated by necrosis, hemorrhage, abscess, or the formation of pseudocysts. It is not commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Laboratory evaluation often reveals increased lipase.\nAutoimmune hepatitis (Choice C) presents in a range from asymptomatic to fulminant hepatitis; typically, the presentation includes chronic nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, jaundice, nausea, vomiting,\npruritis, and right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort. An enlarged, tender liver is sometimes found on examination. It is most often seen in females, often in middle age. Laboratory evaluation reveals transaminase elevation,\nand often an increased anti-smooth muscle antibody.\nBudd-Chiari syndrome (Choice D) is characterized by acute onset severe right upper quadrant pain, congestive hepatopathy, and liver failure caused by obstruction of the hepatic veins by thrombosis. Liver enzymes are often\nmarkedly deranged.\nChronic infection from viral hepatitis B or C (Choices E and F) is characteristically associated with right upper quadrant discomfort, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increased transaminases, and abnormal serologic studies\n(eg, HbsAg, Anti-HBs, Anti-HBc, Anti-HCV) showing titers indicative of the infection.\nDrug-induced hepatitis (Choice G) can occur because of several medications, including acetaminophen, isoniazid, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and hormonal medications. Liver\nfunction testing generally shows increased transaminases; obstructive hyperbilirubinemia would be less likely.\nHepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson disease) (Choice H) results from impaired metabolism of copper. Patients often present with liver dysfunction and neuropsychologic impairment (eg, parkinsonism, ataxia, tremors,\ndystonia, dementia, hallucinations, and/or personality changes).\nPrimary biliary cirrhosis (Choice I) presents with symptoms of cholestasis (eg, itching, jaundice) as a result of intrahepatic bile duct strictures and eventually leads to hepatic fibrosis and end-stage liver failure with resultant\nascites, splenomegaly, esophageal varices, and hepatic encephalopathy. It is sometimes associated with thyroid disease, Sjogren syndrome, or rheumatoid arthritis. Laboratory studies often show an increased anti\nmitochondrial antibody. It is more common in women during the fourth to sixth decades of life.\nr--\nr \" , r ,\n\n      \nExam Section : Item 29 of 50 \nMedicine Self-Assessment\nX\nFor each patient with liver enzyme abnormalities , select the most likely diagnosis .",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Interstitial nephritis is a cause of intrinsic renal failure, and often occurs secondary to medication use, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and sulfas being common precipitants. It is characterized by decreased glomerular filtration rate, rising creatinine, and eosinophilic infiltrates seen on biopsy and detected on urinalysis. Patients will have a history of medication exposure and classically present with low grade fever and diffuse rash. Urinalysis typically reveals eosinophiluria, with occasional WBC casts, increased WBC/hpf, and proteinuria. Treatment involves discontinuing the inciting agent. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, E, and F. Acute tubular necrosis often follows an ischemic or nephrotoxic insult and is commonly seen in patients with cardiac arrest following prolonged resuscitation prior to return of spontaneous circulation and in patients with prolonged cardiogenic, obstructive, distributive, or hypovolemic shock. Nephrotoxic agents such as heavy metals and myoglobin can also precipitate acute tubular necrosis. It is characterized on urinalysis by proteinuria, increased WBC/hpf, muddy brown casts, and visualized tubular epithelial cells on urine microscopy {Choice A). Choice C generally reflects a normal urinalysis, with specific gravity, glucose, protein, white and red cells, and casts all within normal limits. Choice D may reflect pyelonephritis, as WBC casts and bacteria are present. Classically, the number of white cells per high power field along with leukocyte esterase and nitrites are also increased in pyelonephritis. Nephritic syndrome typically presents with red blood cell casts and hematuria {Choice E). Choice F may reflect poorly controlled diabetes or a patient taking a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (e.g., canagliflozin) based on the presence of glucosuria, along with a concomitant urinary tract infection given the presence of increased WBCs and bacteria. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 31 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 31 . A 47-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of progressive fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion . He has not had difficulty breathing at night or chest pain. In addition to a heart murmur that was diagnosed when he was in high school , he has diverticulosis and mild osteoarthritis . He takes no medications except a daily multivitamin . He is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 23 kg/m 2 His temperature is • 37°C (98.6°F) , pulse is 82/min , respirations are 18/min , and blood pressure is 135/90 mm Hg.There is no jugular venous distention . The carotid pulse has a slow upstroke . The lungs are clear to auscultation. A grade 2/6 systolic murmur is heard best at the right sternal border and radiates to the apex. There is no change in the murmur with the Valsalva maneuver . There is a paradoxical splitting of S and a prominent apical impulse . An ECG shows left 2 ventricular hypertrophy ; there is no evidence of infarction . Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's heart murmur? A) Atrial septal defect B) Congenital bicuspid aortic valve C) Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy D) Myxomatous degeneration of mitral valve E) Rheumatic heart disease Correct Answer: B. Congenital bicuspid aortic valve classically presents with early signs and symptoms of aortic stenosis and left-sided diastolic heart failure. Patients may complain of fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, diminished exercise tolerance, or syncope with exertion. Exam findings include a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the upper right sternal border, and pulsus parvus et tardus (weak and delayed) may be noted on examination of peripheral pulses. Because of the chronic increased afterload from a fixed obstruction by the valve, left ventricular hypertrophy and resultant diastolic dysfunction can occur. If early aortic stenosis occurs, the patient may be a candidate for aortic valve replacement. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Atrial septal defect (Choice A) presents with fixed splitting of the S heart sound and is caused by a failure of closure of the embryologic connection between the right and left atria. Blood generally flows from the left 2 atrium into the right atrium, increasing the amount within the right heart and pulmonary circuit. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (Choice C) classically presents with a systolic murmur loudest in the lower left sternal border, which is quieter with increased preload and afterload. It is caused by hypertrophy of the septum, creating an outflow obstruction within the left ventricular outflow tract. It classically presents with syncope or sudden cardiac death in an exercising young athlete with a family history of a similar event. Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve (Choice D) can eventually lead to mitral insufficiency, which presents with a holosystolic murmur; however, this condition would not be expected to cause left ventricular hypertrophy or pulsus parvus et tardus. Rheumatic heart disease (Choice E) commonly causes insufficiency murmurs in the acute phase and stenotic murmurs later in life, predominantly affecting the mitral valve. Rheumatic fever typically presents with joint inflammation, pancarditis, subcutaneous inflammatory nodules, erythema marginatum, and Sydenham chorea. Mitral stenosis itself presents with a diastolic murmur radiating to the axilla. If severe enough, it can result in left atrial enlargement, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and flutter. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 32 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

If the infarction results in left ventricular dysfunction, patients may experience cardiogenic pulmonary edema resulting in shortness of breath, tachypnea, hypoxia, audible crackles, and an S or S gallop. Diagnosis is made using clinical history, analysis of cardiac biomarkers, and an ECG which may show ST-segment elevation or depression, inverted T-waves, or Q 3 4 waves. Treatment requires the use of antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel) plus anticoagulants (eg, heparin), pain control, and revascularization through angioplasty, thrombolysis, or coronary artery bypass grafting.

Pulmonary embolism (Choice E) presents with acute chest pain, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, often in a patient with deep venous thrombosis or a known hypercoagulable state. Small pulmonary emboli are often undetectable on chest x-ray, and the ECG may be normal or show sinus tachycardia. Large emboli with infarction are often seen on chest x-ray by secondary signs such as wedge-shaped areas of infarction or via the Westermark sign of unilateral oligemia. The ECG in a pulmonary embolus often shows sinus tachycardia, and if there is right heart strain can also exhibit right axis deviation, S wave in lead 1, Q wave in lead 3, and inverted Twave in lead 3 ('S1Q3T3').

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Mild forgetfulness without significant impairment in ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living, with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 27/30, is most consistent with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI is often seen prior to a diagnosis of dementia, especially Alzheimer type, and includes amnestic (memory-related) and non-amnestic (language, spatial, executive functional impairment) MCI with generally preserved ability to function independently without significant impairment. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Dementia, Alzheimer type (Choice A) is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - fifth edition (DSM-5) as loss of intellectual function within multiple domains: language, memory, perception, motor skills, attention, orientation, problem solving, and executive function. Presumptive diagnosis involves demonstrating cognitive impairment, often through the MMSE, excluding similar syndromes (e.g., vascular dementia, Lewy Body dementia) and secondary causes such as toxic (e.g., heavy metal poisoning), metabolic (e.g., electrolyte disturbances, uremia, hyperammonemia, vitamin deficiencies), endocrine (e.g., thyroid, adrenal, and parathyroid derangement), infectious (e.g., neurosyphilis, HIV encephalopathy, meningoencephalitis), polypharmaceutical (e.g., sedative-hypnotic and anticholinergic use), and superimposed psychiatric causes (e.g., major depressive disorder). Medication adverse effect (Choice B) is a well-recognized cause of cognitive impairment that is often reversible in elderly persons. Anticholinergics and sedative-hypnotics are frequently cited as causing depressed mental status or delirium when administered to persons with limited cognitive reserve. This patient does not clearly have an abrupt cognitive decline correlated with initiating such medications. Multi-infarct (vascular) dementia (Choice D) is characterized as a stepwise decline in cognitive functioning following vascular phenomena, for example, presenting as progressive loss of function after each cerebrovascular accident in a series of ischemic strokes. Vitamin B (cobalamin) deficiency (Choice E) presents with dementia resulting from nutritional deficiency and is often accompanied by megaloblastic anemia. 12 r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 35 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Exertional chest pain accompanied by shortness of breath that improves with rest is suggestive of stable angina pectoris, caused by cardiac ischemia from insufficient perfusion during exertion through narrowed coronary arteries. This patient presents with worsening symptoms of angina, occurring more frequently and for a longer duration of time. This is consistent with unstable angina, defined by anginal symptoms that are new, occur at rest, or are worsening in severity. Unstable angina is a type of acute coronary syndrome, which requires admission to the hospital and urgent diagnostic workup, including serial ECGs, troponin testing, cardiology consultation, and stress test or cardiac catheterization. Patients with unstable angina are stratified based upon the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score, which assists in identifying the need for therapeutic anticoagulation and coronary angiography.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "monitoring of blood glucose concentration during the next episode of chest pain would not be sufficient for workup of this patient's unstable angina and acute coronary syndrome. This patient's symptoms are unlikely to be associated with hyper- or hypoglycemia. The patient will require admission to the hospital for further monitoring and diagnostic workup. Nonexertional tests, such as dipyridamole-thallium-201 scintigraphy (Choice B), are used to evaluate cardiac perfusion in patients who are unable to exercise. Exercise stress test within 24 hours (Choice C) may be indicated, but first, the patient must be urgently admitted to the hospital for further diagnostic workup and management of unstable angina and acute coronary syndrome. Once further diagnostic tests are completed, the patient's risk can be further delineated using the TIMI score to determine the next most appropriate step in management, which may include stress testing and/or coronary angiography. Antianginal drug therapy now and an exercise stress test in 5 days (Choice D) would unnecessarily delay diagnostic workup of this patient's acute coronary syndrome, which may require coronary angiography and revascularization. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 36 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

Reducing ASCVD is a key step in reducing the likelihood of delayed complications such as heart attacks and strokes. The 2019 guideline from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease) states that persons with known ASCVD, such as those having experienced a heart attack or stroke, should be started on a high-intensity statin. The guideline makes several recommendations of moderate or high-intensity statin therapy for persons ages 40 to 75 years at risk for ASCVD based on personal medical history, family history, and laboratory evaluation. Routine screening for persons under age 40 years is generally not recommended apart from reasonable surveillance every 4 to 6 years. Those persons ages 20 to 39 years who are not at an increased risk (below 7.5% risk in the next 10 years), a lifetime or 30-year risk target is reasonable in deciding whether or not to initiate lipid-lowering therapy. Lifestyle modification should always be recommended including weight loss, cardiovascular exercise, smoking cessation, safe alcohol consumption, sleep hygiene, and dietary modification for all persons with an increased level of cholesterol or those at risk for ASCVD. While this patient has increased cholesterol, he has no other obvious personal or family risk factors. Lifestyle modifications should be recommended with routine screening and initiation of lipid lowering therapy if his risk subsequently rises.",

This patient may eventually require screening or diagnosis but does not meet criteria at this time. X-ray of the chest (Choice D) is used to diagnose various cardiothoracic conditions; it is no longer recommended for routine screening. ECG (Choice E) is used to diagnose conditions including but not limited to cardiac arrhythmias, conduction deficits, and myocardial ischemia.

Symptoms include fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance, with pallor and glossitis found on physical examination. Laboratory evaluation reveals anemia, increased mean cell volume, and normal white cell and platelet indices. The presence of hypersegmented neutrophils on peripheral smear is a characteristic finding in megaloblastic anemia. Treatment includes replacing the deficient vitamin and resolving nutritional deficiencies. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Defective porphyrin metabolism (Choice A) is seen in porphyria. Porphyria can arise from genetic mutations, heavy metal poisoning, and as an adverse effect of some medications. It presents with anemia, and often blistering of the skin when exposed to sunlight. Faulty protein transcription (Choice B) can cause many types of anemia; examples include sickle cell anemia and pyruvate kinase deficiency, both of which typically result in hemolytic, normocytic anemias. Inadequate erythropoietin (Choice D) occurs in chronic end-stage kidney disease because of insufficient production from the peritubular capillary interstitial cells. Without erythropoietin, progenitor cells in the bone marrow are not appropriately stimulated to produce red blood cells, resulting in the development of normocytic, non-hemolytic anemia.

Stable angina is defined as chest pain (or an anginal equivalent) that occurs with exertion or stress and resolves with rest or nitroglycerin. It indicates that an obstruction to flow exists within a coronary artery (coronary artery disease), which results in myocardial ischemia during a period of increased myocardial oxygen demand. Classically, this occurs from atherosclerotic plaque causing narrowing of a coronary artery, with resultant insufficient supply of blood during periods of increased demand. If such a plaque ulcerates and a thrombus forms, complete occlusion of a coronary artery can result, which can lead to myocardial infarction. Diagnosing inducible cardiac ischemia is first attempted by way of a stress test, either through exercise or pharmacologic stress. An exercise stress echocardiography scan is appropriate for patients who are able to exercise but who have a baseline-abnormal ECG that would make a stress ECG difficult to analyze for ischemia (e.g., such as a baseline bundle-branch block that results in ST-segment repolarization change, or inverted T waves). A stress echocardiogram evaluates for regional wall motion abnormalities suggestive of regional ischemia following induction of stress on the heart via exercise. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Measurement of serum troponin I concentration {Choice A) is appropriate in the diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome, blunt cardiac injury, myocarditis, or pulmonary embolism. It does not have a role in the diagnosis of stable angina if infarction, injury, or strain on the heart is not suspected. ECG exercise stress test {Choice B) is a first-line screening test in the diagnosis of cardiac ischemia from coronary artery disease, but in patients with an ST-segment baseline ECG abnormality {left or right bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, early repolarization, or ventricular aneurysm), it lacks appropriate sensitivity and specificity. Ventilation-perfusion lung scans {Choice D) are used to assess for mismatches in pulmonary ventilation and perfusion and are most commonly used as a second-line study for pulmonary embolus when a contrast enhanced CT angiogram cannot be performed. Coronary angiography {Choice E) is an invasive means of identifying coronary artery disease and is performed through arterial catheterization; it may be required in the diagnosis or treatment of coronary artery disease but would occur following initial noninvasive evaluation in patients not experiencing an acute coronary syndrome. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 41 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 41 . Immediately after undergoing an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and dilatation for achalasia, a 32-year-old woman has moderate substernal and midback pain . She has no history of serious illness . Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min , respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. The abdomen is soft and nondistended . Esophagography shows a small leak of contrast from the distal esophagus into the left chest. In addition to intravenous antibiotic therapy , which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Placement of an intraluminal esophageal stent B) Placement of a left chest tube C) Nissen fundoplication D) Esophagogastrectomy E) Operative repair of the esoRhageal injury Correct Answer: E. The benefits and risks of any procedure must be considered prior to undertaking the procedure. Upper endoscopy is a generally safe procedure, though complications can include bleeding, aspiration, and perforation, and depending on the purpose of the endoscopy, specific complications such as pancreatitis following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can occur. In the case of achalasia, the endoscopy was performed to dilate the narrowed lower esophageal sphincter to promote passage of food. Stretching of smooth muscle, stricture, and connective tissue, especially if chronic inflammation from food bolus impaction led to compromise of the stromal strength of the esophageal wall, can lead to perforation. A perforated esophagus is diagnosed on water-soluble contrast esophagography. An esophageal perforation permits translocation of gastrointestinal contents such as food, stomach acid, and bacteria into the mediastinum, which if untreated, can lead to a fatal mediastinitis infection. Management of esophageal perforation is through antibiotics plus emergent surgical repair.",

        "A": "Placement of an intraluminal esophageal stent is used to manage an esophageal obstruction, for example, from an esophageal web, stricture, or malignancy. It does not have a primary role in the management of an acute esophageal perforation. Placement of a left chest tube (Choice B) may be necessary if translocated gastric contents develop into an empyema; however, such complication would not be evident for several days and may be avoided altogether with the use of antibiotics. Nissen fundoplication (Choice C) is a primary surgical treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease due to incompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter and involves plication of the gastric fund us around the lower esophagus. It does not have an immediate role in repairing an esophageal perforation.",

        "A": "Observation is inappropriate, as it may result in delay in diagnosis of a potentially lethal malignancy. Radiation therapy (Choice B) may be necessary in treating malignant melanoma, but a diagnosis must first be established. Laser ablation (Choice C) is more frequently used to treat benign cosmetic lesions and would not have a role in the immediate management of malignant melanoma.

A) Administration of chlorambucil B) Administration of heparin C) Thrombopheresis D) Phlebotomy E) Splenectomy CorrectAnswer: D. Polycythemia vera is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder resulting in increased production of all cell lineages (erythrocyte, leukocyte, and thrombocyte) secondary to a JAK2 mutation. It presents with pruritus, especially after hot showers, secondary to increased mast cell production and degranulation. Additionally, it can present with episodic severe, burning pain with red-blue discoloration secondary to blood clot formation in extremity vessels, referred to as erythromelalgia. The marked increase in red blood cell production and hematocrit can lead to the development of hyperviscosity syndrome, which presents with blurred vision and central nervous system symptoms related to vascular congestion. Examination can show splenomegaly and congestion of vessels seen as plethora. Therapeutic phlebotomy results in decreased red blood cell mass and blood volume, which is the best initial treatment for the patient's symptoms. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Administration of chlorambucil (Choice A) is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin disease, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This patient's presentation is most consistent with polycythemia vera. Administration of heparin (Choice B) is appropriate in cases of arterial or venous thrombosis; while this patient may eventually develop a thrombus that requires anticoagulation, at this time there is no evident role for this medication.",

Neurologic examinations show no abnormalities . Laboratory studies show : Serum creatinine 1.6 mg/dl Urine Protein 1+ WBC 1-2/hpf RBC 2-4/hpf Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Benign prostatic hy erplasia B) Cauda equina syndrome C) Dementia , Alzheimer type D) Normal-pressure hydrocephalus E) Urinary tract infection Correct Answer: A. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) affects middle-aged and elderly male patients, occurring because of excess growth of tissue in the central prostate causing a lower urinary tract obstruction. BPH presents with urinary dribbling and incontinence, difficulty starting or maintaining a urinary stream, nocturia, the need to frequently urinate, and incomplete voiding. These symptoms are typically insidious in onset, chronic, and progressive. Diagnosis is made on history, physical, and urodynamic testing, along with ruling out alternate diagnoses (eg, prostatic malignancy). Treatment is with supportive care, alpha blockers, 5-a-reductase inhibitors, and/or surgery. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Cauda equina syndrome (Choice B) is caused by compression of the spinal nerve roots comprising the cauda equina. Often, such compression occurs because of malignancy, trauma (eg, compression fractures with fragment retropulsion), disc herniation, spinal stenosis, spinal epidural abscess, or spinal epidural or subdural hematoma. Symptoms include lower extremity numbness, weakness, paralysis, hyporeflexia, perinea! anesthesia, fecal incontinence with poor rectal tone, and overflow incontinence marked by inability to void. Dementia, Alzheimer type (Choice C) may present with urinary symptoms in a behavioral context such as volitional voiding at inappropriate times or in inappropriate locations. This patient is not showing any signs of dementia. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (Choice D) presents with symptoms of dementia, urinary incontinence, and ataxia. Urinary tract infection (Choice E) presents with urinary incontinence, dysuria, frequency, urgency, and suprapubic discomfort. It is more common in women than men.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Pain and swelling of joints, morning stiffness, fatigue, mild anemia, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and x-rays showing periarticular osteopenia and erosions is concerning for an inflammatory arthropathy such as rheumatoid arthritis, pseudogout, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or similar rheumatologic or immunologic disorder. Once secondary causes such as disseminated gonococcal arthritis, Lyme disease, and septic arthritis have been excluded, the first-line treatment is generally with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Oral alendronate (Choice A), a bisphosphonate osteoclast inhibitor, is used in the treatment of osteoporosis and hypercalcemia. It does not have a primary role in the management of an inflammatory arthropathy. Oral colchicine (Choice B) is used in the management of gout, pseudogout, and pericarditis. Gout and pseudogout result from deposition of crystals into the joint space, which trigger an intense inflammatory reaction. Symptoms are more often acute, monoarticular, and severe. Diagnosis is via arthrocentesis. Intra-articular injection of methylprednisolone (Choice D) may have a role in the treatment of inflammatory arthritis but would generally occur after a trial of NSAIDs; additionally, this local treatment would require multiple injections, increasing the risk of infection and discomfort to the patient. Intravenous cefazolin (Choice E) would be appropriate in some cases of septic arthritis if a susceptible pathogen were diagnosed; this patient does not clearly have septic arthritis and antibiotics are inappropriate at this time. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 46 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 46 .

She takes no medications . Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals . On physical examination , a milky white discharge can be expressed from both nipples. Examination shows no other abnormalities . Her fasting serum prolactin concentration is 40 ng/ml , and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient? A) Application of ice packs to the breasts B) Wearing tight bras C) Bromocriptine theraEJy D) Tamoxifen therapy E) Vitamin E therapy Correct Answer: C. An inappropriate elevation in serum prolactin is defined as hyperprolactinemia and causes production of breast milk and growth of glandular breast tissue. After cessation of breast-feeding, serum prolactin levels typically return to pre-pregnancy levels. Inappropriate elevation of prolactin often arises from a hyperfunctioning anterior pituitary microadenoma and presents with unexpected production of breast milk. Prolactin is negatively regulated by dopamine. Various dopaminergic blocking medications can have galactorrhea as an adverse effect. Further, prolactin is positively regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and in states of hypothyroidism with upregulated TRH, galactorrhea can also occur. With exclusion of the thyroid and any contributions from dopamine antagonists, further diagnostic evaluation should include an MRI of the brain to assess for the presence of a pituitary adenoma. Treatment is with dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine or cabergoline, and if such medications fail or if a macroadenoma is found, surgical resection of the adenoma is required. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Application of ice packs to the breasts (Choice A) and wearing tight bras (Choice B) are recommendations offered to lactating women approaching the end of breast-feeding or for postpartum women who do not wish to pursue breast-feeding. These measures provide relief of discomfort from engorged breast tissue but have no role in treating hormonal dysregulation from pathologic hyperprolactinemia. Tamoxifen therapy (Choice D), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by blocking the trophic action of estrogen on the tumor. It has no role in treating hyperprolactinemia or a pituitary prolactinoma. Vitamin E therapy (Choice E) has been shown to lower prolactin levels in patients with uremia on hemodialysis and has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on pituitary gland hypertrophy; in spite of these findings, it has not been shown to be as effective when compared to dopamine agonists and surgical resection. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 47 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

A) Brachia! plexus injury B) Compartment syndrome C) Herniated cervical disc D) Median nerve injury E) Radial nerve injury Correct Answer: E. The radial nerve courses posterior to the humerus at the midshaft within the radial groove. It is often injured in displaced midshaft humerus fractures, with resulting wrist drop. The radial nerve supplies motor fibers to the triceps brachii and the extensor muscles within the posterior compartment of the forearm and sensory fibers to the dorsum of the forearm, wrist, and hand. It does not innervate the intrinsic muscles of the hand. Injury to the nerve at the mid-diaphyseal humerus causes extensor muscle loss at the hand and wrist, weakness of forearm supination, the presence of wrist drop, and sensory loss over the posterior forearm, dorsum of the hand, and posterior thumb, index, middle, and radial-half of the ring finger. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Brachia! plexus injury (Choice A), depending on the location within the plexus, would involve motor and sensory loss of multiple nerves. A mononeuropathy would be unlikely. Compartment syndrome (Choice B) presents with pain, paresthesia, paresis, poikilothermia, pallor, and pulselessness. It occurs because of increased pressure from swelling or hemorrhage within a fixed-space myofascial compartment. When the pressure approaches or exceeds diastolic blood pressure, blood flow becomes impaired. The compartment and any downstream-supplied structures can become ischemic. With an otherwise normal exam, the localization of the patient's findings to radial nerve injury is much more likely. Herniated cervical disc (Choice C) can occur from traumatic injury and is a known cause of cervical radiculopathy. Usually, one single nerve root is affected, and it commonly presents with pain in a radicular pattern. Weakness of muscles innervated by multiple cervical spinal levels would be less likely outside of catastrophic injury to the cervical spine. Median nerve injury (Choice D) presents with weakness involving the flexor compartment of the forearm, thenar eminence, and first two lumbrical muscles, along with diminished sensation over the anterior forearm and lateral hand. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 49 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Aspiration pneumonia is characterized by fever, cough productive of foul-smelling sputum, malaise, and chest discomfort following an aspiration event; untreated or complicated aspiration pneumonia can lead to the development of a lung abscess, especially with the pathogen Klebsiel/a pneumoniae. Patients at higher risk for aspiration include those with impaired airway-protective reflexes (eg, stroke, myasthenia gravis, depressed mental status), those with frequent or forceful emesis (eg, alcohol use disorder, cyclic vomiting syndrome), or those with abnormal pharyngeal or airway anatomy (eg, malignancy, tracheo-esophageal fistula). These patients are more likely to aspirate gastric contents into the lung, which results in bacterial seeding with gastrointestinal or oral flora and can lead to pneumonia. Frequently, aspiration occurs in a dependent segment of the lung such as bilateral lower lobes when erect or the lingula, right middle lobe, and superior segments of the lower lobes while lying down. Pulmonary abscesses often present with low-grade fevers, weight loss, anemia, and leukocytosis. On chest x-ray, air-fluid levels are seen within the abscess cavity. Treatment is with antibiotics, prevention of recurrent aspiration, and source control with surgical resection or percutaneous drainage. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Aspergillomas (Choice A) are fungal masses that often arise within existing cavitary lesions of the lung, such as those caused by previous infection with tuberculosis or from cavitary squamous cell lung carcinoma. Bronchiectasis (Choice B) is abnormal dilatation of the bronchi that results from recurrent necrotizing infections. Risk factors for bronchiectasis are cystic fibrosis, Kartagener syndrome, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. There are many types of lung cancer (Choice D), such as small cell and non-small cell carcinoma. Lung cancer often presents with hemoptysis and weight loss, but unless a superinfection were present, an air-fluid level would not be expected. Rather, a solitary nodular, mass-like opacity on a chest x-ray or CT would be a more likely presentation. Homeless persons, patients suffering from alcohol use disorder, incarcerated patients, those from endemic areas (eg, Africa, South America), and those living in close contact are more likely to contract tuberculosis (Choice E). Tuberculosis classically presents with fever, night sweats, weight loss, and hemoptysis. The chest x-ray in reactivation tuberculosis classically shows cavitary lesions in the apices of the lung, with possible evidence of a Ghon complex (pulmonary calcified granulomas and hilar adenopathy) from the prior primary tuberculous infection. r-- r \" , r ,",

There are two main causes of renal artery stenosis: fibromuscular dysplasia and atherosclerosis. In younger patients, fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause, while older patients develop renal artery stenosis more commonly from atherosclerosis. This patient exhibits a carotid bruit, likely also secondary to atherosclerosis. Diagnosis is established with renal artery Doppler ultrasonography or magnetic resonance angiography.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Increasing the dose of lisinopril would be the most appropriate recommendation to decrease the patient's risk for renal failure (end-stage kidney disease). Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, which inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme resulting in decreased production of angiotensin II and aldosterone. This results in reduced blood pressure by multiple mechanisms. Additionally, the decreased production of angiotensin II results in relative efferent arteriole dilatation. This leads to decreased glomerular filtration pressure. The patient demonstrates chronic hypertension, which is a leading cause of end-stage kidney disease. Increasing the dose of lisinopril will assist in further decreasing the patient's systemic blood pressure in addition to efferent arteriole dilatation, both of which will reduce intraglomerular pressure. This reduction in intraglomerular pressure will reduce damage to the glomerular capillaries and decrease her risk for end-stage kidney disease. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Protein-restricted diet (Choice A) has been shown to reduce progression of nephropathy in patients with chronic end-stage kidney disease, especially in diabetic nephropathy. This patient's risk for end-stage kidney disease is mostly related to her chronic hypertension for which increasing the dose of lisinopril would demonstrate the most benefit. 24-Hour urine collection for measurement of protein concentration (Choice B) is utilized for the evaluation of nephrotic syndrome and albuminuria for diabetic nephropathy. The patient's nephropathy is likely from chronic hypertension and her urinalysis demonstrates 1+ urine protein, which is a low-level of urine protein. Measurement of 24-hour urine protein would not further assist in her management. Switching from hydrochlorothiazide to furosemide (Choice D) would not appreciably decrease the patient's risk for end-stage kidney disease as these agents do not demonstrate reno-protective properties and are both diuretics. Furosemide is typically used in the management of hypervolemia, while hydrochlorothiazide is a first-line treatment for hypertension management. No further measures are indicated at this time (Choice E) is not the correct answer choice, as the patient's blood pressure remains increased and she would benefit from an increased lisinopril dose to improve her blood pressure and reduce her risk for end-stage kidney disease. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 8 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the next most appropriate step for this patient given its diagnostic and therapeutic function. The patient presents following recurrent episodes of nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, potentially secondary to recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. The CT scan of the abdomen demonstrates a pseudocyst in the pancreatic parenchyma. Pancreatic pseudocysts are a potential complication of acute pancreatitis and are granulation tissue lined collections of simple fluid located in the pancreatic parenchyma or in the peripancreatic region. Pancreatic pseudocysts can result in persistent elevation of serum pancreatic enzymes and recurrent bouts of epigastric abdominal pain. Intervention is indicated for pseudocysts if they are larger than 5 cm or are symptomatic. The first-line intervention for drainage of the pseudocysts is endoscopic by either a transpapillary approach or through creation of a cystogastrostomy or cystoduodenostomy. These result in the creation of drainage pathways between the cyst and gastrointestinal tract. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. HIDA scan (Choice A) is used for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. If there is lack of visualization of the gallbladder after administration of the radioactive tracer, this indicates the presence of acute cholecystitis with blockage of the cystic duct secondary to an impacted, non-mobile gallstone. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (Choice C) alone would not allow for definitive diagnosis and therapeutic intervention of the pseudocyst. Symptomatic pseudocysts larger than 5 cm in diameter require drainage through either a transpapillary approach or cystogastrostomy/cystoduodenostomy. Mesenteric angiography (Choice D) is indicated for definitive evaluation of the mesenteric vessels. This may be performed in the setting of mesenteric ischemia with the goal to localize and treat an obstruction to improve mesenteric blood flow or in the setting of a gastrointestinal bleed, which can be treated with vascular embolization by interventional radiology. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (Choice E) is indicated for visualization of the biliary tree to further delineate findings following ERCP or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or if prior ERCP was unsuccessful in cannulation of the duodenal papilla. Additionally, this technique can be used for therapeutic placement of biliary drains or stents. r-- r \" , r , o Exam Section : Item 1 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Villous atrophy in the small bowel is a characteristic finding of celiac disease. Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy which is mediated through immune intolerance of the protein gliadin, commonly found in wheat products. This results in inflammatory infiltration of the proximal small bowel, which leads to characteristic intraepithelial lymphocytosis, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. Malabsorption of substances in the proximal small bowel ensues, which presents symptomatically as chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, and nutritional deficiencies. Abnormal small bowel absorption results in abnormal serum D-xylose and fecal fat tests. D xylose is absorbed passively in the proximal small bowel; reduced serum D-xylose indicates reduced small bowel mucosal surface area for absorption. The increased concentration of fecal fat indicates intestinal malabsorption of lipids, also seen in the presence of abnormal small bowel mucosa.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Bacterial overgrowth in the small bowel occurs in the setting of impaired intestinal peristalsis, which allows for the uncontrolled growth of bacteria caused by the loss of appropriate peristaltic propulsion. This can result in intestinal malabsorption, diarrhea, bloating, and chronic abdominal pain. The diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth occurs through the hydrogen breath test. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (Choice B) occurs in the setting of chronic pancreatitis, and results in insufficient pancreatic enzyme production and secretion. This leads to inadequate digestion of macromolecules and resultant malnutrition, presenting with diarrhea and steatorrhea. Failure of bile acid excretion (Choice C) and reabsorption (Choice D) would result in the development of steatorrhea secondary to impaired fat digestion and absorption. Cholestasis and structural causes of biliary obstruction can result in impaired bile acid excretion. Bile acids are absorbed in the terminal ileum. Absorption can be impaired by pathologies affecting the terminal ileum, such as Crohn disease. Lactase deficiency (Choice E) results in dietary intolerance to lactose, a carbohydrate found in human and cow milk. Patients present with abdominal cramping, bloating, and diarrhea following ingestion of dairy products. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 11 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 11 . A 77-year-old woman comes to the physician because of palpitations for 2 days. She has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss during the past 6 months. Her temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F) , pulse is 120/min and irregular , respirations are 24/min , and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. Examination shows nontender enlargement of the left lobe of the thyroid gland. Serum studies show a thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration less than 0.05 µU/ml and thyroxine {T concentration of 30 µg/dl . A 1311s tudy shows a single area of increased uptake in the left lobe of the thyroid gland and suppressed uptake elsewhere in the gland . Which of the following is the most likely ) 4 mechanism of these findings? A) Autoimmune destruction of thyroid cells B) Focal granulomatous inflammation C) Parafollicular cell cytokine overproduction D) Production of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin E) Autonomous T !)reduction 4 Correct Answer: E. Autonomous T production is the most likely mechanism for the patient's hyperthyroidism. The patient presents with weight loss, palpitations, and tachycardia, which are typical symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Lab 4 values demonstrate a low thyroid-stimulating hormone {TSH) concentration and increased thyroxine {T concentration. This indicates the patient has primary hyperthyroidism, with the origin of hyperthyroidism likely ) 4 within her thyroid gland. On physical exam, there is a nontender left thyroid lobe enlargement with a single \"hot\" nodule on radioactive iodine uptake {RAIU) scan. These findings are consistent with a toxic adenoma, which autonomously produces thyroxine resulting in clinical hyperthyroidism. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Autoimmune destruction of thyroid cells {Choice A) occurs in the setting of chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder that presents with anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. In the acute phase, chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis can present with hyperthyroidism because of underlying follicular cell damage and release of thyroid hormone, although this would present with diffusely decreased 1-131 uptake on an RAIU scan. Focal granulomatous inflammation {Choice B) refers to subacute {de Quervain) thyroiditis, which is a self-limited thyroiditis that typically presents with tender thyroid enlargement and is associated with flu-like symptoms. Parafollicular cell cytokine overproduction {Choice C) refers to the production of calcitonin by the parafollicular cells, which can be abnormally increased in the setting of medullary thyroid cancer. This would typically not affect thyroid hormone production except in the case of advanced medullary thyroid cancer infiltrating adjacent functional thyroid tissue. This scenario could present with hypothyroidism from insufficient thyroid hormone production. Production of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin {Choice D) occurs in Graves disease which results in primary hyperthyroidism with associated exophthalmos and pretibial myxedema. RAIU typically demonstrates diffuse 1-131 uptake without a focal nodule. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 12 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Chest x-ray is indicated for the evaluation of nontension pneumothorax. The patient presents after rapid ascent during scuba diving, which places him at increased risk for decompression sickness, which can have multiple manifestations. Decompression sickness occurs when dissolved gases precipitate out of solution in the body and form bubbles or when gas expands because of the rapid decrease in ambient pressure. These mechanisms increase the risk for air emboli, arthropathy, tympanic membrane rupture, and pneumothoraces. On physical exam of this patient, there are decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance to percussion in the left hemithorax, which indicates the presence of a pneumothorax. The evaluation for a pneumothorax includes a chest x-ray. Depending on the size of the pneumothorax, the patient may require thoracostomy for appropriate management. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Measurement of serum o-dimer concentration (Choice A) is recommended for evaluation of patients with low pretest probability of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary em bolus. If the o-dimer is increased, the next appropriate step would be ultrasound and Doppler evaluation of the lower extremity veins for a DVT or CT chest angiography for evaluation of a pulmonary embolism. ECG (Choice C) is indicated for evaluation of cardiac arrhythmias and acute coronary syndromes. The patient presents with midchest pain, which is likely secondary to his left-sided pneumothorax, not myocardial ischemia/infarction. The patient does not exhibit any risk factors for an acute coronary syndrome. Echocardiography (Choice D) entails ultrasound evaluation of the heart, allowing for visualization of pericardia! pathology and cardiac morphology, motion, ejection fraction, and valvular function. Lung ultrasound, not cardiac, is useful in the evaluation of pneumothorax. CT scan of the thorax (Choice E) can be performed to evaluate for a variety of thoracic pathology, both acute and chronic. This patient demonstrates physical exam findings concerning for a nontension left-sided pneumothorax, which would be more rapidly evaluated using a chest x-ray rather than CT scan of the chest. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 14 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is an obstructive lung disease characterized by decreased lung function from a combination of features of chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema, resulting in airflow obstruction on expiration. The patient is presenting with a COPD exacerbation, characterized by shortness of breath and shallow respirations. His presentation is likely further exacerbated by the administration of 100% oxygen by face mask, which in a patient with COPD can theoretically result in depression of respiratory drive and further worsening of the ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Depressed ventilation can result in acute hypercarbia, which can lead to an acute decrease in level of consciousness.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Hypoxemia does not likely account for the patient's decreased level of consciousness, as he was treated with 100% oxygen by face mask. This can result in elevation of the patient's oxygen saturation above his normal baseline from underlying COPD, which can theoretically lead to reduced respiratory drive and worsening of the ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Metabolic acidosis (Choice C) can occur in the setting of multiple causes, either with or without an associated anion gap. This patient presents with an acute COPD exacerbation with depressed ventilation, whereas metabolic acidosis is typically followed by increased ventilation via respiratory compensation. Oxygen toxicity (Choice D) can occur after the supplemental administration of high concentration oxygen, which results in overproduction of reactive oxygen species, and can manifest with primarily neurotoxic symptoms such as vision and hearing changes, dizziness, nausea, altered mental status, and convulsions. Respiratory alkalosis (Choice E) occurs in the setting of hyperventilation. The patient presents with a COPD exacerbation and inadequate ventilation, which results in hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 15 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X"

The patient presents with lower neck pain radiating to her back, hypertensive emergency, and a widened mediastinum on a chest x-ray. These are all findings associated with acute aortic dissection. A CT angiography of the thoracic aorta is indicated to further delineate whether the patient exhibits a type A or B aortic dissection, as this will dictate appropriate management. Regardless of which type of aortic dissection the patient has, it is imperative to appropriately treat the patient's hypertensive emergency. Hypertensive emergency is defined as a blood pressure greater than 180/120 with evidence of end-organ damage (eg, aortic dissection). Intravenous antihypertensive medications should be used for the treatment of hypertensive emergency to appropriately reduce blood pressure and limit progression of end-organ damage. In aortic dissection, to prevent the advancement of the dissection flap and resultant occlusion of branch vessels, the blood pressure should be rapidly reduced using a beta-blocker to lower cardiac output and diminish fluctuations in pulse pressure, combined with an alpha blocker or arterial vasodilator to lower mean 13 arterial pressure by reducing vascular resistance. Labetalol is a nonspecific adrenoreceptor blocker that targets both a - and -adrenoreceptors, making it an ideal choice. 1 1",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Upper endoscopy is the most appropriate next step in management for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERO) resistant to medication therapy and/or with the development of solid food dysphagia. GERO typically presents with burning epigastric and lower chest pain that radiates superiorly and is exacerbated by the ingestion of large meals. First-line therapy for GERO is an empiric trial of proton pump inhibitors or H2 receptor blockers. If the patient demonstrates reflux that is nonresponsive to medication therapy, an upper endoscopy should be performed for definitive evaluation of the esophagus, especially if the patient develops dysphagia. Oysphagia may indicate the development of reflux-associated sequelae such as erosive or eosinophilic esophagitis, Barrett esophagus, or esophageal carcinoma. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, 0, and F. Adding metoclopramide to the medication regimen (Choice A) would not be the best choice, as metoclopramide is a 02 receptor antagonist that increases gastric contractility and motility. It is used primarily for the treatment of gastroparesis and as an antiemetic. It can be used for persistent GERO because of its effect on increasing lower esophageal sphincter tone, but its potentially severe adverse effects (ie, parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia) mean this should only be used for severe, resistant cases of GERO. Adding omeprazole to the medication regimen (Choice B) and switching to famotidine (Choice C) or omeprazole (Choice 0) are not appropriate next steps in management since the patient did not have a response to empiric treatment with the histamine-blocking medication ranitidine and has developed solid food dysphagia. Additionally, no further testing or pharmacotherapy (Choice F) is not appropriate since her GERO did not improve with empiric therapy. Because of her medication-resistant GERO, her esophagus needs to be definitively evaluated for reflux-associated sequelae or alternative culprit lesions. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 24 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

Hodgkin disease is a type of lymphoma, predominantly B-cell in origin, that occurs most commonly in patients ages 20-30 years and 55-65 years. Patients typically present with lymphadenopathy along with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss (B symptoms), hepatosplenomegaly, and pruritus. Pel-Ebstein fevers refer to recurrent high fevers for 1 to 2 weeks followed by 1- to 2-week afebrile periods. A specific sign for Hodgkin disease associated lymphadenopathy is alcohol-induced pain at the enlarged lymph node sites. The most common sites for lymphadenopathy are the neck and mediastinum.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Prerenal azotemia refers to an acute kidney injury secondary to decreased renal blood flow, which results in a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), typically in the setting of hypovolemia, hypotension, or renal hypoperfusion. In response to the decreased renal blood flow, renin and angiotensin are upregulated, which stimulates increased absorption of sodium in the proximal convoluted tubule. This leads to decreased fractional excretion of sodium (less than 1% ). The decreased GFR results in decreased tubular flow rate, which consequently leads to increased urea nitrogen reabsorption, although creatinine is unable to be reabsorbed by the renal tubules. This results in an increased serum urea nitrogen (BUN) to serum creatinine (Cr) ratio, typically greater than 20. Treatment of prerenal azotemia requires treatment of the underlying cause of reduced renal blood flow. If untreated, this can progress to worsening acute kidney injury and possible intrinsic renal failure (end-stage kidney disease). lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. Acute glomerulonephritis (Choice A), acute tubular necrosis (Choice B), diabetic nephropathy (Choice C) and interstitial nephritis (Choice D) are all causes of intrinsic renal failure (end-stage kidney disease), which would present with an increased fractional excretion of sodium and a BUN/Cr ratio less than 20, due to underlying tubular dysfunction. Acute glomerulonephritis (Choice A) refers to a variety of glomerular diseases, including nephritic and nephrotic syndromes. Nephritic syndromes typically present with acute end-stage kidney disease with associated hematuria, red blood cell casts, and hypertension. Nephrotic syndrome typically presents with excessive proteinuria (greater than 3 g/day), hyperlipidemia, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Acute tubular necrosis (Choice B) typically occurs following an ischemic or nephrotoxic insult to the kidneys, which results in necrosis of the tubular epithelium. Granular, muddy brown casts are typical on urinalysis. Diabetic nephropathy (Choice C) occurs following nonenzymatic glycosylation of the glomerular basement membrane and efferent arterioles, characteristically presenting as Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions on light microscopy. This progresses over time in patients with diabetes mellitus, initially beginning as microalbuminuria, which can subsequently progress to macroalbuminuria, and then end-stage kidney disease. Interstitial nephritis (Choice D) commonly presents as a hypersensitivity reaction following exposure to certain medications such as penicillin, diuretics, and sulfonamides. It can also occur in the setting of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. It typically presents with pyuria, predominantly eosinophilic. e e e • , • I ., I I I I I • I I I • I .. .. I • 11 .. I II I I I I I I • I .. • I Ii I I II I • I .. I I • • I • I ., .. I • 11 ..

Urethral obstruction (Choice F) would result in postrenal azotemia from obstruction of the urinary outflow from the bladder. Postrenal azotemia occurs when outflow from bilateral kidneys is obstructed from an underlying pathology such as bladder cancer, prostate cancer or hyperplasia, urethral stricture, or bilateral ureteral fibrosis or stricture. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 28 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

Psoriatic arthritis (Choice C) is a subtype of seronegative spondyloarthritis associated with psoriasis. It is typically asymmetric and often presents with dactylitis and involvement of the distal interphalangeal joints. Rheumatoid arthritis (Choice D) is an autoimmune inflammatory arthropathy that results in symmetric involvement of multiple joints, most commonly the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of the hands, demonstrating articular erosions and progressive joint space narrowing. Ulnar deviation of the fingers and boutonniere and swan neck deformities commonly occur. Septic arthritis (Choice E) results from bacterial infection of the synovial joint space, most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus. The affected joint demonstrates pain, swelling, and erythema. Arthrocentesis is indicated for the evaluation of monoarticular erythema and swelling to evaluate for septic arthritis, which characteristically is purulent and demonstrates WBCs greater than 50,000/mm 3 • Systemic lupus erythematosus (Choice F) can result in a nonerosive arthropathy, commonly affecting the hands, feet, elbows, and knees.

Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.3 g/dL Leukocyte count 10,000/mm 3 Segmented neutrophils 90% Bands 10% Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 90 mm/h Urine blood positive Blood cultures are obtained . Which of the following is the most likely underlying cardiac abnormality? A) Calcification of a bicuspid aortic valv B) Calcified mitral annulus C) Myxomatous degeneration of the aortic valve D) Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve E) Myxomatous degeneration of the tricuspid valve F) Rheumatic disease of the mitral valve G) Rheumatic disease of the tricuspid valve Correct Answer: A. Calcification of a bicuspid aortic valve can lead to the development of aortic stenosis, which is characterized by a systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur heard best at the right second intercostal space. Bicuspid aortic valves exhibit two leaflets instead of the normal three. It is congenital in nature and can be associated with genetic disorders [e.g., gonadal dysgenesis 45,X (Turner syndrome)]. Bicuspid aortic valves result in altered biomechanics of the valve, increasing the risk for valve degeneration at an earlier age. This valve degeneration results in dystrophic calcification over time, limiting the biomechanics of aortic valve opening, and resulting in aortic stenosis. This degeneration of the valve increases the patient's risk for acute and/or subacute endocarditis, especially after a dental procedure. Additionally, severe aortic stenosis can result in hemolytic anemia from red blood cell lysis as they traverse the valve, which may explain the patient's anemia and hemoglobinuria.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "A calcified mitral annulus involves dystrophic calcification of the fibrous annulus of the mitral valve. This increases the risk for development of mitral stenosis, which is evidenced by a diastolic murmur best heard in the left fourth or fifth intercostal space along the midclavicular line. Myxomatous degeneration of the aortic valve (Choice C), mitral valve (Choice D), and tricuspid valve (Choice E) can be primarily or secondarily related to an underlying connective tissue disorder (eg, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome). Myxomatous degeneration increases the risk for regurgitant murmurs of the involved valve. Rheumatic disease of the mitral valve (Choice F) and tricuspid valve (Choice G) may be acute or chronic in nature. Acute rheumatic heart disease is a sequela from infection with group A streptococci and most commonly affects the mitral valve. Acute rheumatic disease can lead to incompetence of the involved valves and late sequelae of chronic rheumatic disease can result in stenosis of the involved valves. Neither mitral nor tricuspid stenosis would result in a systolic murmur in the right second intercostal space. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 32 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X"

As well, because of the lack of functional a -antitrypsin release into the systemic circulation, there is an imbalance of proteases and anti-proteases in 1 the lung parenchyma, resulting in the destruction of alveolar septa and development of panacinar emphysema. Panacinar emphysema is characterized by emphysematous destructive changes of pulmonary alveolar tissue beginning in bilateral lung bases resulting in bullous changes of the lungs, with the potential to spread diffusely.

The patient exhibits symptoms of hyperthyroidism secondary to Graves disease, including exophthalmos, goiter, and lid lag. Propylthiouracil and methimazole inhibit thyroid peroxidase, while propylthiouracil also inhibits peripheral conversion of T to T by blocking 5'-deiodinase. A 4 3 rare adverse effect of these medications is agranulocytosis, resulting in insufficient production of segmented neutrophils. This results in susceptibility to a variety of infections and increased risk for sepsis in the setting of neutropenic fever. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Autoimmune neutropenia (Choice A) is a rare hematologic disorder characterized by autoantibody-induced destruction of neutrophils. This patient exhibits symptoms of hyperthyroidism for which she received medication therapy and developed the adverse effect of agranulocytosis. Cyclic neutropenia (Choice B) is a rare disease resulting in recurrent episodes of neutropenia, typically every 3 weeks. Patients can also present with symptoms of lethargy, fever, and mucosal ulcerations. Radioactive iodine-induced neutropenia (Choice D) can occur due to myelosuppressive effects of radioactive iodine, although this is rare given the low doses used for the treatment of hyperthyroidism secondary to Graves disease. The patient received medical therapy for her hyperthyroidism, not radioactive iodine therapy. Thyroid storm (Choice E) is a serious potential complication of hyperthyroidism following an acute stress such as trauma or infection. Characteristic presenting symptoms of thyroid storm include fever, diarrhea, tachyarrhythmia, altered mental status (eg, delirium, agitation), and potential coma or death if not emergently treated.

A lesion affecting the left MLF would result in impaired left eye adduction during movement of the eyes to the right, due to impaired signal to the left oculomotor nerve nucleus. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Left cerebral hemisphere (Choice A) lesions may result in a variety of neurologic deficits ranging from motor and sensory deficits involving the right side of the body and aphasia, depending on the location of the lesion and the side of the patient's dominant hemisphere. If the lesion involves the left frontal eye fields, the patient would present with conjugate gaze deviation toward the lesion. A lesion within the left paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) (Choice C) would result in conjugate movement of both eyes away from the side of the lesion. For example, a left PPRF lesion would result in conjugate gaze deviation to the right. Right cerebellar hemisphere (Choice D) lesions would result in ipsilateral extremity ataxia, intention tremors, and loss of balance toward the side of the lesion.

HIV-1 (Choice C) is the most common strain of the human immunodeficiency virus, a retrovirus that infects human T cells, resulting in immunosuppression. It is diagnosed through the combination of an ELISA followed by Western blot assay. It can result in an acute HIV syndrome presenting with systemic inflammatory symptoms such as fever, chills, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, and sore throat. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Choice D) is a gram-negative diplococcus that can present with various symptoms such as cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome, disseminated gonorrhea, septic arthritis, and urethritis. Urethritis secondary to infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae typically presents with severe mucopurulent discharge, different than the watery discharge from Chlamydia trachomatis. Treponema pallidum (Choice E) is the causative spirochete bacterium for syphilis, which presents in multiple stages with varying symptoms, including primary with a painless chancre, secondary with fever, lymphadenopathy, and condylomata lata, and tertiary with tabes dorsalis, aortitis, and gummas. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 39 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X"

This typically occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after an inciting stress event, such as an acute infection. The increased osmolality results in excessive osmotic diuresis in the kidneys, which leads to progressive, marked dehydration. Presenting symptoms include lethargy, thirst, polyuria, altered mental status, and potential coma and death if untreated. Laboratory values typically demonstrate hyperglycemia (greater than 500 mg/dL), and increased osmolality (greater than 320 mOsm/kg) without acidosis because of the lack of ketone production. Treatment requires aggressive fluid resuscitation with isotonic intravenous fluids and insulin.",

Nephritic syndromes typically present with acute end-stage kidney disease with associated hematuria, red blood cell urine casts, and hypertension. Nephrotic syndrome typically presents with excessive proteinuria (greater than 3 g/day), hyperlipidemia, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Infective endocarditis (Choice B) refers to acute or subacute bacterial infection of the cardiac valvular endocardium, most commonly from infection with Staphylococcus aureus (acute) and/or viridans streptococcus (subacute). It can present with an array of symptoms, most commonly fever, new murmur, anemia, glomerulonephritis, Roth spots, and Osler nodes.",
        "E": "Myxedema refers to a severe hypothyroid state and presents with edema, lethargy, hypotension, and electrolyte disturbances, not with acute onset hyperglycemia. Nephrogenic diabetes insipid us (Choice F) can be caused by genetic or acquired causes, including mutation of the V -receptor in the renal collecting tubules, heavy metal intake, or adverse effects of medications, 2 resulting in resistance to anti-diuretic hormone. Salicylate toxicity (Choice H) results in early onset respiratory alkalosis with late onset anion gap metabolic acidosis and would not cause hyperglycemia. Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (vasopressin) (Choice I) results from excessive ADH production most commonly in the setting of small cell lung carcinoma or intracranial pathology.

A) Glomerulonephritis B) Infective endocarditis C) Nephrolithiasis D) Rhabdomyolysis E) Urinary tract infection CorrectAnswer: D. Rhabdomyolysis refers to the abnormal breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue that can occur from multiple causes. The most common causes of rhabdomyolysis are crush/compression injuries such as prolonged immobility, excessive exertion, alcohol abuse, medication, and toxic substances. The breakdown of skeletal muscle myocytes results in release of myoglobin and creatine kinase into the systemic circulation. Increased creatine kinase can be utilized as a marker to evaluate for the presence and progression of rhabdomyolysis. The abnormal release of myoglobin can cause nephrotoxicity, leading to an acute kidney injury from acute tubular necrosis. Treatment of rhabdomyolysis requires supportive care and intravenous fluid hydration, which assists in the renal clearance of myoglobin, limiting its nephrotoxicity. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E.",
        "C": "Nephrolithiasis typically presents with unilateral flank pain that is colicky and sometimes radiates to the groin with associated hematuria. The common types of nephroliths are calcium oxalate or phosphate, ammonium magnesium phosphate, uric acid, and cystine. On urinalysis, there are typically RBCs without casts. Urinary tract infection (Choice E) can refer to either lower tract (e.g., cystitis, urethritis) or upper tract (e.g., pyelonephritis) infections. It typically presents with dysuria and increased urinary frequency for lower tract infections with the addition of fever, nausea, and flank pain with costovertebral angle tenderness for pyelonephritis.

Smudge cells are a characteristic finding on peripheral blood smear, along with marked lymphocytosis on laboratory evaluation. CLL may also result in an increased risk for recurrent sinopulmonary bacterial infections, as the monoclonal propagation of nonfunctional B lymphocytes most commonly results in hypogammaglobulinemia.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Choledocholithiasis refers to the presence of a gallstone located within the common bile duct. This can result in varying degrees of obstruction, which dictates the severity of presenting symptoms. Obstructive choledocholithiasis results in colicky right upper quadrant or epigastric pain (biliary colic), nausea, vomiting, and increased direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Direct hyperbilirubinemia can lead to scleral icterus and jaundice. Depending on the location of the common bile duct stone, choledocholithiasis can result in acute pancreatitis, which manifests with epigastric pain and increased pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase). If acute bacterial infection of the biliary tree ensues, this can lead to fever and acute cholangitis. The primary treatment for choledocholithiasis is an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy, followed by cholecystectomy. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Alcoholism (Choice A) is a common cause of acute pancreatitis, which can result in epigastric pain and increased amylase, although would be unlikely to result in direct hyperbilirubinemia. Cholecystitis (Choice B) results from obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone with resultant bacterial infection of the gallbladder, and presents with right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. It would not typically present with increased liver function tests or pancreatic enzymes. Hepatoma (Choice D), also known as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), can present with right upper quadrant tenderness and hepatomegaly with associated hepatic enzyme (AST/ALT) and a-fetoprotein elevation. The main risk factors for HCC are cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B infection. Pancreatic carcinoma (Choice E) often presents with nonspecific symptoms such as chronic abdominal pain radiating to the back, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weight loss. If the pancreatic carcinoma is located in the pancreatic head/neck region, it can result in painless obstructive jaundice. Pancreatic carcinoma would not typically present with acute abdominal pain or increased pancreatic enzymes. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 43 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 43 . A 57-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse is brought to the emergency department by police after she was found lying in the street. On arrival, she does not respond to noxious stimuli. Her temperature is 38.1° C (100 .6°F) , pulse is 124/min , respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 94/60 mm Hg. Examination shows poor skin turgor . The oral mucosa is dry.

A) Acute glomerulonephritis B Acute tubular necrosis C) Allergic interstitial nephritis D) Glomerulosclerosis E) Pyelonephritis Correct Answer: B. Acute tubular necrosis is a cause of intrinsic acute end-stage kidney disease that is most commonly the result of either ischemic or nephrotoxic insults to the kidney. This patient presents after having been found down with hemodynamic instability and signs of hypovolemia. This increases her risk for ischemic injury to the kidneys secondary to decreased renal blood flow, which can lead to tubular epithelial cell death and sloughing into the lumen of the tubules. This typically results in an initial oliguric phase where the patient is at increased risk for uremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. Following this initial phase, the patient will then enter a polyuric recovery phase characterized by excessive urine production with associated falls in creatinine and risk for hypokalemia. Urinalysis typically demonstrates granular, muddy brown casts. The presence of blood and protein in the urine may indicate an additional underlying pathology in this patient, such as rhabdomyolysis from compression necrosis of muscle caused by prolonged pressure against the ground while unconscious. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Acute glomerulonephritis (Choice A) refers to a variety of glomerular diseases, including nephritic and nephrotic syndromes. Nephritic syndromes typically present with acute end-stage kidney disease with associated hematuria, red blood cell urine casts, and hypertension. Nephrotic syndrome typically presents with excessive proteinuria (greater than 3 g/day), hyperlipidemia, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Allergic interstitial nephritis (Choice C) most commonly presents as a hypersensitivity reaction following exposure to certain medications such as penicillin, diuretics, and sulfonamides.

A) Acute glomerulonephritis B Acute tubular necrosis C) Allergic interstitial nephritis D) Glomerulosclerosis E) Pyelonephritis Correct Answer: B. Acute tubular necrosis is a cause of intrinsic acute end-stage kidney disease that is most commonly the result of either ischemic or nephrotoxic insults to the kidney. This patient presents after having been found down with hemodynamic instability and signs of hypovolemia. This increases her risk for ischemic injury to the kidneys secondary to decreased renal blood flow, which can lead to tubular epithelial cell death and sloughing into the lumen of the tubules. This typically results in an initial oliguric phase where the patient is at increased risk for uremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. Following this initial phase, the patient will then enter a polyuric recovery phase characterized by excessive urine production with associated falls in creatinine and risk for hypokalemia. Urinalysis typically demonstrates granular, muddy brown casts. The presence of blood and protein in the urine may indicate an additional underlying pathology in this patient, such as rhabdomyolysis from compression necrosis of muscle caused by prolonged pressure against the ground while unconscious. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Acute glomerulonephritis (Choice A) refers to a variety of glomerular diseases, including nephritic and nephrotic syndromes. Nephritic syndromes typically present with acute end-stage kidney disease with associated hematuria, red blood cell urine casts, and hypertension. Nephrotic syndrome typically presents with excessive proteinuria (greater than 3 g/day), hyperlipidemia, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Allergic interstitial nephritis (Choice C) most commonly presents as a hypersensitivity reaction following exposure to certain medications such as penicillin, diuretics, and sulfonamides. It can also occur in the setting of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. It typically presents with pyuria, predominantly eosinophilic. Glomerulosclerosis (Choice D) refers to fibrosis of the glomeruli, which can be seen in a variety of glomerular disease, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and diabetic nephropathy. FSGS is a nephrotic syndrome most commonly caused by sickle cell disease, opioid abuse, and HIV, characterized by segmental sclerosis of the glomeruli. Pyelonephritis (Choice E) typically presents with fevers, nausea, vomiting, and flank pain with associated costovertebral angle tenderness on physical examination. This most commonly occurs from ascending urinary tract infections. Urinalysis demonstrates increased WBCs and may contain WBC casts. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 44 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 44 . A 67-year-old man comes to the physician as a new patient to discuss his blood pressure . He brings his medical records , which show a steady increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure over the past 5 years . He takes no medications . He retired from his job as an insurance executive 5 years ago . He is active , exercises three times weekly , and follows a low-cholesterol diet. His blood pressure today is 160/86 mm Hg. Examination shows no other abnormalities . Which of the following is the most critical factor in the etiology of this patient's hypertension? A) Decreased diameter of the vascular lumen B) Decreased vascular coml)liance C) Increased deposition of lipids in arterial smooth muscle D) Increased deposition of lipofuscin in cardiac myocytes E) Increased intimal thickening of the arteries Correct Answer: B. Decreased vascular compliance is the most critical factor in the cause of this patient's hypertension. The patient demonstrates an increased systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg and pulse pressure of 7 4 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure of 86 mm Hg is at the upper limit of normal. Increased pulse pressure can occur in the setting of various pathologies, including aortic regurgitation, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperthyroidism, and decreased aortic compliance. Vascular compliance refers to the association between changes in blood volume and pressure, with a decreased compliance resulting in abnormally increased pressure relative to changes in volume. Atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta result in decreased aortic compliance and are commonly associated with modifiable risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, smoking, and diabetes mellitus, along with nonmodifiable risk factors such as male sex and increased age. This decreased aortic compliance results in hypertension primarily with isolated systolic blood pressure elevation and is commonly seen in older persons. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Decreased diameter of the vascular lumen (Choice A) would result in increased systemic vascular resistance, most commonly associated with cholesterol atheroma buildup (atherosclerosis) resulting in increased intimal thickening of the arteries (Choice E), especially the arterioles. Decreased vascular lumen diameter would also be seen with increased deposition of lipids in the arterial smooth muscle (Choice C). These would result primarily in an elevation of diastolic blood pressure. Increased deposition of lipofuscin in cardiac myocytes (Choice D) is associated with normal aging and would not directly result in progressive hypertension unless concomitant heart failure was also present. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 45 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 45 . A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She feels well and has no history of serious illness. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years and drinks two beers daily. She has a sedentary lifestyle . Her mother underwent bilateral knee replacement at the age of 55 years for severe osteoarthritis . The patient is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 101 kg (223 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m 2 Her pulse • is 64/min , respirations are 18/min , and blood pressure is 148/92 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities . She requests advice about how to prevent osteoarthritis . Which of the following is most likely to decrease this patient's risk for osteoarthritis? A) Abstinence from alcohol B) Regular aerobic exercise C) Weight loss D) Calcium supplementation E) Estrogen replacement therapy at the onset of menopause Correct Answer: C. Weight loss is the most likely modifiable risk factor to decrease this patient's risk for osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a noninflammatory arthropathy secondary to deterioration of articular cartilage, often related to multifactorial causes with an interplay of systemic and local factors. Obesity, defined as a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m 2 is one of the most common risk factors for the development of osteoarthritis. Excess weight results in consistent, increased daily joint stress and degradation of the articular cartilage. Further, humeral factors from adipose cells plus leptin system derangements cause alterations in metabolism of articular cartilage. These factors result in an increased rate of degradation. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Abstinence from alcohol (Choice A) does not directly affect the risk for developing osteoarthritis. Excessive consumption of alcohol does increase the risk for osteoporosis and increases the risk for a patient to become overweight or obese, but it does not itself increase osteoarthritis risk. Regular aerobic exercise (Choice B) does not demonstrate supporting evidence of increased osteoarthritis risk when performed at light to moderate activity levels and with normal joints. While it can indirectly result in decreased osteoarthritis risk through improved fitness levels and weight loss, it does not directly decrease the risk for osteoarthritis. Calcium supplementation (Choice D) and estrogen replacement therapy at the onset of menopause (Choice E) would assist in decreasing the risk for osseous demineralization and osteoporosis development but would not play a role in decreasing the risk for osteoarthritis. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 46 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 46 . A 42-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of the sudden onset of worsening headache and left-sided weakness 1 hour ago . He has no history of serious illness and has not seen a physician for 10 years . He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years and drinks six beers daily. He is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 97 kg (215 lb); BMI is 30 kg/m 2 His pulse is 80/min , and blood pressure is 180/120 mm Hg. • Examination shows mild-to-moderate weakness of the left lower aspect of the face. Muscle strength is decreased in the left upper and left lower extremities . Funduscopic examination shows an arteriovenous ratio of 1 :3 and regions of mild focal spasm of some arterioles. Results of a complete blood count , platelet count, and coagulation studies are within the reference ranges. His serum total cholesterol concentration is 400 mg/dl. A CT scan of the head shows a 1.5 2-cm region of hyperintensity centered at the right putamen ; there is mild surrounding lucency. Which of the following is most likely to decrease this patient's risk for a recurrent stroke of this type? x A) Alcohol cessation B) Smoking cessation C) Weight loss D) Atorvastatin therapy E) Clopidogrel therapy F) Lisinopril therapy Correct Answer: F. Lisinopril therapy is an ACE inhibitor antihypertension medication, which would be the most likely intervention to reduce this patient's risk for recurrent hypertension-associated intraparenchymal hemorrhagic stroke. The patient presents with progressively worsening headache and a focal neurologic deficit, characteristic for an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Emergent noncontrast CT of the head is indicated for evaluation, which in this patient demonstrates a region of hyperdensity in the right putamen, consistent with an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The greatest risk factor for an intraparenchymal hemorrhage is poorly or uncontrolled hypertension. Hypertension most commonly results in hemorrhages within the basal ganglia, cerebellum, thalamus, and/or pons. Initiation of antihypertensive therapy to reduce the patient's blood pressure would decrease his risk for recurrent hemorrhagic stroke.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "D": "Atorvastatin therapy would assist in decreasing the patient's cholesterol, although this would primarily decrease risk for an ischemic stroke, not recurrent hemorrhagic stroke. Clopidogrel therapy (Choice E) would be contraindicated in a patient with a history of hemorrhagic stroke as clopidogrel is an antiplatelet medication that would increase the patient's risk for hemorrhage. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 47 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 47 . A 32-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the physician because of irregular menses for 3 years . Menses occur at 35- to 60-day intervals . Menses previously occurred at regular 28-day intervals . Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago . She has no history of serious illness but has been overweight most of her adult life. She is sexually active with her husband of 3 years and uses condoms consistently . She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 77 kg (170 lb); BMI is 29 kg/m 2 Her blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows moderate coarse hair over the upper lip, chin, and abdomen . Abdominal and pelvic examinations show no abnormalities . Serum • studies show a thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration of 4 µU/ml , 13-hCG concentration of less than 2 mlU/mL , and prolactin concentration of 18 ng/ml . Pelvic ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. In addition to recommending weight loss, which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? A) Oral contraceptive therapy B) Oral medroxyprogesterone therapy C) Oral prednisone therapy D) Oral thyroid therapy E) Depot leuprolide injection Correct Answer: A. Oral contraceptive therapy is the first-line therapy for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in patients who are not attempting to conceive. The patient presents with irregular menses, hirsutism, and increased body weight, without abnormal thyroid or prolactin lab values. This is characteristic for PCOS. PCOS demonstrates excess androgens and can present with polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, oligo/anovulation, or clinical/biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, of which two are required for the diagnosis. The patient demonstrates a normal pelvic ultrasound, although delineation of polycystic ovaries is not required since she exhibits signs of oligo/anovulation and hyperandrogenism. PCOS increases the risk for metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. For patients who are not attempting to conceive, first-line therapy consists of weight loss and treatment with a combination of oral contraceptives and/or metforrnin. If the patient is attempting to conceive, therapy should include weight loss, clomiphene (to improve successful ovulation), and/or metformin. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Oral medroxyprogesterone therapy (Choice B) is a type of contraceptive consisting of only progestin. Progestin administration would not improve the patient's anovulation, which requires the combination effects of estrogen and progestin in oral contraceptives. Additionally, adverse effects of medroxyprogesterone include weight gain and irregular periods, which would not improve the patient's PCOS symptoms. Oral prednisone therapy (Choice C) and oral thyroid therapy (Choice D) are not indicated in the treatment of PCOS. Oral prednisone is indicated in a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, although in this patient the adverse effects of weight gain and metabolic syndrome would be deleterious. Oral thyroid therapy is not indicated given the patient's normal TSH concentration, indicating she is euthyroid. Depot leuprolide injection (Choice E) is a GnRH analog, which serves to downregulate GnRH receptors in the pituitary and results in decreased production of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. Leuprolide is utilized for the treatment of a variety of conditions, including precocious puberty, infertility, and endometriosis. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 48 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 48 . A 57-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after a 3-minute episode of unconsciousness . The patient says that the episode began with an impending sense of feeling ill while watching television . He quickly became confused , swayed in his chair, and fell to the floor. He had no bowel or bladder incontinence during this episode. His mental status spontaneously recovered fully within 3 minutes . He has a 10-year history of hypertension well controlled with hydrochlorothiazide . He had a myocardial infarction 4 years ago . He is 183 cm (6 ft) tall and weighs 95 kg (210 lb); BMI is 29 kg/m 2 His pulse is 86/min , respirations are 12/min , and blood pressure is 124/86 mm Hg. Neurologic and cardiac examinations show normal findings . An ECG shows Q waves in leads 11 , 111 , and aVF. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings? A) Hypoglycemia B) Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia C) Pulmonary embolus D) Seizure E) Transient ischemic attack Correct Answer: B. Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia (VT) refers to the sudden onset of VT, defined as three or more consecutive premature ventricular contractions. This results in a wide QRS complex tachyarrhythmia. Risk factors include underlying structural heart disease, history of coronary artery disease, or myocardial infarction. Nonsustained VT lasts for less than 30 seconds, while sustained VT persists longer than 30 seconds and presents with varying symptoms such as palpitations and syncope. While an episode of VT may be transient, if sustained, it may require treatment with anti-arrhythmic medications or cardioversion. Class one or three antiarrhythmics are the frequent first-line therapy for stable, sustained VT. Synchronized cardioversion may be necessary in cases of unstable, sustained VT, and defibrillation is required for pulseless VT. Syncope in the setting of VT typically persists for the duration of the episode. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E.",
        "A": "Hypoglycemia is a common cause of syncope, most often in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or an underlying insulinoma. Syncope secondary to hypoglycemia requires treatment with dextrose and/or glucagon and would not be expected to spontaneously resolve without treatment. Additionally, the patient does not exhibit risk factors for hypoglycemia, and given his cardiac risk factors, arrhythmogenic syncope is more likely. Pulmonary embolus (PE) (Choice C) can result in syncope in the setting of a massive PE, which would present with tachycardia and hypotension, with possible right heart strain signs on ECG (eg, \"S1Q3T3\" pattern).",
        "E": "Transient ischemic attack is defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without infarction. Transient ischemic attack resulting in syncope does not typically present with a postictal state. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 49 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 49 .

A) Add epoetin alfa to the medication regimen B) Discontinue ceftriaxone and begin physical therapy C) Switch from ceftriaxone to piperacillin and tazobactam therapy D) Switch from he arin to direct thrombin inhibitor therapy E) Switch from heparin to low-molecular-weight heparin therapy CorrectAnswer: D. Switch from heparin to direct thrombin inhibitor therapy is indicated for the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT typically occurs between 5 and 10 days after the initiation of heparin therapy. It results from the development of lgG antibodies against the complex of heparin and platelet factor 4. This complex leads to the activation of platelets, which can cause thrombosis, typically venous, and consumption of platelets. This abnormal activation yields progressively decreasing platelet counts, which typically hit their lowest point at greater than 50% from their initial level. Treatment requires cessation of all heparin-related products (eg, unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin). The patient should be transitioned to a direct thrombin inhibitor or direct factor Xa inhibitor to ensure adequate anticoagulation without worsening the thrombocytopenia. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Add epoetin alfa to the medication regimen (Choice A) would result in increased red blood cell production from the bone marrow, not platelet production. Epoetin alfa is an analog of erythropoietin (EPO). This is commonly utilized in the setting of chronic end-stage kidney disease for the treatment of normocytic anemia from impaired EPO production. Discontinue ceftriaxone and begin physical therapy (Choice B) is not the best option as ceftriaxone is necessary to treat her pneumonia, and it is less likely to cause thrombocytopenia than heparin over this abrupt time course. Switch from ceftriaxone to piperacillin and tazobactam therapy (Choice C) would only be indicated if the patient developed a hospital or ventilator-associated pneumonia, for which broad-spectrum antibiotics are necessary. Rather, this patient presents with community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Ceftriaxone and azithromycin are first-line therapies for CAP. Switch from heparin to low-molecular-weight heparin therapy (Choice E) would cause further worsening of the patient's HIT, as low-molecular-weight heparin is a subtype of heparin and would further propagate the antibody complex formation and activation of platelets. Instead , the patient requires transition to a direct thrombin inhibitor or factor Xa inhibitor for anticoagulation. r-- r \" , r , Answer - explanation not available on NBME website."

Evaluation for osteoporosis occurs through performance of a DEXA scan and is defined as a bone mineral density less than 2.5 standard deviations compared to a young, normal population (T-score). The most common risk factors for the development of osteoporosis are age, smoking, chronic inflammatory disease , corticosteroid use, and estrogen-depleting conditions in women. Osteoporosis is often asymptomatic but increases the risk for fractures, most commonly involving the hip, vertebrae, and distal radius. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation are the first line for treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. Reduction of active osteoporotic risk factors should also be pursued . Weight-bearing exercises are recommended to slow deterioration of bone mineral density. Bisphosphonates (eg, alendronate) inhibit osteoclast activity. They are utilized once an individual is diagnosed with osteoporosis to reduce further loss of bone mineral density.",

Raloxifene (Choice E) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator, which acts as an agonist for positive bony remodeling from increased osteoblast activity.

In adults, it most commonly occurs from direct spread from an adjacent soft tissue infection and less likely from hematogenous seeding of bacteria to that site. In children and intravenous drug users, hematogenous seeding is more common given the propensity for bacteremia and distant seeding of the bacteria to the involved site. In intravenous drug users, S. aureus and Pseudomonas are the two most common pathogens. On imaging, discitis-osteomyelitis can present with destructive changes of the vertebral bone with collapse of the disc space. Given the patient has a systolic murmur and fever in the setting of intravenous drug use, there is the potential he may have infective endocarditis, which would serve as a source of hematogenous bacterial seeding to the vertebral column.",

As a thrombus occludes the cross-sectional area of a deep vein, the valves, which originate from the walls of the veins, become involved in the thrombus either through compression against the wall of the vessel or through incorporation into the thrombus during propagation. When the thrombus resolves, the residual valve may be dysfunctional from damage to the leaflets, annulus, or diameter of the native vessel. This prevents the valve from functioning effectively and results in retrograde venous flow secondary to gravity. Inadequate venous drainage of the lower extremities can result in varicose veins, chronic edema, and stasis dermatitis.",

Further, the patient's ultrasound was normal, without evidence of an obstruction.

Obstruction of lymph channels (Choice C) results in nonpitting edema of the affected extremity, though would be less likely given the patient's anatomically correlated history of a deep venous thrombosis and lack of infectious (eg, filariasis), surgical, malignant, or traumatic history to explain injury to the lymphatic system.

Common symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism are secondary to the patient's resultant hypercalcemia and include recurrent nephrolithiasis, bone pain from osseous resorption, polyuria, dehydration, constipation, and psychiatric disturbances. Polyuria and associated volume depletion are secondary to the direct effects of hypercalcemia on the kidney, which results in renal resistance and lack of response to anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), known as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

This patient presents with a fever and abdominal pain and will require a contrast-enhanced CT scan to further assess the etiology. His creatinine is elevated, which may place him at a higher risk for the development of CIN. To prevent or decrease the patient's risk of CIN, he should receive an intravenous 0.9% saline infusion. Intravenous isotonic fluid administration assists in promoting renal excretion and reducing nephrotoxic effects of iodinated contrast. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Atrial natriuretic peptide (Choice A) may promote diuresis though has not been shown to prevent CIN. Dopamine (Choice B) is considered a nephroprotective inotrope. At low concentrations, it can theoretically increase renal blood flow. It does not have a role in preventing CIN . Furosemide (Choice C) is a loop diuretic, which would result in increased urine production. Loop diuretics had been shown to reduce the risk of CIN when used in conjunction with matched intravenous fluid hydration. Loop diuretics should not be used as a sole preventative measure for CIN as the diuretic may result in hemodynamically significant hypovolemia which could worsen any contrast-associated acute kidney injury. Mannitol (Choice D) is an osmotic diuretic most commonly used to lower intracranial and intraocular pressure in acute elevations. Forced diuresis with mannitol is not currently recommended for the prevention of CIN. ,. \"' , r-- ,. , Medicine Self-Assessment"

Non-suppression of cortisol on overnight dexamethasone suppression test is diagnostic of Cushing syndrome . There are multiple potential etiologies of Cushing syndrome, including pituitary adenoma, adrenal tumor, or ectopic paraneoplastic ACTH secretion (eg, small-cell lung cancer). Along with the increased production of cortisol, Cushing syndrome from an adrenal etiology can also result in increased concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) produced within the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex. Elevated DHEA-S can also occur in the setting of adrenocortical carcinoma and adrenal hyperplasia. Given the increased DHEA-S , the likely etiology is localized to the adrenal gland. To further assess the patient's pathologic production of cortisol, a CT scan of the abdomen would be the next best step in management to investigate the presence of a functional adrenal nodule or hyperplasia.",

MRI of the brain (Choice E) is useful for evaluation of intracranial pathology, including pituitary adenomas.

It is most common in African American females and is often asymptomatic except for lymphadenopathy, with radiographs potentially demonstrating bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and reticulonodular opacities of bilateral lungs. Granulomatous inflammation can result in autonomous production of 1-alpha-hydroxylase , which converts 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 to the active form 1,25- dihydroxy-vitamin D3. This granulomatous expression of the enzyme results in an increased production of active vitamin D3, which leads to increased intestinal absorption of calcium, resulting in hypercalcemia. This vitamin D3- dependent hypercalcemia results in physiologic suppression of parathyroid hormone. Glucocorticoids are the first line therapy for sarcoidosis, which are utilized to suppress the granulomatous inflammation characteristic of the disease.",

In normal sinus rhythm, there is a one-to-one relationship between the P wave and QRS complex, which is not seen in the setting of complete heart block. In fact, there is no relationship between the P and QRS frequencies, with each maintaining its own unique, separate rate per minute.

A lesion located within the anterior and lateral fascicles of the spinal cord white matter would result in injury to the ALS tract and lateral CST. This would result in contralateral loss of fine touch and temperature perception since the primary sensory neuron for the ALS tract decussates within the spinal cord along the ventral white commissure, followed by ascent within the anterolateral tract of the spinal cord. Additionally, there would be findings of ipsilateral motor weakness as motor decussation occurs in the brain stem.

This patient's presentation is consistent with uremic pericarditis in the setting of acute renal failure, as a result of uncontrolled hypertension. Accelerated hypertension (now known as hypertensive emergency) is defined as an abrupt, significant increase in blood pressure resulting in end-organ damage. The brain, retina, heart, vasculature, and kidneys are commonly affected , in this case reflected by vision changes in the setting of acute hypertension. Acutely increased blood pressure can result in end-organ damage to the kidney secondary to glomerular and arteriolar injury, which can sometimes be worsened by abrupt antihypertensive therapy. If severe enough, oliguria with an associated rise in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen can result, leading to symptoms and signs of uremia.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Asthma is characterized by reversible obstruction of the bronchi secondary to hyperreactivity and airway inflammation . Patients present with episodes of wheezing, dry cough, and dyspnea . On physical examination, wheezes are heard, and there is sometimes a component of prolonged expiration relative to inspiration. Chest radiographs are typically normal. Pulmonary function tests may be normal between symptomatic exacerbations but during such episodes demonstrate an obstructive pattern with increased residual volume and total lung capacity. The severity of asthma is graded based on frequency of day- and night-time symptomatic episodes. Intermittent asthma is characterized as symptoms occurring S2 days per week and S2 nights per month and requires as needed short-acting bronchodilators for symptomatic relief. Individuals with mild persistent asthma (such as this patient) exhibit symptoms >2 days per week or >2 nights per month, which requires the addition of daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (eg, fluticasone). Moderate persistent asthma is treated with the addition of long-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists (eg, salmeterol) to the regimen of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and as-needed short acting bronchodilator. Severe persistent asthma is treated with the addition of high-dose corticosteroids to the regimen.",

Salmeterol (Choice C) is a long-acting beta-2 agonist, used in treatment of moderate persistent asthma, working in conjunction with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Theophylline (Choice D) results in bronchodilation through the inhibition of phosphodiesterase. It has a narrow therapeutic window, resulting in significant cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity. It is a late and/or last-line treatment. Tiotropium (Choice E) is a long-acting anti-muscarinic agent resulting in bronchodilation, which is indicated for use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . ,. \"' , r-- r ,,, Exam Section : Item 27 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

It is often initially characterized by nonspecific vague abdominal discomfort or weight loss.

This can result in painless jaundice and/or pancreatitis from obstruction of these ducts. If the pancreatic adenocarcinoma continues to spread and results in infiltration of surround ing abdominal viscera and/or encasement of adjacent neurovascular structures, this can manifest with severe abdominal pain. The nonspecific nature of pancreatic adenocarcinoma's early symptoms creates a diagnostic dilemma , as many benign conditions present similarly.

It presents as inflammation and chronic fibrosis of the biliary tree resulting in a beaded appearance to the biliary tree with multifocal strictures . Symptoms of sclerosing cholangitis include anorexia, nausea , vomiting, and malabsorption.

A) Delirium tremens B Heat stroke 1 C) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome D) Subarachnoid hemorrhage E) Thyroid storm F) Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome Correct Answer: B. Heat stroke is characterized by hyperthermia, altered mental status or neurologic deficits, and variable physical signs and symptoms depending on severity. In this case, this patient was found down, in a hot apartment, presumably from the combined effects of alcohol intoxication and subsequent overheating from the environment. His exam shows tachycardia, hypotension, and warm, flushed skin. His workup reveals hypernatremia, hyperchloremia, hyperkalemia, elevated creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and elevated creatine kinase. This constellation of findings reflects hyperthermia, severe hypovolemia, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, E, and F. Delirium tremens {Choice A) occurs 48-72 hours following cessation of alcohol use in a patient with alcoholism and is characterized by delirium, hallucinations, and autonomic instability. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome {Choice C) occurs secondary to certain classes of medications, such as antipsychotics, and is characterized by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and autonomic instability. Subarachnoid hemorrhage {Choice D) typically presents with an acute-onset, severe headache, and is shown on imaging as hyperdense material {blood) within the subarachnoid space. Thyroid storm {Choice E) presents with hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, diaphoresis, agitation, tremor, nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss, and may progress to high-output heart failure, obtundation, seizure, or coma. It typically occurs in a patient with a known diagnosis of hyperthyroidism following a secondary insult such as infection or physiologic stress from surgery or trauma. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome {Choice F) occurs secondary to thiamine deficiency and is characterized by neurologic symptoms, including confusion, nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia, followed by dementia and psychosis. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 41 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment 41 . A 32-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of swelling of his left hand and redness of his left forearm , wrist , and hand after being involved in a grease fire while working at a restaurant yesterday. After emptying the fryers , a small amount of grease splattered and left small burns on his arms . He does not take any medications. He has a history of \"abnormal liver tests\" and condylomata acuminata . He has had multiple sexual partners during the past 10 years and does not use condoms . His temperature is 38.8°C (101 .9°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 138/68 mm Hg. A photograph of the left upper extremity is shown . There is no crepitus or fluctuance . Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities . Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 18,000/mm 3 with a left shift . X-rays of the left hand show diffuse soft-tissue edema . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Brown recluse spider bite B) Disseminated gonococcal infection C) Erysipelas D) Fasciitis E) Gout F) LymRhangitis G) Sporotrichosis Correct Answer: F. Lymphangitis refers to inflammation or infection of the lymphatic channels, which often occurs secondary to an infectious source at a location distal to the lymphatic channel, in this case correlating with the location of the patient's burns. The most common cause of lymphangitis is Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A), with Sporothrix schenckii representing the most common fungal lymphangitis. Clinically, it presents with erythema in a linear, longitudinal band appearance, which correlates with the associated lymphatic drainage channel. There is also typically painful lymphadenopathy along the associated lymphatic drainage channel. This can result in pain and swelling with the possibility for high fevers. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, E, and G. Brown recluse spider bites {Choice A) are associated with dermatonecrosis due to cytotoxic venom. Systemic illness is possible, more common in children, elderly, and chronically ill individuals, which can manifest with fever, rashes, and myalgias, and rarely, disseminated intravascular coagulation and end-organ damage. Disseminated gonococcal infection {Choice B) presents with pustular skin lesions, migratory polyarthralgia, and tenosynovitis. Erysipelas {Choice C) results from infection of the upper dermis and superficial lymphatics, most commonly from S. pyogenes, and on exam appears as a well-defined region of raised induration and erythema. Fasciitis {Choice D) refers to infection spreading along a deep fascial plane, most commonly from mixed flora (anaerobic and aerobic bacteria). It typically presents with acute onset of pain, which progresses to anesthesia, at a site of prior trauma or surgery. Evidence of gas production (crepitus), bullae, and severe pain out of proportion to the physical exam are indications of a necrotizing infection. Gout {Choice E) refers to monosodium urate crystals resulting in inflammatory monoarticular arthritis, classically the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Joint fluid analysis shows needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals, with the possibility for erosive changes of underlying cortical bone. Sporotrichosis {Choice G) results from infection by Sporothrix schenckii, a fungus, which grows within the rosettes of conidia plants and is typically introduced through traumatic breakage of the skin (eg, thorn). This results in a local pustule and ulcer formation, with an ascending lymphangitis. The patient's injury was not secondary to injury from vegetation, limiting the likelihood of sporotrichosis as the causative agent for the lymphangitis. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 42 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

While recommendations for lipid levels vary by recommending organization, general recommendations for individuals with diabetes mellitus center around a target LDL <100 mg/dl, HDL >40 mg/dl, and triglycerides <150 mg/dl. Patients with diabetes mellitus exhibit a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease, with increased morbidity and mortality secondary to macrovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease, and stroke. It is critical to implement lipid-lowering agents to achieve target ranges for lipoprotein levels. Treatment of LDL cholesterol levels is considered the first priority for pharmacologic therapy.

When ingested, the histamine triggers a reaction variably presenting with flushing, urticaria, wheezing, itchiness, blurry vision, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and headache. In severe cases, it can present similarly to anaphylaxis. In this case, the mahimahi may have been improperly stored, leading to the accumulation of the histamine.",

        "B": "Refrigerating the cream puff might reduce the likelihood of S. aureus toxin-mediated diarrhea, but this would not fully or accurately explain the patient's symptoms. Reheated rice syndrome (Choice C) is occasionally seen due to infection from B. cereus, though typically presents with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Unwashed leafy greens (Choice D) or berries (Choice E) could expose the patient to bacteria, fungi, viruses, or chemical contaminants, all of which would present with primarily gastrointestinal symptoms. ,. \"' , r-- r ,,, Exam Section : Item 48 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment 48 . Twenty-four hours after nearly drowning, a 24-year-old man in the intensive care unit has not regained consciousness . He was resuscitated at the scene and was intubated and mechanically ventilated en route to the emergency department. In the emergency department , his Po was 80 mm Hg on an F10 of 30% . An x-ray of the 2 2 chest showed no abnormalities . Now, his temperature is 37.2°C (99°F) , pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 121/60 mm Hg. His respirations are 14/min on the ventilator. Examination shows no edema . Coarse airway sounds are heard on auscultation ; there are no crackles . Heart sounds are distant with no gallops . Laboratory studies show: Leukocyte count 8500/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Lymphocytes 20% Serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dL Arterial blood gas analysis on an F10 of 100% and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 20 cm Hp shows : 2 7.42 38 mm Hg 60 mm Hg An x-ray of the chest is shown . Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current x-ray findings? A) Acute resRiratory distress syndrome B) Bronchiolitis obliterans C) Congestive heart failure D) Diffuse interstitial pneumonia E) Idiopathic interstitial fibrosis Correct Answer: A. Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in response to many etiologies, most commonly infectious, inflammatory, and traumatic. The syndrome results from the effect of cytokines on the pulmonary parenchyma from direct or indirect lung injury. This results in endothelial injury with exudative fluid extending into the alveolar space, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. On chest radiographs, this is characterized by diffuse reticular and airspace opacification. In the case of drowning, aspirated fluid causes local inflammation in the lung, along with the dilution of surfactant, leading to impaired compliance and airspace infiltration. This can result in persistent hypoxia despite rising positive end-expiratory pressure and increased fraction of inspired oxygen. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Bronchiolitis obliterans (Choice B) is characterized by chronic inflammation in the bronchioles and, in some cases, alveoli, which leads to deposition of connective tissue and can show an obstructive lung disease pattern on spirometry. Congestive heart failure (Choice C) results from increased filling pressures or impaired forward flow in the heart. This increases hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary venous circulation, resulting in transudation of fluid from the pulmonary capillaries into the alveolar space, impairing gas exchange. It is not the most likely etiology in a previously healthy young person without cardiomegaly on chest x-ray and a more likely explanation related to recent drowning. Diffuse interstitial pneumonia (Choice D) commonly presents with infectious or inflammatory symptoms such as fever and cough productive of sputum, along with infiltrates on chest x-ray. This patient is afebrile and had a normal chest x-ray on arrival that became abnormal during the hospital course, suggesting that prior to presentation he had been healthy. Idiopathic interstitial fibrosis (Choice E), also known as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is a restrictive lung disease that often presents in older smokers, resulting in chronic and progressive shortness of breath. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 49 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Pulmonary contusions may occur after blunt or penetrating trauma to the chest. They often underlie the region of trauma to the chest wall and result from damage to capillaries with associated leakage of intravascular and extravascular fluid into the pulmonary interstitium and alveolar airspaces, respectively. This can result in hypoxia if it involves and compromises a large enough region of the lung. On chest radiographs, pulmonary contusions appear as interstitial infiltrates and/or patchy alveolar opacities. The extent and distribution depend on the mechanism, location, and force of trauma to the chest wall. Management of pulmonary contusions is supportive with control of pain, pulmonary toilet, lung expansion, and maintenance of adequate ventilation/oxygenation of the patient.",

        "A": "Fat embolism typically occurs following a long-bone fracture with resultant fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia, petechiae, and conjunctiva! hemorrhage. Flail chest (Choice B) generally results when two or more adjacent ribs are fractured at two or more locations, which results in paradoxical movement of that particular segment of the chest wall. Pulmonary edema (Choice D) often occurs secondary to a hypervolemic state (eg, heart failure, renal failure, cirrhosis) or inflammatory state (eg, pneumonia , acute respiratory distress syndrome) and can present with tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia, cough, respiratory distress, and interstitial and/or alveolar opacities. Pulmonary thromboembolism (Choice E) presents with tachycardia, tachypnea, and pleuritic chest pain, and is unlikely to be related to trauma acutely, though can result from prolonged immobilization following trauma if a thrombus develops and embolizes. ,. \"' , r-- r ,,, Exam Section : Item 50 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"
