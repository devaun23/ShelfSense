      "correct_answer_explanation": "Bacterial overgrowth results from abnormal growth of bacteria in the small intestine, which disrupts normal digestion of macromolecules. Patients present with recurrent nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, weight loss, loose stools, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Bacterial overgrowth classically occurs in patients with previous history of abdominal surgeries, resection of the ileocecal valve, creation of blind loops, or following prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors. This is caused by the loss of normal intestinal peristalsis, retrograde translocation, or disruption of acidic pH as means of limiting bacterial presence or promoting bacterial elimination in the small bowel. The increased metabolism from bacteria, their colonization of the bowel wall, and disruption of normal gut flora contribute to malabsorption and resultant symptoms. Bacterial overgrowth occurs more frequently in patients with blind or limited-transit intestinal loops created during procedures such as the Billroth II or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, resulting from the loss of passing food bolus which allows for appropriate anterograde propulsion of bacteria along the gastrointestinal tract. Patients may see improvement in symptoms following administration of antibiotics, which decreases bacterial burden.",

        "B": "Bile reflux occurs when bile travels retrograde through the pylorus and into the stomach or esophagus, causing symptoms of nausea and heartburn. COX-2 inhibition (Choice C) may result in the development of peptic ulcers because of the loss of mucosal barrier protection; peptic ulcers typically present with abdominal pain, nausea, and occasional vomiting or darkened stools. Neither bile reflux nor peptic ulcer disease are associated with loose stools and increased stool frequency. Dumping syndrome (Choice D) occurs because of rapid gastric emptying into the duodenum and often presents with abdominal pain and cramping. It would be unlikely to improve with the administration of antibiotics. Efferent loop obstruction (Choice E) refers to mechanical obstruction of the efferent jejunal limb of intestine following a gastric reconstruction procedure and presents with symptoms of small bowel obstruction, not increased stool frequency. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 3 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Pneumothorax results from air entering the intrapleural space from either an external (e.g., stab wound) or internal (e.g., ruptured bleb or bronchus, bronchopleural fistula) source. As the air accumulates within the space, the lung parenchyma becomes compressed, resulting in reduced breath sounds, respiratory distress, and, in severe cases, tension on the mediastinal structures impeding venous return. In cases of acute trauma, evacuating the accumulated air permits expansion of the lung and elimination of tension on the great vessels; this is done through needle decompression in cases of tension pneumothorax, tube thoracostomy, or both. Once a tube thoracostomy is placed and healing of the inciting injury occurs, leakage of air into the pleural space should stop. If a persistent air leak is noted, the source of the leak should be investigated. A ruptured bronchus requires extended time to heal and is one source of a potential air leak. If the leak persists, surgical correction of the rupture may be required to prevent chronic pneumothorax from a resultant bronchopleural fistula. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, and D. Esophageal injury (Choice A) can result in pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax, and, if severe, bacterial mediastinitis can occur. While diminished breath sounds may occur in the setting of an esophageal injury, additional findings such as mediastinal crepitus, crunching on auscultation, and signs of sepsis would likely be present. Open pneumothorax (Choice B) would be detected on examination as a penetrating wound in continuity with the pleural space. Tension pneumothorax (Choice D) occurs when air accumulates within the pleural cavity to an extent that results in compression and shifting of the mediastinal structures. Such structural compromise results in impaired venous return leading to diminished cardiac output. It typically presents as severe respiratory distress, jugular venous distention, tracheal deviation, diminished breath sounds, hyperresonance to percussion, and hemithorax hyperinflation. Vital signs will show tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 4 of 50 'I",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Crohn disease is characterized by transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, most frequently involving the terminal ileum. It can arise anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract and is a subclass of inflammatory bowel disease. Most patients experience chronic abdominal cramping, bloody diarrhea, and weight loss. Examination often demonstrates generalized abdominal tenderness, sometimes worse in the right lower quadrant, and depending on the severity and extent, may disclose complications such as enterocutaneous fistulas and extraintestinal manifestations such as uveitis. Severe Crohn disease can result in intestinal obstruction from stricture or inflammation, bowel perforation, intra-abdominal abscess, and the formation of additional fistulas. Diagnosis occurs through imaging and biopsy. Laboratory analyses often show increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. On fluoroscopic small bowel follow-through, narrowing of the intestinal lumen at the terminal ileum is commonly seen, along with other sites of strictures or fistulous formation. Treatment is through anti-inflammatory medications, immunomodulators, and glucocorticoids, with complicated, severe cases sometimes requiring surgery such as small bowel resection or colectomy. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Amebic enteritis {Choice A) presents with crampy abdominal pain, watery or bloody diarrhea, and abdominal distention. When severe or complicated, hepatitis, hepatic abscesses, intestinal ulceration, or perforation may occur. Exposure occurs from ingestion of contaminated water containing cysts of the amoeba (typically Entamoeba histolytica) often in areas with poor sanitation or insecure water supply. Leiomyosarcoma {Choice C) is a rare malignancy of smooth muscle that most commonly occurs in the abdomen or uterus; lesions do not typically present with intermittent diarrhea and are generally not associated with regional enteritis. Necrotizing enterocolitis {Choice D) is classically associated with premature infancy and is characterized by inflammation and necrosis of the bowel wall. It is treated with intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest, and if complicated by perforation, may require surgical resection. It is rare in adults. Recurrent intussusception {Choice E) describes telescoping of one segment of bowel into another, which can cause intestinal ischemia or obstruction. It is typically because of a pathologic lead point (e.g., malignancy, stricture, lymphadenopathy), and presents with colicky pain and bloating. It more commonly presents in children. The small bowel follow-through examination does not demonstrate telescoping of bowel segments. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 9 of 50 'I",

Intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy (Choice C) does not have a commonly recognized role in the treatment of subdural hematoma, although magnesium is often deficient in patients with alcohol use disorder and repletion may be required, especially in cases of concomitantly low potassium. Lumbar puncture (Choice D) is contraindicated in the setting of an intracranial mass lesion because of the associated increased intracranial pressure and theoretical risk for cerebellar tonsillar herniation. r \" , r-- r , 'I 11 . Six hours after sigmoid colectomy and colostomy for perforated diverticulitis , a 62-year-old woman has had a total postoperative urine output of 65 ml through a Foley catheter. Preoperatively , the patient had a serum urea nitrogen concentration of 45 mg/dl and a serum creatinine concentration of 2 mg/dl. She has been receiving 0.45% saline at 90 ml/h since the operation . She is 157 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 60 kg (132 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m 2 Her pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. Her serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference range , and urine specific gravity is 1.028. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Measurement of creatinine clearance B) Intravenous pyelography C) Renal perfusion scan D) Rapid administration of 500 ml of 0.9% saline E) Administration of intravenous fluids to replace insensible fluid losses only F) Administration of intravenous fluids to replace urine output only CorrectAnswer: D. Physiologically, one of the first detectable aspects of hypovolemic shock is declining urine output. As a result of normal compensatory mechanisms, the kidney begins to retain fluid when intravascular volume falls. This occurs through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which causes retention of sodium and water, along with the increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) when volume losses are excessive. Retention of fluid permits maintenance of hemodynamics until such losses result in insufficient compensation, which in early shock states permits the heart rate, blood pressure, and signs of perfusion (e.g., capillary refill, pulse pressure) to remain normal. Appropriate urine output levels in homeostatic euvolemia are generally 0.5 to 1.0 ml/kg/hour. An adult patient of average body mass should excrete 35 to 70 ml/hour when euvolemic. A total of 65 ml of urine output, six hours after a surgery in which fluid and blood losses and third spacing likely occurred, suggests a clinically significant hypovolemia. The best initial treatment is replacement of volume using 0.9% saline. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, E, and F. Measurement of creatinine clearance {Choice A) would not assist in the immediate resuscitation of this patient, who has an objective physiologic parameter (urine output) indicating early compensated shock. Intravenous pyelography {Choice B) would be useful in the diagnosis of obstructive hydroureteronephrosis as a cause of low urine output. It is not the most likely cause in a patient presenting after surgery for an intraperitoneal pathology, as the ureters and kidneys are retroperitoneal structures. Renal perfusion scan {Choice C) is used to evaluate blood flow to the kidney; apart from unexpected surgical complication, it would not be the most likely cause of falling urine output in the postoperative state for an unrelated procedure. Administration of intravenous fluids to replace insensible fluid losses only {Choice E) and administration of intravenous fluids to replace urine output only {Choice F) would not sufficiently resuscitate the patient, as replacement of previous losses is required to compensate for the total volume deficit in addition to ongoing losses. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 12 of 50 'I"

    "explanation": {
      "correct_answer_explanation": "Ventilatory insufficiency arises because of derangement in the neurologic, metabolic, or motor drivers of respiration. Ventilation is a complex process driven by the somatic and autonomic nervous systems and requires an intact central nervous system without dysfunction of the brain stem, spinal cord, or efferent nerves (e.g., phrenic, intercostal). It also requires an unobstructed airway, unrestricted and semirigid chest wall, normal neuromuscular function, normal circulatory function , and normal pulmonary parenchymal and stromal function. Derangement within any part of this process can result in insufficient ventilation. Spinal anesthesia can reduce neuromuscular function distal to the level of the block. In turn, insufficient rate or depth of ventilation will result in retained carbon dioxide and development of acute respiratory acidosis. Acute respiratory acidosis typically demonstrates a decrease in pH with increased PCO on arterial blood gas. Hypoxia may be present. With cessation of neuromuscular blockade, respiratory mechanics should return to baseline, and result in 2 progressive resolution of the acid-base disturbance. In severe or complicated cases, ventilatory support may be required.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Fluid overload presents with symptoms of shortness of breath and weight gain, and on physical examination, patients may demonstrate tachypnea, tachycardia, hypertension, hypoxia, jugular venous distention, lower extremity edema, crackles in the lung fields, and an S heart sound . Fluid overload classically occurs in a patient with heart, liver, or renal failure. It would be unlikely to follow spinal anesthesia without 3 preceding symptoms and would generally exclude a patient from elective surgery. lntraoperative myocardial infarction (Choice B) is a known complication of many surgeries as a consequence of physiologic stress, blood loss, and the proinflammatory state of surgery; it presents with chest pain , shortness of breath , and specific T wave, ST-segment, or Q wave changes on ECG. However, if the patient is under general anesthesia, the diagnosis would depend on ECG changes. Metabolic acidosis (Choice C) is demonstrated on arterial blood gas analysis as low pH and low PCO along with low bicarbonate. It can present with or without an anion gap, which helps elucidate the cause of the 2 metabolic acidosis. Common causes include lactic acidosis, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and diarrhea. Total sympathetic blockade (Choice D) is a potential complication of anesthesia; however, it would be unlikely to cause hypoventilation at the thoracic level as blockade of the brain stem would be required. Additionally, total sympathetic blockade typically presents with hypotension, bradycardia, depressed respiratory drive, and miosis. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 13 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency are associated with chronic pancreatitis and result from repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis leading to the destruction of acinar and islet cells. The exocrine pancreas produces digestive enzymes, the absence of which leads to malnutrition (e.g., cachexia, muscle wasting), weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and frequent, loose, foul-smelling, sometimes oily stools (steatorrhea). The endocrine pancreas produces insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin. The loss of endogenous insulin leads to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, with symptoms including polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia. The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic insufficiency is through clinical history, imaging, and biopsy. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is treated with oral pancreatic enzyme replacement, and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus caused by the loss of pancreatic insulin requires insulin replacement. Any modifiable inciting causes of pancreatitis (e.g., gallstones, alcohol abuse, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia) should be mitigated to delay disease progression and preserve remaining native pancreatic function. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F.

Exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency are associated with chronic pancreatitis and result from repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis leading to the destruction of acinar and islet cells. The exocrine pancreas produces digestive enzymes, the absence of which leads to malnutrition (e.g., cachexia, muscle wasting), weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and frequent, loose, foul-smelling, sometimes oily stools (steatorrhea).

Bacterial overgrowth (Choice A) results from abnormal growth of bacteria in the small intestine, which disrupts normal digestion of macromolecules. Patients present with recurrent nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, weight loss, and malabsorption. Bacterial overgrowth classically occurs in patients with a previous history of abdominal surgeries, resection of the ileocecal valve, creation of blind loops, or following prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors. Celiac disease (Choice B), a gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an immunologic intolerance to the protein gliadin. Celiac disease typically presents with abdominal discomfort, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea following exposure to gluten and may be associated with weight loss and dermatitis herpetiformis. Cystic fibrosis (Choice C) is a hereditary chloride channelopathy that results in thickened bronchial and gastrointestinal mucous secretions, leading to chronic infection, inflammation, and malabsorption. It can result in pancreatic insufficiency, although this would be unlikely given the patient's risk factors for chronic pancreatitis and lack of concordant findings to suggest cystic fibrosis. Hemochromatosis (Choice D) presents with liver failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, arthritis, heart failure, darkening of the skin, and gonadal atrophy secondary to excess total body iron. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Choice F) is often asymptomatic but generally occurs in overweight, sedentary persons because of impaired insulin sensitivity. It is usually associated with weight gain and metabolic syndrome as a precursor condition. Gastrointestinal symptoms as a primary presentation are less likely. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 14 of 50 'I",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) commonly presents with symptoms of hearing loss, vertigo, and ataxia, often slow in onset and progressive over a subacute to chronic period. Classically, these tumors occur at the cerebellopontine angle of the brain stem and are associated with neurofibromatosis. They may exert mass effect on cranial nerves within their proximity or invade the nerves from which they arise, often the facial nerve, vestibulocochlear nerve, or adjacent nerves. Facial nerve involvement manifests as facial asymmetry caused by loss of skeletal muscle innervation, and occasionally presents with diminished taste perception involving the ipsilateral anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Vestibulocochlear nerve palsy can present with diminished hearing or tinnitus (cochlear branch) on the ipsilateral side, and vertigo or ataxia may occur (vestibular branch) because of impaired proprioception from loss of input from the ipsilateral vestibule. In cases of larger masses, disruption of brain stem tracts and increased intracranial pressure can result.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Basilar artery thrombosis classically presents as an acute posterior circulation neurologic deficit from in situ formation or embolic spread of an occlusive thrombus. Symptoms include cranial nerve deficits such as nystagmus, diplopia, dysarthria, vertigo, dysphagia, nausea and vomiting, occipital lobe-related vision loss, and occasional long-tract dysfunction leading to sensorimotor deficits.",
        "C": "Cholesteatoma presents with mild, moderate, or severe conductive hearing loss, and occasionally presents with ipsilateral pain if the lesion has invaded surrounding structures. Pontine hematoma (Choice D) may present with acute neurologic deficits most commonly involving the trigeminal nerve, the abducens nerve, or the facial nerve; impaired coordination; ataxic gait; or locked-in syndrome. It classically occurs because of a hemorrhagic stroke as a result of chronic, poorly controlled hypertension. Temporal lobe mass (Choice E) can present with seizures, loss of function related to speech or hearing, or with headaches; such a mass would less likely result in ataxia or impairments in coordination. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 15 of 50 The response options for the next 2 items are the same .

The patient is hemodynamically stable, but blood is oozing from every surface in the operative field and from the\nintravenous and arterial catheter sites.\nCorrect Answer: F.\nThrombocytopenia can be genetic or acquired. The quantity of platelets and their qualitative function are both important in primary hemostasis. In cases of massive transfusion, imbalances in blood composition can occur if\nplasma or platelets are not replaced along with packed red blood cells.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Esophageal perforation can occur from multiple causes including forceful vomiting (Boerhaave syndrome), trauma, invasive malignancy, and inflammation. Translocation of gastric contents into the mediastinum can cause rapidly progressive infection and sepsis from mediastinitis. If not appropriately treated with antibiotics and source control, mediastinitis can be fatal. Esophageal perforation is a surgical emergency and is diagnosed through water-soluble contrast esophagography. It is treated with surgical repair via exploratory thoracotomy, which allows mediastinal washout and repair of the defect.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Esophagoscopy is an alternative method of diagnosing a perforated esophagus via direct visualization, but because of insufflation and advancement of an endoscope through the esophagus, this method runs the risk for worsening the perforation. Exploratory celiotomy (laparotomy) (Choice B) may have a role if the esophageal perforation is inferior to the esophageal hiatus; however, the diagnostic testing performed on this patient discloses a proximal defect into the mediastinum. This would be better accessed for definitive repair with an exploratory thoracotomy. CT scan of the chest (Choice D) is a potential alternative diagnostic method if the patient is unable to participate in the swallowing necessary for an esophagography, but it is likely to miss small perforations and defects in the esophagus. Esophagography with a water-soluble contrast is much more sensitive and specific to evaluate an esophageal perforation. Tube thoracostomy (Choice E) is appropriate to diagnose and treat pleural effusions and pneumothoraces; however, it would not permit source control and repair in cases of esophageal rupture. This patient does exhibit a left-sided pleural effusion; however, it is secondary to the esophageal perforation, which should be diagnosed and treated first. A thoracostomy may have an adjunct role in preventing empyema from the resultant pleural effusion but is not the primary means of treatment for the esophageal perforation. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 19 of 50 'I"

Sedatives such as opiates, ketamine, benzodiazepines, and etomidate are not associated with MH, nor are curare-based paralytics (e.g., rocuronium). MH classically occurs because of a mutation in the skeletal myocyte ryanodine receptor type 1; activation of this receptor permits rapid and uncontrolled calcium efflux from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, with resultant uncontrolled depolarization. A hypermetabolic state ensues with signs and symptoms including agitation, diaphoresis, hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, and muscle rigidity. Complications include hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis. MH is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and can present similarly to neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome. Treatment requires discontinuation of the offending agent and rapid administration of dantrolene, which prevents calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Intravenous fluid, benzodiazepines, antipyretics, and cooling blankets have a supportive role. With treatment, the mortality rate is less than 10%.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Renal artery stenosis is a cause of secondary hypertension related to abnormal stimulation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus from low afferent blood flow leading to excessive production of renin and angiotensin. The reduced afferent blood flow can also result in progressive renal atrophy. Secondary hypertension should be considered in new-onset or treatment-resistant hypertension, or in patients with predisposing features such as known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (e.g., coronary artery disease). There are two main causes of renal artery stenosis: fibromuscular dysplasia and atherosclerosis. In younger patients, fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause, while older patients develop renal artery stenosis more commonly from atherosclerosis. Diagnosis is established with renal artery Doppler ultrasonography or magnetic resonance angiography, which can quantify the degree of renal artery stenosis and renal atrophy. Treatment involves angioplasty or stenting of the stenosed renal artery to improve flow. ACE inhibitors can be considered for unilateral stenosis but can lead to acute kidney injury in the setting of bilateral renal artery stenosis.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Adenomyosis is the presence of glandular endometrial tissue in the myometrium, and generally presents with abnormal uterine bleeding and pelvic pain. It most commonly occurs in a multigravid woman, often in her fourth or fifth decade of life. On examination, a large, boggy uterus may be palpated. Corpus luteum cysts (Choice B) occur as a normal feature of the menstrual cycle; once a follicle matures and releases an ovum, the residual tissue becomes known as the corpus luteum, a structure that produces estrogen and progesterone in support of a potential conception. If fertilization and implantation does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates. In some cases, they can fill with fluid or blood, resulting in the formation of a cyst, which is typically visible on ultrasonography.",
        "D": "Endometrioma denotes a cyst on the ovary resulting from ectopic endometrial tissue implantation. They progressively increase in size, often concordant with the menstrual cycle, and exhibit recurrent bleeding into the cyst, which is a hallmark for diagnosis on imaging.",
        "E": "Endometriosis denotes the presence of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus, and classically presents with symptoms of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and dyschezia. The gold-standard for diagnosis is a diagnostic laparoscopy, which evaluates for endometriotic implant lesions on the peritoneum. Follicular cyst (Choice F) is the most common type of ovarian cyst and describes an unruptured follicle, or one that has ruptured but remains filled with simple fluid. They are generally asymptomatic when small but may result in pelvic pain or pressure when large. They do not carry any risk for ovarian neoplasm. Leiomyomata uteri (Choice G), also known as uterine fibroids, are benign neoplasms of uterine myometrium. They are a potential cause of abnormal uterine bleeding and pelvic pain and are typically visible on ultrasonography. They are the most common indication for hysterectomy. Pelvic inflammatory disease (Choice H) is a common risk factor for future ectopic pregnancy and presents with pelvic pain, cervicovaginal discharge, fever, and cervical motion, uterine, and/or adnexal tenderness secondary to bacterial infection. Common pathogens include enteric flora, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Ruptured ovarian cyst (Choice I) can present with severe abdominal pain and focal peritoneal signs; however, the cyst is typically visible on ultrasonography with surrounding simple fluid from the rupture. This is a less likely cause of the patient's presentation, as ruptured ovarian cysts do not typically result in hemorrhagic shock. Spontaneous abortion (Choice J) presents with vaginal bleeding, abdominal or pelvic pain, and an open or closed cervical os. While vaginal bleeding may be present, this does not typically result in hemorrhagic shock, which makes an ectopic pregnancy more likely to explain this patient's presentation. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 22 of 50 'I"

Damage to the roots or to the nerve along its course (e.g., in the cubital tunnel) can result in motor dysfunction of the fingers and numbness or paresthesia involving the medial aspect of the upper extremity.

Myocardial infarction can present nonspecifically but classically occurs with shortness of breath, chest pain, light-headedness, nausea, vomiting, or altered mental status, and may be complicated by cardiogenic shock, seen as tachycardia, hypotension, and impaired end-organ perfusion (cool extremities, low urine output). In postoperative cases, especially with intubated patients, it may be difficult to assess the presence of myocardial infarction. Evaluation using ECG, serial troponin assays, and echocardiogram should be considered in such cases. Right-heart catheterization can be used to determine cardiac output and index, along with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which can distinguish right heart failure from left heart failure.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Mitral stenosis is classically heard as an opening snap, followed by a diastolic rumble, loudest over the cardiac apex and radiating to the axilla. Mitral stenosis occurs because of calcification and fibrosis of the mitral valve. Impaired excursion of the valve leaflets results in increased left atrial filling pressures and impaired diastolic filling of the left ventricle. The resulting elevation in left atrial pressure can result in left atrial enlargement and potential pulmonary edema. The fixed obstruction to blood flow may manifest with signs of heart failure such as shortness of breath, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and impaired exercise tolerance. Chronic rheumatic disease is a key risk factor for the development of the condition. Treatment is through medical optimization followed by surgical valve replacement if severe.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Aortic regurgitation presents with an early diastolic decrescendo murmur heard best in the right second intercostal space, and is most commonly associated with endocarditis, acute rheumatic fever, and aortic root dilation. Aortic stenosis (Choice B) presents with a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur that is heard best at the upper right sternal border and radiates to the carotid arteries. It classically occurs secondary to age-related fibrotic and calcific changes of the valve but can occur earlier in life in cases of bicuspid aortic valve or chronic rheumatic disease. Atrial septal defect (Choice C) is a defect in the interatrial septum. The most common type is an ostium secundum defect, although ostium primum defects are commonly associated with trisomy 21. The atrial septal defect results in a left-to-right shunt with abnormal flow of blood from the left atrium to the right atrium, resulting in relative volume overload of the right atrium and ventricle, which presents as a fixed, split S and low 2 grade physiologic ejection murmur on cardiac auscultation. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (Choice D) classically presents with a systolic murmur loudest in the lower left sternal border, which is quieter with increased preload and afterload. It is secondary to hypertrophy of the interventricular septum, creating an outflow obstruction within the left ventricular outflow tract. It classically presents with syncope or sudden cardiac death in an exercising young athlete with a potential family history of a similar event. Mitral regurgitation (Choice E) presents with a holosystolic murmur that is heard best in the left fourth or fifth intercostal space along the midclavicular line and radiates to the left axilla. It is commonly associated with mitral valve prolapse or prior myocardial infarction. Pulmonic stenosis (Choice G) presents with a systolic murmur heard best in the second left intercostal region, which is also often crescendo-decrescendo, though quieter and with less radiation to the lower neck because of the lower pressure in the pulmonary circulation. Ventricular septal defect (Choice H) is characterized by a holosystolic murmur heard best in the lower left sternal border. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 28 of 50 'I"

        "A": "Gastric mucosal irritation due to an enterovirus infection describes viral gastritis, a common cause of epigastric and left upper quadrant discomfort, nausea, and vomiting, that is generally self-limited. Symptoms of a gastric outlet obstruction would not be expected. Mucosal action of ingested heat-stable enterotoxins (Choice B) describes the mechanism of traveler's diarrhea because of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Heat stable toxin from ETEC binds guanylate cyclase, resulting in downstream effects of electrolyte and water loss from the mucosal cells. Patients typically experience nausea, cramping, abdominal bloating, and profuse, watery diarrhea. Perforation of a duodenal diverticulum (Choice C) may lead to severe, diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, high fever, tachycardia, and septic shock. Bowel contents in the peritoneal space cause rapid infection in the form of peritonitis marked by abdominal rigidity, rebound tenderness, and guarding; perforated viscus and resultant peritonitis is a surgical emergency requiring exploratory laparotomy. Thrombosis of the superior mesenteric artery (Choice E) describes the pathophysiology of acute mesenteric ischemia, which presents with acute, severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea, often in a patient with atrial fibrillation, splanchnic atherosclerosis, or a hypercoagulable state. Acute mesenteric ischemia is life-threatening because of complications of bowel necrosis including sepsis, peritonitis, and perforation. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 31 of 50 'I 31 . A 46-year-old woman with immune thrombocytopenic purpura has been treated with prednisone (100 mg daily) and immune globulin for 6 weeks without relief . Her platelet count is 20,000/mm 3 Bleeding time is prolonged , clot retraction is poor, and platelet life span is shortened . A bone marrow biopsy specimen shows a near-normal level of megakaryocytes . Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Aspirin therapy B) Increase prednisone to 200 mg daily C) Doxorubicin therapy D) Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor therapy E) S!Jlenectomy Correct Answer: E. Refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) following treatment with corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is treated with splenectomy. ITP is diagnosed in the setting of a low platelet count with normal bone marrow and an absence of other explanatory causes for thrombocytopenia. It classically presents with petechiae and purpura, and prolonged bleeding time on laboratory analysis. Severe ITP may lead to uncontrolled hemorrhage. Acute ITP often follows an infection and generally is self-limited. Chronic ITP is first treated with corticosteroids which may be required long-term, IVIG, or immunomodulators. Refractory ITP that is non responsive to such therapies is treated with splenectomy, which results in remission of thrombocytopenia in the majority of cases because of the spleen's primary role in the underlying pathophysiology. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Aspirin therapy (Choice A) would worsen this patient's bleeding time by irreversibly inhibiting platelet activation, leading to a further increased risk for abnormal bleeding. Increase prednisone to 200 mg daily (Choice B) would be futile, as the patient is already on a maximal dose of prednisone; any additional dose would only likely worsen adverse effects (e.g., Cushing syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, psychosis) without additional therapeutic benefit. Doxorubicin therapy (Choice C) is not a commonly employed therapy for ITP, as it suppresses bone marrow production, which may further lower the patient's platelet count. There have been case reports of its use, but it is not widely accepted. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) therapy (Choice D) is appropriate therapy for patients with leukopenia but does not have a recognized role in treating refractory thrombocytopenia; in fact, levels of GM-CSF have been shown to be increased in patients with ITP. By comparison, romiplostim and eltrombopag are stimulators of thrombopoiesis that have an adjunct role in the treatment of ITP. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 32 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Patient autonomy is one of four common medical ethical principles, along with beneficence, non maleficence, and justice. Autonomy posits that patients have the right to make their decisions if they have the capacity to do so, and that they have been provided with appropriate information for use in making such a decision. A consenting adult, with decision-making capacity, has the right to refuse some or all aspects of medical care, even if such a decision may result in short- or long-term morbidity or mortality. In this case, Jehovah's witnesses often refuse blood products. Provided that this patient has capacity and that an appropriate consent form has been provided by the treating physician explaining the benefits, risks, and alternatives of receiving or not receiving blood products, the patient may elect to refuse. Prolonged cardiac arrest because of ventricular fibrillation results in impaired perfusion of end-organs, with common short- and long-term sequelae including hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and renal or intestinal ischemia and infarction. This patient presents following cardiac arrest with abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis, with signs of peritonitis. Despite anemia, an emergent exploratory laparotomy to evaluate the bowel is indicated, along with intravenous fluids, antipyretics, and antibiotics.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "resuscitate order may eventually be appropriate; however, at this time, the patient does not have capacity to decide secondary to intubation and sedation impairing mental status. A surrogate decision maker would have to speak on the patient's behalf. Until this occurs, the patient's wishes should be respected as they are known. Administration of erythropoietin, intravenously (Choice B) and administration of iron, intramuscularly (Choice C) may be appropriate for this patient; however, the time to see an effect from administration of erythropoietin or iron (both via hematopoiesis) is days to weeks, offering no immediate benefit in the emergent setting. Transfusion of packed red blood cells (Choice D) violates the patient's expressly stated preference for her healthcare and should not be performed, as this would breach the patient's autonomy. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 33 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Postoperative myocardial infarction is a complication that can occur following physiologically stressful surgical procedures, especially those with high blood loss in patients already predisposed to myocardial infarction (e.g., older, male smokers with history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease). Myocardial infarction can present nonspecifically but classically occurs with shortness of breath, chest pain, light-headedness, nausea, vomiting, or altered mental status, and may be complicated by cardiogenic shock, seen as tachycardia, hypotension, and impaired end-organ perfusion (cool extremities, low urine output). In postoperative cases, especially with intubated patients, it may be difficult to assess the presence of myocardial infarction. Evaluation using ECG, serial troponin assays, and echocardiogram should be considered in such cases. Right-heart catheterization can be used to determine cardiac output and index, along with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which can distinguish right heart failure from left heart failure. An increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure indicates that filling pressures in the left heart are abnormal, which is consistent with myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock.",

It is characterized by the presence of non-caseating granulomas on histology. On diagnostic imaging, patients often present with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, with or without bilateral upper lobe predominant interstitial infiltrates depending on the stage of the patient's disease. The clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic, to mild shortness of breath and cough, to diffuse granulomatous infiltration of multiple organ systems resulting in dysfunction. The diagnosis is presumed based on clinical history and imaging features, although tissue sampling, most commonly from involved lymph nodes, is required to definitively diagnose a patient. Treatment typically requires corticosteroids. Untreated chronic disease can progress to pulmonary fibrosis and restrictive lung physiology.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Gastritis classically presents with left upper quadrant and epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. If erosive gastritis or an ulcer is present, emesis may be blood-streaked, frankly bloody, or coffee-ground in character. If bleeding has been present for several hours, stool may be melanotic. Gastritis commonly occurs from alcohol abuse, excess use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and smoking. Other causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding include esophagitis, esophageal varices, peptic ulcer disease, and arteriovenous malformations. Regardless of the cause of bleeding, any patient presenting with tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, and signs of hemorrhagic shock should receive immediate intravenous volume resuscitation, typically with isotonic crystalloids such as normal saline.",

        "A": "Adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents references myelosuppression, dermatitis, gastrointestinal upset, hair loss, cardiomyopathy, and neuropathy. Some agents may induce thrombophlebitis when instilled over a small vein. Vinca alkaloids are known to cause peripheral neuropathy, which may explain the patient's pain; however, unilateral extremity edema would be less easily explained by known adverse effects of chemotherapeutics. Arterial embolism (Choice B) presents with acute pain, pallor, poikilothermia, weakness, and in extreme cases, pulselessness of the affected extremity. It often arises in a patient with a known risk factor for arterial thromboembolic disease such as atrial fibrillation. It is distinguishable from a DVT on the basis of pulse and blood pressure analysis within the affected extremity and localizing the occlusion within an artery on imaging.",
        "E": "Colonoscopy is used to visualize and treat lesions within the large bowel. Colonoscopy without co-administration of an enema could diagnose but not reduce an intussusception. r O , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 41 of 50 'I 41 . A 3-week-old female newborn is brought to the physician because of an 18-day history of increasingly yellow skin and eyes. She was born at term to a 24-year-old woman , gravida 2, para 2, following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery ; her weight at birth was 3175 g (7 lb). She is exclusively breast-fed . Today, she weighs 3345 g (7 lb 6 oz). Physical examination shows scleral icterus and generalized jaundice . The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities . Her serum total bilirubin concentration is 15 mg/dl with a direct component of 13 mg/dl . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis ? A) ABO incompatibility B) Biliary atresia C) Breast milk jaundice D) Gilbert syndrome E) Hereditary spherocytosis F) Physiologic jaundice Correct Answer: B. In contrast to benign causes of neonatal jaundice, biliary atresia presents with progressively worsening jaundice (conjugated hyperbilirubinemia), pale stools, dark urine, poor weight gain, and, in untreated cases, cirrhosis, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension. Classically, benign causes of neonatal jaundice will improve by the second to third week of life, whereas biliary atresia will persist and often worsen within the first eight weeks of life. There are genetic causes of biliary atresia related to deficient glutathione transferase enzymes, and acquired causes (e.g., infection, exposure to aflatoxin), though often the cause is idiopathic. Diagnosis consists of history and physical examination, liver function testing, HIDA scan, or cholangiography, with definitive diagnosis occurring during exploratory surgery with visualization of atretic bile ducts. Treatment is through hepatoportoenterostomy (Kasai procedure), which restores biliary flow, reduces jaundice, and helps salvage the native liver function. Liver transplant may be required if the procedure is unsuccessful. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, E, and F. ABO incompatibility (Choice A) and hereditary spherocytosis (Choice E) result in indirect hyperbilirubinemia because of the release of heme into the bloodstream during red blood cell lysis. Breast milk jaundice (Choice C) occurs in breast-fed infants and is generally benign. It is typically a self-limited cause of neonatal jaundice. Infants will generally appear healthy and gain weight appropriately; occasionally in rare or severe cases, treatment may be required to prevent complications. Gilbert syndrome (Choice D) is a hereditary cause of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia resulting from diminished activity of uridine glucuronosyltransferase. Patients generally present with mild jaundice during periods of physiologic stress. In most cases, the condition is harmless. Physiologic jaundice (Choice F) is an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurring in neonates. It is characterized by jaundice appearing around the first week of life, with slowly increasing bilirubin concentrations that decline to adult levels by the end of the third week of life. Levels generally do not exceed 12 to 18 mg/dl. Mild cases are usually self-limiting without complication. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 42 of 50 'I 42 . A 22-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 1 hour after being involved in a motor vehicle collision . On arrival , his pulse is 120/min , and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. He has multiple facial lacerations . Which of the following imaging studies is best used to screen for cervical trauma? A) CTscan B) Lateral x-ray C) MRI D) Myelography E) Tomography Correct Answer: B. In patients without features concerning for cervical spine injury (absence of midline pain, neurologic deficits, distracting injury, intoxication, altered level of consciousness, or a high energy mechanism of injury) and in whom the pretest probability of a cervical spine injury is low (young, healthy, low energy mechanism of injury, no history of fragility fractures, and unremarkable examination), a lateral cervical spine x-ray can serve as a sufficiently sensitive screening test. Several decision rules have been developed to support the need for imaging in evaluating the cervical spine, including the NEXUS and Canadian C-spine rules. These rules are sensitive, not specific, meaning that they are used to rule out injury in a patient with low pretest probability. In any patient with moderate to high clinical suspicion of injury, a CT scan or MRI of the cervical spine should be obtained for more definitive evaluation. In pediatric trauma, x-ray imaging remains the modality of choice because of lower radiation exposure, generally low pretest probability, and reasonable sensitivity and specificity. lncorrectAnswer:A, C, D, and E. CT scan (Choice A) and MRI (Choice C) are appropriate noninvasive studies for investigation of cervical spine injuries when the clinician is unable to reasonably exclude them using lower radiation, lower cost, and less time-intensive techniques. If a patient exhibits moderate to high pretest probability of a cervical spine injury, or exhibits symptoms such as midline pain, neurologic deficits, distracting injury, intoxication, or an altered level of consciousness, a CT scan or MRI of the cervical spine should be obtained.",
        "D": "Myelography involves examination of the spinal cord using an x-ray or CT scan following injection of an intrathecal contrast medium. It has largely been replaced by MRI because of improved image accuracy, nonionizing radiation, and noninvasive technique.",
        "C": "Cellulitis presents with cutaneous pain, erythema, and induration spreading outward from a source of infection, often an initial abrasion or injection.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Penetrating trauma to the thigh with absent pulses distal to the wound suggests arterial injury and warrants immediate surgical exploration and repair to prevent ischemic injury to the limb or exsanguination. Signs of arterial injury include visualized pulsatile bleeding, rapidly expanding hematoma, asymmetric or absent pulses in the extremity, auscultated bruits, and diminished ankle-brachia! indices. Tachycardia, narrow pulse pressure, or hypotension may indicate the development of hemorrhagic shock. The diagnosis of an arterial injury is clinical when the physical examination demonstrates arterial bleeding and absent pulses. In cases of uncertainty, when the patient is hemodynamically stable, a CT angiography can be obtained for the visualization of vessel discontinuity or injury and for the assessment of active bleeding.",

        "A": "Cardiomyopathy presents with signs and symptoms of heart failure with either preserved or reduced ejection fraction. These include dyspnea on exertion, reduced exercise tolerance, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, shortness of breath, fatigue, weight gain, and peripheral edema. Physical examination often discloses jugular venous distention, peripheral edema, and an S or S gallop. 3 4",
        "B": "Hemothorax results from blood accumulating within the pleural space, often from trauma to the pulmonary, bronchial, or intercostal vessels in the setting of rib fractures or penetrating trauma. It presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, dullness to percussion, and diminished breath sounds on the affected side. If massive, hemodynamic instability may occur. Open pneumothorax (Choice C) presents following a thoracic wound or fistula in continuity with the pleural space. On examination, a bubbling chest wound may be noted with ipsilateral hyperresonance to percussion and diminished breath sounds. If the pneumothorax is under tension (Choice E), jugular venous distention, tracheal deviation, tachycardia, and hypotension may be present. Traumatic diaphragmatic hernia (Choice F) leads to the presence of abdominal contents within the thorax and presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and bowel sounds within the lung fields. It most commonly occurs in the left hemithorax and may be visualized as intestinal loops on x-rays. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 46 of 50 46 . A previously healthy 62-year-old man comes to the physician 2 days after an episode of blindness in the right eye that lasted 5 to 10 minutes . He has no history of similar episodes or other neurologic symptoms . He has type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent. His pulse is 75/min , respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. Examination shows intact motor and sensory function . The visual fields are full to confrontation . Results of funduscopic examination are shown . Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings? A) Cardiomyopathy B) Carotid stenosis C) Cataract D) Diabetic retinopathy E) Glaucoma Correct Answer: B. Amaurosis fugax describes sudden, painless monocular vision loss that begins abruptly and often resolves quickly, caused by a thromboembolic event involving the retinal artery. When no residual deficit remains, amaurosis fugax is characterized as a transient ischemic attack of the retina. It is classically associated with carotid stenosis secondary to atherosclerosis as a source of embolus, often indicating the need for medical or surgical optimization of carotid vascular disease to prevent a future catastrophic stroke or retinal artery occlusion. Following an episode of amaurosis fugax, funduscopic examination may be normal. It may show diminished arterial blood flow in the event of ongoing central retinal artery occlusion (characterized by a pale retina with cherry red macula), or branch retinal artery cholesterol emboli (Hollenhorst plaques) as seen in this patient. The patient should receive an ultrasonography or CT angiography of the carotid to assess the extent of disease, caliber, and flow; carotid endarterectomy may be indicated in cases of moderate to severe stenosis to reduce the risk for future stroke. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E.",
        "C": "Arteriography is an interventional procedure that involves injecting contrast material into an artery to permit visualization under fluoroscopy. This technique risks toxicity to the kidney and is invasive; it has largely been replaced by CT scan and MR angiography for initial vascular evaluation. Peritoneal lavage (Choice D) involves aspiration of peritoneal contents, infusing sterile saline into the peritoneal cavity, and analyzing the effluent. If blood, food particles, bile, bilirubin, amylase, or alkaline phosphatase are found, exploratory laparotomy is indicated as the presence of these findings suggests hollow or solid viscus injury. Peritoneal lavage has no role in evaluating retroperitoneal structures such as the kidney. Exploratory operation (Choice E) may be required depending on the degree of renal injury but should not be performed prior to assessing the extent of injury through diagnostic imaging as the patient is otherwise stable. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 48 of 50 'I",
        "E": "Glaucoma occurs because of acute or chronic increases in pressure within the anterior chamber of the eye and may present as acute, painful, or chronic, painless vision loss.

There is tenderness over the left flank but no external marks . Urinalysis shows gross blood . Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Renal blood flow scan B) CT scan of the abdomen and kidneys C) Arteriography D) Peritoneal lavage E) Exploratory operation Correct Answer: B. CT scan of the abdomen and kidneys is the most appropriate next step when renal injury is suspected following blunt trauma. Blunt renal injury can result from moderate- to high-energy mechanisms, such as falls or motor vehicle accidents. The spectrum of potential injury includes renal contusion, laceration, hematoma, pelvic or calyceal rupture, and partial or complete devascularization. Evaluation for renal injury in the emergent setting includes imaging, typically CT scan with contrast of the abdomen and pelvis, and urinalysis to assess for the presence of gross or microscopic hematuria. Small, uncomplicated injuries may be managed conservatively with serial examinations and observation; large, complicated, or devitalizing injuries may require surgical intervention. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E. Renal blood flow scan (Choice A), also known as renal scintigraphy, involves the use of an injected radiotracer to evaluate and quantify the flow of blood to the kidney. It would not provide fine anatomic detail of traumatic injuries and is a time-consuming test that is not indicated in the emergent post-traumatic setting."

Spasms are typically not associated with weight loss or vomiting of undigested food. Globus hystericus (Choice C) describes the sensation of a mass in the oropharynx typically associated with emotional distress or signs of concomitant gastroesophageal reflux. Chronic symptoms of weight loss would not be expected. Hiatal hernia (Choice D) is often asymptomatic but can present with epigastric or inferior chest pain, acid reflux, or nausea; dysphagia is generally less likely to be present, unless the patient demonstrates a severe paraesophageal hiatal hernia. Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) (Choice E) can present with esophageal dysmotility but would also often be accompanied by taut, hardened skin; Raynaud phenomenon; end-stage kidney disease; telangiectasias; cardiac fibrosis; and lower gastrointestinal tract fibrosis. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 50 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Burns are classified by the degree of depth, severity, and extent of body surface area involved. Superficial burns (first-degree) do not involve layers deep to the epidermis and are characterized by erythema and pain, without blistering or loss of sensation. Partial thickness (second-degree) burns involve the epidermis and a portion of the dermis; they classically present with blistering, sloughing, severe pain, and erythema. Full thickness (third-degree) burns involve the epidermis and the full dermis, and are often accompanied by an insensate, charred, or leathery appearance. When calculating burned body surface area, only partial thickness and full thickness burns are counted. Superficial burns are not considered significant regarding fluid balance and resuscitation or the need for surgical intervention, as the stratum basalis and stem cells within hair follicles are preserved. In a superficial burn, the epidermis can regenerate from these unaffected sources of stem cells, whereas grafting may be required for deeper burns harming the cells responsible for tissue repair and regeneration. Uncomplicated, superficial burns require only observation and supportive therapy (e.g., aloe ointment, pain control).",

Nipple discharge is concerning for underlying malignant pathology if presenting as spontaneous bloody, serosanguinous, or clear unilateral discharge or if there is discharge in the setting of a palpable breast mass. lntraductal papillomas are benign tumors originating from the walls of milk ducts that typically grow and can result in local duct obstruction. Papillomas can be solitary or multiple, and while typically benign, can contain areas of atypia or carcinoma. Mammography is not typically sensitive for intraductal papilloma, particularly when small. Galactography can be performed, involving cannulation and injection of contrast into a duct, which demonstrates a filling defect. Breast ultrasound and MRI can also be utilized to evaluate the extent and characteristics of the papillomas.

Warts and verrucous carcinoma can appear on the penis, vagina, vulva, and/or anal canal, and patients with HIV are prone to severe condyloma lesions in these regions. To definitively diagnose the cause of this large mass, a biopsy should first take place, especially given the risk for malignancy. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, E, and F. Topical podophyllin therapy {Choice A) is an antimitotic, cytotoxic medication that can be used for the treatment of genital warts once a clear diagnosis is made. Administration of the human papillomavirus vaccine {Choice B) is recommended for both male and female patients between ages 9 and 26 years. For both genders, it provides protection against genital warts, with the additional benefit of reduced cervical cancer risk in women. This should not be the first step in management in a patient presenting with a potential giant condyloma acuminatum or verrucous carcinoma from an HPV infection. Chemotherapy {Choice D) and radiation therapy {Choice E) are not appropriate as the next step in management requires biopsy of this undifferentiated mass, as the cause is still unknown. Local excision of the mass {Choice F) may be considered for the definitive removal of this perinea! mass but should be considered once the diagnosis is confirmed. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 6 of 50 X",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "A majority of penile cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. While penile cancer is rare, a lack of circumcision and infection with human papillomavirus are risk factors. Precursor lesions to squamous cell carcinoma of the penis are Bowen disease, which presents as leukoplakia of the penile shaft, or erythroplasia of Queyrat, which presents as erythroplakia of the glans. The most common location of penile cancer is the glans penis. Squamous cell carcinoma can range in presentation from a small area of induration to a large ulcerating, infiltrative lesion. Differential considerations for an ulcerative penile lesion also include primary syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum, and chancroid. As well, condyloma acuminatum, lichen planus, and psoriatic plaques may mimic early stages of penile squamous cell carcinoma.",

In younger males, this is commonly secondary to sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In older males, Escherichia coli is more common. Gonococcal urethritis (Choice C) typically presents with dysuria and mucopurulent penile discharge. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative diplococcus that causes cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, Fitz Hugh-Curtis syndrome, and migratory septic arthritis.",
        "D": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is typically transmitted through saliva and respiratory secretions and can present with a variety of symptoms, including herpes labialis, herpetic whitlow, encephalitis, esophagitis, and keratoconjunctivitis. While commonly a pathogen located in respiratory and oral secretions, HSV-1 does have the potential for sexual contact transmission, along with herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), which can lead to genital herpes. HSV-2 may also present with oral or labial lesions or encephalitis. Inguinal hernias (Choice E) are protrusions of abdominal contents into the inguinal region through a defect in the lower abdominal wall. Incarceration and strangulation are potential complications of inguinal hernias and may require surgical correction. Nongonococcal urethritis (Choice F) is commonly secondary to infection from Chlamydia trachomatis and typically presents with painful urination and watery urethral discharge. Gram stain of urine typically demonstrates a sterile pyuria, characterized by the presence of white blood cells without organisms. Diagnosis is through a urine nucleic acid amplification test. Chlamydia trachomatis is a common sexually transmitted disease that can cause cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, epididymitis, and urethritis. Scrotal abscesses (Choice H) can occur intrascrotal or within the skin of the scrotum.

Anal fissures are tears in the superficial anal mucosa below the dentate line, typically along the posterior midline. Because of their location below the dentate line with resultant somatic nervous system innervation, they result in significant pain during defection and are associated with bright red blood per rectum. A common initiating factor for the development of an anal fissure is the passage of hard stool resulting in trauma to the anal mucosa. While some anal fissures self-resolve, persistent anal fissures can result in anal spasms and increased sphincter tone on examination. Initial management for persistent, symptomatic anal fissures includes administration of stool softeners, Sitz bath, topical analgesics, and topical vasodilators. The goal of this combination therapy is to relieve pain, allow for anal sphincter relaxation, and reduce traumatic passage of stool through the anal canal. Sitz bath allows for anal sphincter relaxation and improved anal mucosa blood flow to promote healing.",

Placement of elastic bands (Choice D) is used for the ligation of internal hemorrhoids. This results in diminished blood flow to the hemorrhoid, which subsequently becomes necrotic and sloughs off. Surgical drainage of the abscess (Choice E) is not appropriate as this patient presents with a posterior midline anal fissure, not a perianal abscess. If an anal fissure is seen in a location other than the posterior midline anus, this raises suspicion for the presence of underlying Crohn disease, which can result in complications such as anal fistulas and perianal abscesses. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 8 of 50 'I"

A CT scan demonstrates a left adrenal mass, possibly an adrenal adenoma, with bilateral hypersecretion of aldosterone on adrenal vein sampling, which may indicate bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, resulting in excess secretion of aldosterone. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that serves as an aldosterone receptor antagonist. This causes diminished effects of aldosterone on the renal collecting tubules, which results in decreased sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Candesartan therapy is an angiotensin 11 receptor blocker used primarily in the management of hypertension, heart failure, and end-stage kidney disease. It would not provide any clinical benefit in a patient with hyperaldosteronism, as renin and angiotensin II levels are appropriately suppressed because of excess aldosterone level. Furosemide therapy (Choice B) is indicated for the management of hypervolemic states such as heart failure and cirrhosis. A known adverse effect is hypokalemia. Bilateral adrenalectomy (Choice D) is a definitive treatment for refractory Cushing disease and is less commonly used in the setting of hyperaldosteronism. First-line management requires use of an aldosterone antagonist, as a bilateral adrenalectomy would require close monitoring and supplementation of adrenal hormones. Unilateral adrenalectomy (Choice E) is indicated for the resection of a hyperfunctioning adrenal adenoma. In this case, adrenal vein sampling indicates bilateral hypersecretion of aldosterone, suggestive of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, rather than a solitary hyperfunctioning adrenal adenoma. r \" , r-- r , 11 .

He has Gilbert syndrome , osteoarthritis , and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Current medications include fluoxetine and daily ibuprofen . He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years and drinks three alcoholic beverages daily. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min , and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice . There are excoriations over the back. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities . Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 13 g/dL Hematocrit 39% Leukocyte count 8000/mm 3 Serum Bilirubin , total 12.2 mg/dL Direct 10 mg/dL Alkaline phosphatase 490 U/L Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography shows narrowing of the biliary ducts . Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition? A) Alcohol consumption B) Cigarette smoking C) Gilbert syndrome D) Ibuprofen therapy E) Ulcerative colitis Correct Answer: E. Ulcerative colitis is associated with the development of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PSC is a biliary tract disease that affects both the intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts. It causes progressive inflammation and concentric fibrosis of the bile ducts, resulting in alternating regions of strictures and dilations ('beading'). These biliary strictures result in cholestasis and inadequate biliary excretion. PSC most commonly occurs in younger and middle-age men. It typically presents with progressive jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, pruritus, light-colored stools, and dark urine. Laboratory values may demonstrate a direct hyperbilirubinemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, and a detectable peripheral anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA). Patients with PSC are at increased risk for developing cholangiocarcinoma. Diagnostic evaluation occurs through endoscopic or magnetic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP/MRCP), which demonstrates the strictures and dilations of the intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts; and via liver biopsy. Treatment includes dilation and stenting of strictures to improve biliary excretion, and if severe, liver transplantation may be required. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Alcohol consumption (Choice A) can result in progressive hepatocellular injury and increased risk for cirrhosis, which may present with a mixed direct/indirect hyperbilirubinemia in the setting of cirrhotic clinical sequelae such as hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathy. Biliary strictures and dilations would be less likely in isolation. Cigarette smoking (Choice B) is not a risk factor for primary sclerosing cholangitis. It is actually associated with a reduced severity of ulcerative colitis. Gilbert syndrome (Choice C) results in a mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia secondary to mildly decreased conjugation and impaired bilirubin uptake following a stress event. Ibuprofen therapy (Choice D), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is not associated with an increased risk for biliary strictures. The most common gastrointestinal adverse effect is the development of peptic ulcer disease and gastritis because of impaired prostaglandin-driven mucosal protective mechanisms. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 12 of 50 'I"

Enteral feeding refers to the administration of nutrition to a patient through the gastrointestinal tract. The patient recently underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy and has a jejunostomy tube in place distal to the anastomosis. The patient is unable to receive nutrition by mouth ('per os') as the surgical anastomosis requires time to heal prior to receiving an oral food bolus. The jejunostomy tube is located distal to the surgical anastomosis and presents a route for enteral nutrition that would allow for enteral feeds and concomitant appropriate healing of the anastomosis. Enteral feeding is the preferred method for providing nutrition to patients, if possible, as it is the closest to normal, physiologic nutrition. It presents few complications and is low-cost.",

        "B": "dextrose in water can provide patients with supplementation to maintain glucose levels and is commonly used in the acute setting for management of hypoglycemia. It is not a suitable substitute for long-term feeding as it only provides dextrose, with no additional protein, lipid, vitamin, or mineral content. Parenteral administration of lipid emulsion (Choice C) and total parenteral nutrition (Choice D) are forms of intravenous nutrition. These routes are used when the patient is unable to receive adequate caloric and nutrient intake through an enteral route (e.g., short gut syndrome). Parenteral nutrition typically has a specific composition of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, electrolytes, and vitamins that are specifically tailored for the patient's nutrition requirements. No nutrients should be given at this time (Choice E) is not the appropriate next step, as surgical healing requires appropriate nutritional provision. In absence of adequate nutrition, the patient's overall clinical condition would deteriorate because of inadequate energy substrate and anabolic supply, resulting in delayed post-surgical healing, muscle and fat wasting, and potential starvation ketosis. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 13 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Clostridium difficile infection is an opportunistic and often hospital-acquired infection that commonly occurs after the use of antibiotics, especially ampicillin and clindamycin, because of the loss of native colonic microbiota. This derangement in native microbiota presents an opportunity for competition-free proliferation of C. difficile, which produces toxins that result in dysfunction of the brush border and a subsequent secretory diarrhea. C. difficile infections are associated with the presence of pseudomembranes that appear as patchy regions of white mucosa on colonoscopy. The severity of C. difficile colitis can vary, ranging from watery diarrhea without constitutional symptoms in mild cases to toxic megacolon, colonic ischemia, and severe sepsis in fulminant cases. Treatment includes oral or rectal vancomycin, intravenous metronidazole, fidaxomicin, or colectomy depending on the severity of the patient's presentation.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Blind loop syndrome can occur in cases of impaired bowel motility such as structural pouch creation during Billroth or Roux-En-Y bypass. Resultant stagnation of intestinal food bolus passage increases the risk for bacterial overgrowth. The uncontrolled growth of bacteria occurs because of the loss of peristaltic propulsion and leads to malabsorption, diarrhea, bloating, and chronic abdominal pain. Dumping syndrome (Choice C) is a potential complication of gastric bypass resulting from the rapid emptying of contents from the stomach into the small bowel. This results in an abnormal osmotic gradient within the small bowel, which can present 15 to 30 minutes after eating a meal with severe nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. lschemic colitis (Choice D) refers to inadequate blood supply to the colon, which can lead to bowel wall necrosis, loss of immune barriers, and bowel perforation. This most commonly occurs in the setting of atherosclerosis, an embolic event in the setting of atrial fibrillation, or systemic hypotension. Loss of vagal innervation to the ileum (Choice E) would result in diminished peristalsis along the region of denervation. This may occur as a post-surgical complication but would not be expected to result in severe watery diarrhea. Mesenteric vein thrombosis (Choice F) can occur in the setting of hypercoagulability, postsurgical state, and inflammatory diseases such as pancreatitis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. This can result in impaired venous drainage of the bowel, and potential venous bowel ischemia. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 14 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The differential diagnosis for a liver mass with a central scar primarily includes focal nodular hyperplasia, fibrolamellar carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma, with less likely alternatives of hemangioma and hepatocellular carcinoma. The most likely etiology of this mass is focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), a regenerative lesion of the liver, and the second most common benign lesion of the liver following hepatic hemangioma. It is typically asymptomatic and found incidentally in patients with right upper quadrant pain. CT scan and MRI typically demonstrate a classic central scar with radiating fibrous septa ('spoke wheel'). FNH lesions exhibit no malignant potential and do not require further testing for diagnostic workup or therapeutic intervention.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "fetoprotein concentration is indicated for surveillance of patients with an increased risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (e.g., chronic hepatitis B infection). Hepatitis B virus serology (Choice B) is used in the evaluation of patients with exposure to Hepatitis B to determine if they demonstrate an acute or chronic hepatitis B infection pattern, or if they exhibit appropriate immunization serology. Radionuclide liver scan (Choice C) can be used for the evaluation of a liver mass in differentiating FNH from other primary hepatic masses. In general, hepatic masses apart from FNH will be 'cold' on a radionuclide liver scan with a region of relative photopenia (decreased tracer uptake) corresponding to the site of the mass. Because FNH contains Kupffer reticuloendothelial cells, it takes up radiotracer similar to the background liver. This patient's diagnosis of FNH can be concluded from the ultrasonography and CT scan, making a nuclear liver scan unnecessary. MRI of the liver (Choice D) can be used to further characterize a hepatic mass when the diagnosis is uncertain. MRI offers better contrast resolution than both ultrasonography and CT scan, which allows for more definitive diagnostic evaluation in certain settings. This patient's diagnosis of FNH can be concluded from the ultrasonography and CT scan, making MRI unnecessary. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the mass (Choice E) is sometimes indicated for the pathologic evaluation of focal hepatic masses. This patient's ultrasonography and CT scan accurately determine the presence of an FNH, which does not require a biopsy for further workup. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 15 of 50 'I"

Ruptures present with severe lower abdominal and pelvic pain and tenderness with associated anuria; blood may be noted at the urethral meatus on examination. CT scan or fluoroscopic cystography is the diagnostic examination of choice, with contrast leaking into the retro/extraperitoneal space in an extraperitoneal rupture and into the peritoneal cavity in an intraperitoneal rupture.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Direct pressure to the bleeding laceration is the most appropriate step in immediate management of exsanguinating injuries. Lacerations to the scalp can result in hemodynamically significant blood loss because of its rich vascularity. In this specific case, airway and breathing are managed, which indicates that the immediate attention should be paid to circulation and hemodynamic stability. Tachycardia is a sign of hypovolemia, which must be attributed to hemorrhagic shock at this stage of workup. Given the patient's otherwise unremarkable physical examination outside of his left humeral fracture, direct pressure should be applied to the scalp wound, and intravascular volume loss should be replaced with 0.9% saline, followed by an emergent blood transfusion if hemodynamic instability results.",

        "B": "CT scan of the abdomen is not the best next step for this patient as he presents with a benign abdomen on physical examination, borderline hemodynamic instability, and injuries primarily to the head with visible blood loss. CT scan of the abdomen may be utilized in the evaluation of blunt abdominal injury in a stable patient, whereas focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) is used for hemodynamically unstable patients with a suspected abdominal source of bleeding. Intravenous administration of a vasopressor (Choice C) is indicated for the treatment of shock unresponsive to intravenous fluids or blood in the setting of hemorrhage. Transfusion of type-specific packed red blood cells (Choice D) is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic severe anemia or active bleeding . In the acute traumatic setting, non-type-specific packed red blood cells are used because of the rapid requirement for transfusion; however, transfusion should follow attempts at hemostasis through compression if unstable vital signs persist. Closed reduction of the fracture (Choice E) may be required once the left humerus is examined with x-rays to assess the fracture pattern. Humerus fractures are seldom a source of internal exsanguination, in contrast to femur and pelvic fractures . r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 19 of 50 'I"

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms? A) Decreased pulmonary artery flow B) Decreased pulmonary vascular resistance C) Decreased systemic vascular resistance D) Increased pulmonary artery blood flow E) Increased pulmonary vascular resistance F) Increased systemic vascular resistance Correct Answer: E. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance occurs in the setting of a persistent, chronic left-to-right shunt. The patient has a history of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair as a child, although she exhibits a holosystolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border, which suggests the continued presence of a VSD. VSD results in a left-to-right shunt, which increases pulmonary blood flow. This leads to remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature and resultant smooth muscle hypertrophy. In turn, concentric narrowing of the pulmonary arterioles occurs, which results in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension. If severe and progressive enough, this can cause increased right ventricular pressures and associated myocardial hypertrophy, which subsequently results in reversal of the shunt, presenting with shortness of breath and cyanosis. The patient's elevated pulmonary artery and right-heart pressures increase her risk for right-sided heart failure explaining her lower extremity edema, and for atrial fibrillation explaining her irregularly irregular tachyarrhythmia. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, and F. Decreased pulmonary artery flow (Choice A) occurs in the setting of some right-to-left shunts, for example, Tetralogy of Fallo! that presents with pulmonary infundibular stenosis. Decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (Choice B) occurs in the setting of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Decreased systemic vascular resistance (Choice C) would result in decreased systemic mean arterial pressure and may be seen in cases of distributive shock such as anaphylaxis, sepsis, and neurogenic shock. Increased pulmonary artery blood flow (Choice D) occurs in the setting of a persistent left-to-right shunt. This patient likely demonstrated chronic increased pulmonary artery blood flow from a persistent shunt, which led to pulmonary vascular remodeling. Her current presentation is secondary to the resultant increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Increased systemic vascular resistance (Choice F) would result in increased systemic mean arterial pressure and is a common cause of chronic hypertension. This patient's presentation is secondary to increased pulmonary vascular resistance from chronic remodeling, not systemic vascular resistance. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 22 of 50 'I"

Perforation can result from traumatic injury, erosion of an ulcer or gastritis through the muscularis and adventitia, malignant invasion, or necrosis or infarction of a segment of bowel, and presents with symptoms of peritonitis. Peritonitis classically presents as acute, severe abdominal pain which may rapidly progress to sepsis and shock. Patients typically demonstrate unstable vital signs such as fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. Examination discloses a guarded and rigid abdomen, which is often \"board-like\". Due to translocation of intraluminal contents into the peritoneal space, fulminant sepsis can ensue. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (e.g. aspirin and ibuprofen) is a key risk factor for the development of peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, and should raise suspicion for a perforated viscus in the setting of an acutely peritonitic patient. These medications inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which plays a critical role in the maintenance of the gastric mucosal barrier by counterbalancing the erosive effects of stomach acid through the synthesis of bicarbonate and mucus. Pneumoperitoneum on the chest x-ray shows the presence of a perforated hollow viscus. Peritonitis requires emergent exploratory laparotomy to locate and control the source and washout peritoneal contents that may promote ongoing infection.",

These patients are more likely to aspirate gastric contents into the lung, which results in bacterial seeding with gastrointestinal or oral flora and can lead to pneumonia. Frequently, aspiration occurs in a dependent segment of the lung such as bilateral lower lobes when erect or the lingula, right middle lobe, and superior segments of the lower lobes while lying down.",

        "B": "Adverse effects of hydromorphone include gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, vomiting, and constipation; significant respiratory depression; altered mental status; and miosis in the setting of overdose. This can result in aspiration of contents because of a depressed mental status and failure of airway protection. However, this patient does not show signs of significant impairment from hydromorphone, making impaired airway protective reflexes in the setting of known Parkinson disease more likely. Impaired esophageal motility (Choice D) is a potential cause of aspiration because of impaired transit of food bolus along the length of the esophagus, which can result in regurgitation and increased risk for aspiration. This patient demonstrates vomiting in the postoperative period with a history of Parkinson disease, which likely explains her aspiration event, not esophageal dysmotility. Increased salivation (Choice E) is a potential adverse effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used in myasthenia gravis or Alzheimer disease.

        "A": "Decreased serum testosterone concentration is a cause of infertility seen in diseases such as Klinefelter syndrome and Kallmann syndrome. These are typically associated with hypogonadism and other clinical findings such as eunuchoid body shape and gynecomastia in Klinefelter syndrome, and anosmia in Kallmann syndrome. Idiopathic infertility (Choice B) is not the correct answer as the patient demonstrates a left-sided varicocele, which is a known cause of infertility related to increased scrotal and testicular temperature. Increased serum corticosteroid concentration (Choice D) is characteristic of Cushing syndrome, which commonly presents with features of hypertension, moon facies, abdominal striae, osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, and amenorrhea. It can result in infertility in women, which is related to amenorrhea. While it can result in impotence and decreased libido in men, it is not directly associated with male infertility. Isolated luteinizing hormone deficiency (Choice E) is an uncommon cause of infertility in men. Insufficient production of luteinizing hormone would result in inadequate stimulation of Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone. This could result in infertility, although this patient has a varicocele on physical examination, which is a more common cause of infertility. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 25 of 50 The response options for the next 2 items are the same .

Pulmonary artery catheterization indicates a decreased cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, with an increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Hypovolemic shock occurs secondary to significant reductions in a patient's intravascular volume most commonly related to hemorrhage, dehydration, or gastrointestinal losses, which results in decreased stroke volume and cardiac output. This, in turn, results in arteriolar vasoconstriction to increase SVR in an attempt to maintain mean arterial pressure. If progressive and severe enough, the body is unable to further compensate, which leads to the development of hypotension and inadequate organ perfusion {shock).",

Antithrombin Ill deficiency is another cause of hypercoagulability that can be hereditary or acquired as a result of nephrotic syndrome. It results in diminished effectiveness of heparin. Measurement of transcutaneous oxygen tension in the feet (Choice B) would allow for further investigation of asymmetric decreased perfusion to the right foot, although this would delay therapeutic intervention for the patient's acute arterial occlusion of the right lower extremity, which can be diagnosed based on symptoms and findings on CT arteriography. Impedance plethysmography (Choice D) is a noninvasive test that allows for measurement of changes in electrical resistance in regions of the body, which indirectly reflects blood volume alterations.

Pulmonary angiography (Choice C) constitutes invasive catheter angiographic evaluation of the pulmonary arteries. This is no longer necessary for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism given advances in ventilation perfusion scans and CT pulmonary angiography, but may still be performed during pulmonary embolectomy (Choice E). Embolectomy is sometimes required in the setting of a massive pulmonary embolism resulting in obstructive shock and systemic hypotension, or in setting of severe right heart strain, which may require more rapid removal of the embolus.

A) Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma B) Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease) C) Graves disease D) Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland E) Subacute thyroiditis Correct Answer: B. Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease) is the most common form of thyroiditis and is characterized by the presence of antithyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin antibodies. The early stages of Hashimoto thyroiditis can present with neck swelling and a diffusely enlarged, nontender thyroid gland. The patient's clinical symptoms and thyroid laboratory studies may demonstrate no significant abnormalities or can show evidence of hyperthyroidism from destruction of thyroid follicular cells and the unregulated release of thyroid hormone. During the chronic stages of Hashimoto thyroiditis, the patient typically develops primary hypothyroidism from the underlying inflammatory destruction of normal thyroid parenchyma and resultant insufficient production of thyroid hormone. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (Choice A) is a type of thyroid cancer that typically occurs in older patients. It exhibits a very poor prognosis and has the ability to invade local structures such as the esophagus and trachea, producing symptoms such as dysphagia and hoarseness. Graves disease (Choice C) is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism and occurs because of the presence of TSH-receptor-stimulating antibodies. This results in a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland on physical examination, along with pretibial myxedema and exophthalmos. Thyroid laboratory studies typically demonstrate findings of a primary hyperthyroidism with increased thyroxine and triiodothyronine, and decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone. Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland (Choice D) is the most common thyroid cancer. It typically presents with a solitary thyroid nodule and is characterized by the presence of nuclear grooves with empty-appearing nuclei and psammoma bodies on histological evaluation. It typically carries a good prognosis. Subacute thyroiditis (Choice E), also known as granulomatous de Quervain thyroiditis, is a self-limited thyroiditis that typically presents with tender thyroid gland enlargement often associated with flu-like symptoms. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 32 of 50 'I"

On physical examination, a pneumothorax presents as unilateral diminished breath sounds with hyperresonance to percussion. Obstruction of venous return results in jugular venous distention, and shifting of mediastinal structures results in contralateral tracheal deviation. The diagnosis of tension pneumothorax should be made clinically. Treatment requires emergent needle decompression of the pneumothorax, followed by tube thoracostomy.",

        "A": "Air embolism can occur in both venous and arterial circulations. Risk factors include thoracic trauma, barotrauma, decompression sickness, cardiothoracic surgery, and surgery of the head and neck. Symptoms vary based on the location of embolism. Typical symptoms of a large venous air embolism include acute shortness of breath, tachypnea, and chest pain. Cardiac tamponade (Choice B) occurs from rapid-onset and/or large volume pericardia! effusions resulting in compression of the cardiac chambers and obstructive shock. Physical examination findings include Beck triad (hypotension, distended jugular veins, and distant heart sounds). ECG may demonstrate electrical alternans and there may be pulsus paradoxus on evaluation of blood pressure. Treatment requires emergent pericardiocentesis.",
        "C": "Claustrophobia is a type of specific phobia associated with crowded or tight spaces. It would not present with unilateral loss of breath sounds following subclavian catheter placement, which is indicative of a pneumothorax. Massive hemothorax (Choice D) can occur following thoracic trauma or as a complication of thoracostomy placement. Physical examination typically demonstrates reduced breath sounds on the side of injury along with dullness to percussion. Hemorrhagic shock can result from substantial blood losses into the hemithorax. Hypovolemia in this setting manifests as a flat jugular vein, rather than jugular venous distention. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 34 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "A lung abscess presents with symptoms of pulmonary infection such as cough, hemoptysis, fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia with a cavitary lesion often containing an air-fluid level present on imaging. It is a potential complication of pneumonia, especially in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mechanical ventilation, or immunosuppression. ARDS is characterized by respiratory failure with bilateral diffuse interstitial and airspace opacities from underlying diffuse alveolar damage and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. ARDS is associated with aspiration, pneumonia, trauma, sepsis, and shock. Mechanical ventilation is often required in the management of ARDS because of hypoxia and hypoventilation. Further, polymicrobial flora on bronchial washings raises concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The most common organisms in the setting of VAP are gram-negative rods (e.g., Klebsiel/a species, Pseudomonas species), anaerobes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Given the virulence of the possible underlying infectious organisms, the development of a new cavitary lesion is likely secondary to the formation of a lung abscess. Treatment requires further administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, prevention of aspiration, and source control with surgical resection or percutaneous drainage.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Aspergillosis can result in many different clinical presentations such as aspergillomas, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic necrotizing aspergillosis, and airway invasive or angioinvasive aspergillosis. Aspergillomas are the most common; they are fungal masses that arise within existing cavitary lesions of the lung, such as those caused by previous infection with tuberculosis, emphysematous blebs or bullae, or from cavitary squamous cell lung carcinoma.",
        "B": "Atelectasis refers to the partial or complete collapse or incomplete expansion of pulmonary parenchyma. There are multiple types of atelectasis, including obstructive, passive, compressive, cicatricial, and adhesive. It is most common in patients who are immobile and/or in the post-surgical state, who are unable to produce adequate tidal volume to expand the lungs. Atelectasis would not present with a cavitary lesion.",
        "D": "Pneumatoceles are air-filled cystic spaces in the pulmonary parenchyma that usually occur following pneumonia (post-infectious pneumatocele), trauma, or secondary to barotrauma in neonates.",
        "E": "Tuberculosis most commonly occurs in homeless persons, people with alcohol use disorder, incarcerated patients, those from endemic areas (e.g., Africa, South America), and those living in close contact with infected individuals. Tuberculosis classically presents with fever, night sweats, weight loss, and hemoptysis. The chest x-ray in reactivation tuberculosis shows cavitary lesions in bilateral lung apices, with possible evidence of a Ghon complex (pulmonary calcified granulomas and hilar adenopathy) from the prior primary tuberculous infection. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 35 of 50"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The patient presents with a palpable thrill, diminished pulses, and a continuous machine-like murmur at the site of prior arteriography in the right groin. The arteriogram demonstrates dense contrast located in the right external iliac and femoral arteries, with contrast inappropriately seen in the adjacent right femoral vein and distal external iliac vein. The patient's clinical presentation and findings on arteriography indicate the formation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), likely a complication of the previous arteriography. This AVF results in abnormal communication between an artery and vein, leading to low resistance, high-volume flow of blood between the artery and vein. An AVF reduces systemic vascular resistance through the creation of a shunt to the high capacitance, low pressure venous system and can lead to the development of high-output cardiac failure. The size of the AVF is most predictive of the risk for developing heart failure, as a larger AVF results in higher flow between the artery and vein, requiring the heart to compensate with greater output to supply the remainder of the systemic circulation.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Degree of edema in the lower extremity would be an indicator of heart failure in a patient with systolic or diastolic heart failure not secondary to an arteriovenous fistula. Lower extremity edema is an indicator of right-sided heart failure, and the degree of edema may indicate the severity of dysfunction. Groin compression causing bradycardia (Choice B) can occur as a vasovagal reaction in response to the compression of the groin. This is not related to the arteriovenous fistula and risk for heart failure. Presence of pallor with elevation and dependent rubor (Choice C) are consistent with peripheral arterial disease. In the setting of chronic claudication, severe peripheral arterial disease may be indicated by the presence of pallor with elevation and dependent rubor. Presence of a pseudoaneurysm (Choice D) may present with a pulsatile mass at the site of prior arteriography or trauma. On arteriography, pseudoaneurysms typically present as contrast-filled outpouchings near the site of prior arteriotomy.

This patient's hemolytic anemia is likely secondary to hemolysis of red blood cells as they cross a malfunctioning mechanical aortic valve.

Transfusion of whole blood (Choice C) is indicated for acute blood loss, hemorrhagic shock, and during exchange transfusion. This patient would benefit from packed red blood cells instead, as her anemia is secondary to macroangiopathic hemolysis of red blood cells from her mechanical aortic valve. Furosemide therapy (Choice D) is mainly utilized for management of volume status, such as in heart failure and cirrhosis.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Debridement and application of a sterile dressing to the open wound is indicated in the management of a human bite wound that extends into the subcutaneous tissue. The management of a human bite wound includes extensive cleaning with an antiseptic solution and debridement of the wound, followed by the application of a sterile dressing to the open wound to maintain cleanliness of the wound site. Because of the increased risk for infection from a human bite, especially from Eikenella corrodens, the wound is often left open as this reduces the risk for the development of infection. As well, any puncture wound that already demonstrates infection or is older than 6 to 12 hours should generally not be closed. Prophylactic antibiotics should be administered, specifically amoxicillin-clavulanate or ampicillin-sulbactam as these provide coverage for E. corrodens.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "D": "thickness skin grafting to the soft tissue defect are all options for the closure of a soft tissue wound. The use of these various techniques depends on the size and location of the wound. The patient presents with a human bite wound 6 hours after it occurred. Given its increased risk for infection, the wound should not be closed unless necessary to reduce high-risk complications involving neurovascular or bony structures. It should be left open after debridement covered by a sterile dressing, which will reduce the risk for developing a wound site infection. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 40 of 50 'I 40 . A 38-year-old man has vomited small amounts of bright red blood on several occasions over the past 9 months . He has a duodenal ulcer and has had four episodes of abdominal pain and indigestion over the past 3 years , with the most recent episode occurring 5 months ago . Over the past year, he has had severe , persistent diarrhea , with four to six stools daily. Current examination shows a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1° F) and marked abdominal tenderness . The most appropriate next step is measurement of which of the following serum concentrations? A) Amylase B) a -Antitrypsin 1 C) Carcinoembryonic antigen D) Cortisol E) Gastrin Correct Answer: E. Gastrin is physiologically produced by G cells in the gastric antrum and functions to stimulate parietal cells within the gastric body to produce hydrochloric acid. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, the constellation of findings associated with gastrinoma, stems from a gastrin-secreting tumor located typically within the pancreas or duodenum. It results in excessive production of acid by the gastric parietal cells. This can lead to recurrent, chronic duodenal or jejunal ulcers, which can present with abdominal pain, diarrhea secondary to malabsorption, and possible hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. The initial step in evaluation of a gastrinoma is to measure the serum gastrin concentration. If abnormal, a secretin stimulation test should be performed, which would demonstrate elevated gastrin concentrations after administration of secretin, opposite of the normal, physiologic inhibition. Cross-sectional imaging should then be performed to determine the location of the gastrinoma for planning of surgical resection. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D Amylase {Choice A) is an enzyme that assists in the digestion of carbohydrates and is primarily secreted in saliva and from the exocrine pancreas. Increased amylase activity may indicate an underlying pathology of either the salivary glands (e.g., parotitis) or pancreas (e.g., pancreatitis). arAntitrypsin {Choice B) deficiency results in the early development of panacinar emphysema and cirrhosis. It is a hereditary disease resulting from misfolding of arantitrypsin, which aggregates in hepatocytes. This results in hepatocyte injury and progression to cirrhosis at a young age. The lack of functional arantitrypsin release also results in an imbalance of proteases and anti-proteases in the lung parenchyma, resulting in the destruction of alveolar septa and development of panacinar emphysema. Carcinoembryonic antigen {Choice C) is a nonspecific, often-increased tumor marker associated with colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Cortisol {Choice D) is typically measured in the evaluation of Cushing syndrome or Addison disease. Cushing syndrome commonly presents with hypertension, moon facies, abdominal striae, osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, and amenorrhea. Addison disease presents as primary adrenal insufficiency with generalized malaise, fatigue, myalgias, weight loss, weakness, hypoglycemia, and occasionally hypotension, with associated skin and mucosal hyperpigmentation. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 41 of 50 'I 41 . A 12-year-old boy has had weakness , pallor, and black, shiny stools for 5 days . He has had no abdominal pain or other symptoms . Laboratory studies show: Hematocrit 26% Mean corpuscular volume 70 µm 3 Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 22% Hb/cell An abdominal scintigram , using technetium 99m pertechnetate, shows uptake in the right lower quadrant separate from the activity in the stomach , kidneys , and bladder. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Henoch-Schonlein purpura B) lleocecal intussusception C) Juvenile colonic polyp D) Meckel diverticulum E) Ulcerative colitis CorrectAnswer: D. Meckel diverticulum is one of the most common causes of painless, bloody stools in children. A Meckel diverticulum results from persistence of the vitelline duct and can demonstrate ectopic, functional gastric or pancreatic tissue. It can present with acute or chronic hematochezia or melena, often painless, which can lead to the development of iron deficiency anemia. It typically presents in childhood, most commonly before age 2 years, although because of its indolent nature, it may not be diagnosed until later in life. It is commonly located 61 cm (2 ft) proximal to the ileocecal valve and is 5 cm (2 in) in length. Because of its location, it serves as a potential lead-point for intussusception. A technetium 99 m pertechnetate scan demonstrates uptake in the right lower quadrant, corresponding with ectopic gastric mucosa within the Meckel diverticulum. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Henoch-Schonlein purpura (Choice A) is a small-vessel vasculitis that occurs in children and typically presents with gravity-dependent purpura (e.g., buttocks, legs, and feet), arthralgias, hematuria, and abdominal pain (e.g., intussusception). lleocecal intussusception (Choice B) occurs from telescoping of the terminal ileum into the cecum. This can result in intermittent abdominal pain from compromised blood supply to the intussuscepted bowel. This typically occurs in children. It can present with 'currant jelly' stools if there is associated bowel infarction. Painless melena would not be expected. Juvenile colonic polyps (Choice C) can be associated with a variety of polyposis syndromes such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and juvenile polyposis syndrome. These syndromes feature primarily hamartomatous polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract and are associated with an increased risk for colorectal carcinoma. Meckel diverticulum is a much more common cause of painless melena in a child. Ulcerative colitis (Choice E) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that results in mucosal and submucosal ulceration and inflammation that progresses retrograde along the colon from the rectum. This typically presents with chronic bloody diarrhea, tenesmus, and abdominal pain. While inflammatory bowel disease can occur in children, it would not typically present with painless melena. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 42 of 50 'I 42 . A 19-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after his motorcycle collided head-on with a truck . No loss of consciousness at the scene is reported . On arrival , he is agitated but oriented to person , place , and time . He responds to verbal commands . Supplemental oxygen and intravenous fluids are administered . His pulse is 115/min, respirations are 18/min , and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. There are multiple abrasions over the forehead , chest , abdomen , and right lower extremity . The pupils are equal and reactive to light. The trachea is midline , and breath sounds are equal bilaterally . Heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is mildly distended , soft , and diffusely tender . His hemoglobin concentration is 11 .8 g/dL , and leukocyte count is 14,000/mm 3 Urinary catheterization yields clear urine . X-rays of the cervical spine and pelvis show no abnormalities . • An x-ray of the chest shows a moderate amount of free intra-abdominal air under the diaphragm . Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Lateral decubitus x-ray B) CT scan of the abdomen C) Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy D) Diagnostic peritoneal lavage E) Laparotomy Correct Answer: E. Laparotomy of the abdomen is indicated for the emergent investigation and management of a perforated hollow viscus. Abdominal pain, distention, tenderness to palpation, anemia, leukocytosis, and x-ray evidence of pneumoperitoneum following trauma is consistent with a perforated viscus and early peritonitis. Peritonitis requires emergent surgical laparotomy to identify and repair any perforation, lavage the peritoneum and prevent sepsis, exsanguination, and bowel necrosis. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Lateral decubitus x-ray (Choice A) of the abdomen can be utilized to better delineate the presence of pneumoperitoneum if there are indeterminate findings on prior x-rays. The patient should be positioned with the left side against the table, which will allow for visualization of free intra-abdominal air along the surface of the liver. CT scan of the abdomen (Choice B) and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (Choice C) are not indicated in the emergent management of an acute abdomen. The patient presents following trauma with pneumoperitoneum, a life-threatening condition that requires emergent laparotomy for definitive evaluation and management. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (Choice D) is used for the evaluation of hemoperitoneum in traumatic abdominal injury. While it has mostly been replaced by evaluation with ultrasound or CT scan, it may be useful in situations with equivocal results or low-resource settings. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 43 of 50 X"

    "explanation": {
      "correct_answer_explanation": "Complete small-bowel obstruction (SBO) is the most likely diagnosis in a patient with previous abdominal surgery presenting with a history of abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation. Obstruction of the small bowel occurs from partial or complete blockage of the small bowel lumen and typically presents with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Partial SBO allows a degree of continued flatus with diminished stooling, and complete SBO will result in obstipation (no passage of stool or flatus). SBO has many potential etiologies, although the most common are post-surgical peritoneal adhesions and hernias. On physical examination, SBO typically presents with abdominal tenderness, distention, tympany to percussion, and borborygmi (high-pitched, hyperactive bowel sounds). Potential complications of SBO include bowel rupture and/or necrosis, which can result in sudden-onset peritonitic abdominal signs such as rebound tenderness and guarding. Abdominal x-rays typically demonstrate multiple air-fluid levels in the setting of dilated small bowel loops. Management requires bowel rest and intravenous hydration followed by surgical intervention if the obstruction does not autoreduce. Partial SBO may resolve with monitoring, supportive care, and bowel rest, whereas complete obstruction or any complicated partial obstruction generally requires management through exploratory laparotomy. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Acute cholecystitis (Choice A) presents with fever, abdominal pain, and tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant, often in a patient with a history of gallstones. It would be unlikely to result in small bowel obstruction unless it was complicated by the formation of a cholecystoduodenal fistula leading to gallstone ileus. Colon cancer (Choice B) most commonly occurs in the rectosigmoid region of the large bowel. Lesions within the ascending colon, by convention, typically result in an exophytic mass and slow bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia. Cancers within the descending and rectosigmoid colon are more likely to be infiltrative, resulting in partial obstruction of the large bowel. Colon cancer is unlikely to result in complete obstruction. lieus secondary to renal failure (Choice D) is less likely for this patient given her normal urea nitrogen, sodium, and potassium concentrations. lieus refers to intestinal hypomotility without a mechanical obstruction, most commonly occurring following surgery or in the setting of electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., end-stage kidney disease resulting in hyperkalemia), and typically presents with diffuse small and large bowel dilatation. A perforated viscus (Choice E) typically presents with acute-onset diffuse abdominal pain, with findings of abdominal rigidity, rebound tenderness, and guarding on physical examination ('peritoneal signs'). X-rays may demonstrate evidence of pneumoperitoneum, preferably obtained in an erect or left lateral decubitus position. Emergent surgical laparotomy is required for diagnosis and management of the underlying etiology. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 44 of 50 'I 44 . A 25-year-old construction worker has had fever and a painful , swollen right hand for 2 days . His temperature is 39 °C (102 .2°F) . The dorsum of the hand is swollen , erythematous , and tender; there is a small traumatic laceration on the dorsum of the hand with a beefy-red expanding margin and red streaks extending up the arm . The axillary lymph nodes are palpable and tender . Which of the following is the most likely pathogen? A) Bacteroides fragilis F) Enterococcus faecalis B) Clostridium difficile G) Escherichia coli C) Clostridium perfringens H) Staphylococcus epidermidis D) Clostridium tetani I) Streptococcus pneumoniae E) Enterobacter cloacae J) Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) J. Correct Answer: Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A) and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common causes of bacterial lymphadenitis. Cutaneous erythema and swelling at a site of inoculation, with streaking along lymphatic drainage territories and associated tender lymphadenopathy is characteristic of lymphadenitis. Bartonella henselae is another bacterial cause of lymphadenitis related to cat scratches ('Cat scratch disease'), although given the patient's injury secondary to a construction-related laceration, Streptococcus pyogenes lymphadenitis is more likely.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Bacteroides fragilis is a normal component of the gastrointestinal microbiota. It only results in infections when displaced from the colon such as following surgery or trauma where it has the potential to cause bacteremia, intra-abdominal infections, peritonitis, and subcutaneous abscesses. Clostridium difficile (Choice B) is an opportunistic infection that most commonly occurs following antibiotic alterations of the colonic microbiome. It can present with watery or bloody diarrhea depending on the severity of the infection. Clostridium perfringens (Choice C) can result in myonecrosis (gas gangrene) following traumatic injury. Its spores can also survive in undercooked food, and if ingested, can result in food poisoning. Clostridium tetani (Choice D) is the bacterial cause of tetanus, resulting in the development of spastic paralysis following inoculation via a penetrating traumatic wound. Enterobacter cloacae (Choice E) is a gram-negative rod that can result in a variety of diseases such as urinary tract infection, pneumonia, skin and soft-tissue infections, endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, ophthalmic infections, and bacteremia. It is not a common cause of lymphadenitis. Enterococcus faecalis (Choice F) is found in normal colonic flora but may result in urinary or biliary tract infections, or subacute endocarditis following gastrointestinal or genitourinary invasive procedures. Escherichia coli (Choice G) is a gram-negative rod with multiple strains presenting with different clinical symptoms. These range from the watery diarrhea of enterotoxigenic E. coli to bloody diarrhea and dysentery in enteroinvasive and enterohemorrhagic E. coli. Additionally, E. coli is a common cause of urinary tract infections such as cystitis and pyelonephritis. Staphylococcus epidermidis (Choice H) is a normal flora of the skin and nose. It can be associated with intravascular catheter and joint prosthesis infections. Streptococcus pneumoniae (Choice I) is a gram-positive diplococcus associated with otitis media, pneumonia, sinusitis, and meningitis. It does not typically cause lymphadenitis. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 45 of 50 'I 45 . A 63-year-old man has had dysphagia and chest pain during meals for 4 months . He has a 6-year history of gastroesophageal reflux . He has limited his intake to liquids for 3 weeks because he regurgitates solid food . Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms? A) Disordered neuromuscular transmission in the esophagus B) Disordered neuromuscular transmission in the oropharynx C) Failure of oropharyngeal propulsion D) Paraesophageal hiatal hernia E) Stricture of the distal esoi:ihagus Correct Answer: E. A stricture of the distal esophagus is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The patient presents with chronic solid-food dysphagia and chest pain following multiple years of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERO). Chronic GERO, especially if under-managed, raises the risk for development of a distal esophageal stricture. The chronic exposure of the distal esophagus to reflux of gastric acid results in recurrent inflammation leading to potential fibrosis and strictures. Esophageal strictures characteristically present with solid-food dysphagia and regurgitation since the decreased esophageal luminal diameter impedes the passage of solid foods worse than liquid foods. Chronic GERO increases the patient's risk for development of Barrett esophagus (intestinal metaplasia) and esophageal adenocarcinoma, which should be considered in the patient's management and diagnostic evaluation. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Disordered neuromuscular transmission in the esophagus (Choice A) refers to achalasia, which is a type of esophageal dysmotility disorder resulting from deficient peristalsis along the length of the esophagus and impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. It manifests as dysphagia to both solids and liquids, odynophagia, weight loss, halitosis, and regurgitation of undigested food. It is diagnosed through a barium swallow plus esophageal manometry. Disordered neuromuscular transmission in the oropharynx (Choice B) and failure of oropharyngeal propulsion (Choice C) typically occur from impaired cranial nerve function. Oropharyngeal motility is dictated by the coordinated movement of several muscles (e.g., palate, tongue, pharynx), which are primarily innervated by the facial nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve, vagus nerve, and hypoglossal nerve. Underlying neurologic dysfunction (e.g., stroke) can result in incoordination of the oropharyngeal muscles, which can present as transfer dysphagia related to difficulty propelling the food bolus from the oropharynx to the hypopharynx and esophagus. Paraesophageal hiatal hernia (Choice D) results from protrusion of the gastric fundus through the esophageal diaphragmatic hiatus. The gastroesophageal junction remains in its normal location. This can result in obstructive symptoms as the herniated gastric fundus exerts mass effect on the adjacent distal esophagus. The patient demonstrates risk factors for a reflux-associated distal esophageal stricture, which is more common. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 46 of 50 'I 46 . A 57-year-old man comes to the physician because of persistent increasingly severe left-sided chest pain for 1 month . He works as an industrial engineer . Examination shows absent breath sounds and dullness to percussion over the lower portion of the left hemithorax . An x-ray of the chest shows a left-sided pleural effusion with an extensive peripheral soft-tissue density . Thoracentesis shows a bloody, exudative effusion ; cultures are negative . Cytology of pleural fluid shows malignant cells of uncertain type . An open biopsy specimen shows a dimorphic picture ; there are areas of spindle cells with numerous mitotic figures and areas of cuboidal epithelial cells . Exposure to which of the following agents is the most likely cause of his condition? A) Asbestos B) Nickel C) Talc D) Tobacco E) Toluene diisocyanate Correct Answer: A. Asbestos exposure commonly occurs in the setting of roofing, plumbing, and shipbuilding. It increases the risk for pulmonary asbestosis, characterized by the development of pleural calcified plaques and potential lower-lobe-predominant interstitial fibrotic changes. It also increases the risk for the development of bronchogenic carcinoma and mesothelioma. The patient presents with a left-sided pleural effusion with extensive peripheral soft-tissue density and cytology of the pleural fluid demonstrating malignant cells. Biopsy shows spindle cells with numerous mitotic figures. This presentation and associated x-ray and pathologic findings are typical for pleural mesothelioma. Mesothelioma often presents with pleural soft-tissue thickening and an exudative, often hemorrhagic, pleural effusion. Asbestos exposure is the main risk factor for mesothelioma, while smoking tobacco is not an associated risk factor. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E.",
        "B": "Nickel exposure is a common cause of contact dermatitis, which is a T-lymphocyte mediated type IV hypersensitivity reaction that results in an erythematous, pruritic rash in the location of exposure.",
        "C": "Infarction of the skin can occur in the setting of protein C or S deficiency after the administration of warfarin. During the initiation of warfarin, the potential for a hypercoagulable state exists, especially in patients with protein C or S deficiency. This can result in warfarin-associated skin necrosis characterized by patches of necrotic skin, not ulcerations.",
        "D": "Necrobiosis lipoidica is a rare dermatologic condition that often affects the shins. It is a chronic granulomatous skin disease that is associated with diabetes mellitus. It typically presents with reddish or violaceous papules that progress to yellow-brown telangiectatic plaques. Ulceration of the lesions can occur. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 50 of 50"

The initial airway assessment determines whether the patient is at risk for compromise to the pathway of airflow from the external environment into the lungs. Examples of airway compromise include structural lesions (angioedema, facial or neck trauma, airway foreign bodies, expanding neck hematomas), space-filling lesions (pharyngeal, laryngeal, tracheal, or bronchial hemorrhage), uncontrolled emesis, or loss of airway protective reflexes (altered mental status). Airway management requires immediate priority whenever a compromising lesion is detected, and an expanding neck hematoma under arterial pressure (pulsatile) may threaten the pathway of airflow within minutes. Endotracheal intubation is the best next step to ensure an intact pathway for air exchange.",

It typically occurs in older persons and may affect any joint. It is commonly associated with the fingers and wrists because of repetitive use, and the hips and knees because of chronic weight bearing, especially in persons with obesity. It is not associated with infectious or inflammatory symptoms and is generally insidious in onset. Patients typically report chronic pain in a joint that is worse with movement or exertion and is improved with rest, often with limited range of motion in a joint because of underlying joint space narrowing and associated pain. Fever, chills, erythema over a joint, traumatic injury, or extra-articular manifestations (e.g., rashes, uveitis, urethritis) suggest an alternate, inflammatory, or infectious cause. Imaging may demonstrate osteophytosis, subchondral cystic or sclerotic changes, and space narrowing of joints. Arthrocentesis typically demonstrates leukocytes of less than 2,000/mm 3 with no additional abnormalities. Treatment includes rest, physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular injections (e.g., cortisone), and joint replacement surgery for severe or refractory cases.",

It is classically worse with a straight-leg raise maneuver, which stretches the lumbar root and elicits radicular pain, often described as \"shooting down the leg.\" Osteoarthritis of the knee (Choice C) is common in older persons and those with obesity. Pain with osteoarthritis of the knee classically occurs in the knee joint itself and would be unlikely to radiate to the groin or thigh. It may also be associated with knee joint instability. Rheumatoid arthritis of the hip (Choice D) typically is worse in the morning (after a period of rest) with prolonged joint stiffness and improves with use. Extra-articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis may also be present such as rheumatoid nodules, pulmonary fibrosis, vasculitis, Sjogren syndrome, and dermatologic manifestations. Trochanteric bursitis (Choice E) presents with localized pain and swelling, often with overlying erythema in the area of the affected bursa. A common risk factor is prolonged pressure applied to the bursa. The associated pain generally does not radiate. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 5 of 50 'I"

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) allows for the potential direct visualization of the lesion location, bile duct scrapings or biopsy for definitive diagnosis, and stenting of any associated occlusion.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) in the setting of hemodynamic stability is best evaluated using a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. BAT is commonly associated with injury involving the liver, spleen, and kidneys, and can include hematomas, contusions, lacerations, and in severe cases, devascularization and uncontrolled hemorrhage. Hematuria is highly suggestive of renal or retroperitoneal bleeding or hematoma. In contrast to stable BAT, hemodynamically unstable BAT is evaluated first with focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) followed by an exploratory laparotomy if positive, whereas stable BAT permits time for more thorough evaluation and the additional detail offered in a CT scan. Patients should also receive intravenous fluids, pain control, and supportive care as needed. There should be close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamics, as decompensation may occur rapidly if bleeding is present or continues unabated.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Measurement of serum creatinine concentration has a role in the evaluation of renal function following BAT but would not have an immediate role in the evaluation of a traumatic renal injury until such an injury is identified on a CT scan.",
        "C": "Cystography and cystoscopy (Choice E) have roles in the workup of hematuria when a bladder source is suspected. Retrograde urethrography (Choice D) permits evaluation of the urethra as a source of hematuria. However, in undifferentiated cases of BAT, a CT scan permits evaluation of the liver, spleen, kidneys, ureters, retroperitoneum, bladder, bony pelvis, and prostate, and should precede dedicated bladder or urethral imaging. Exploratory laparotomy (Choice F) is the correct choice in the management of unstable BAT, as it permits the control of hemorrhage and the repair of identified injuries. In stable cases, imaging precedes surgical intervention. r \" , r-- r , 'I 11 . A 27-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 6-day history of right flank pain that radiates to her right groin . She is otherwise asymptomatic . She has a 6-year history of Crohn disease and has undergone three resections of the small bowel , mostly involving the distal ileum , as well as resection of the right colon . Current medications include mesalamine , folic acid , and a daily multivitamin . Her temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F) , pulse is 100/min , respirations are 16/min , and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows a well-healed surgical scar at the midline and mild tenderness of the right flank . A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows a calculus in the middle of the right ureter. Which of the following is the most likely precipitating mechanism of this patient's current condition? A) Excessive intake of calcium and vitamin D B) Hyperparathyroidism C) Increased absorption of oxalate D) Increased secretion of cystine E) Increased secretion of uric acid Correct Answer: C. Nephrolithiasis or ureterolithiasis describes the formation of calculi within the urinary collecting system, otherwise known as kidney or ureteral calculi. Calcium oxalate calculi are the most common type (making up generally 80% of all urinary tract calculi), though calcium phosphate, struvite, uric acid, and proteinaceous calculi (e.g., cystine) are also seen. Crohn disease is a common risk factor for oxalate calculi. It results in increased gastrointestinal absorption of oxalates, leading to an increased serum concentration and increased urinary excretion. When paired with a calcium counterion, oxalates precipitate in the urine and may lead to calculi formation. Symptoms of kidney or ureteral calculi include colicky flank pain radiating to the groin, gross hematuria, and difficulty voiding. Complications include obstructive hydronephrosis, post-renal azotemia, and superimposed infection such as pyelonephritis. Diagnosis is through noncontrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. Treatment varies depending on the size, location, and complicating features. Small, uncomplicated calculi often pass without intervention, whereas large, obstructing, or infected calculi may require antibiotics, surgical removal, ureteral stenting, or percutaneous nephrostomy. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E. Excessive intake of calcium and vitamin D (Choice A) can promote the development of urinary tract calculi as calcium is frequently the precipitant counterion to oxalate in urine. The amount of calcium absorbed from the patient's use of a daily multivitamin would be unlikely to supply a sufficient concentration to cause hypercalcemia.",
        "D": "Increased secretion of cystine is a potential mechanism for nephrolithiasis and is generally hereditary. The mechanism relates to impaired cystine resorption in the proximal convoluted tubule, which results in cystinuria. Cystine is poorly soluble and precipitates easily into calculi. The condition generally presents in childhood and would be unlikely to manifest initially in an adult patient with known Crohn disease. Increased secretion of uric acid (Choice E) occurs most commonly in states of decreased urine volume and dry climates; increased pH also promotes uric acid precipitation. Urate calculi are associated with hyperuricemia (e.g., gout) and are also common in cases of increased cell turnover (e.g., tumor lysis syndrome). r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 12 of 50 'I"

Vital signs may show hypertension or hypotension depending on cardiac function. If left heart failure ensues, signs and symptoms of pulmonary edema such as shortness of breath, cough, tachypnea, hypoxia, and crackles may be present. If right heart failure occurs, peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, ascites, jugular venous distention, and hypotension may be present. ST-segment elevations in leads 11, Ill, and a VF suggest an inferior wall myocardial infarction, which classically occurs from occlusion of the right coronary artery. Cardiogenic shock is a potential complication. In cardiogenic shock, there is severe dysfunction of the cardiac myocytes, resulting in markedly decreased contractility. Pulmonary artery catheterization typically demonstrates decreased cardiac output and increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure because of the underlying systolic cardiac dysfunction. Systemic vascular resistance is commonly increased as a physiologic attempt to maintain mean arterial pressure in the setting of reduced cardiac output and peripheral perfusion.",

In young boys, such upregulation of androgens presents with precocious puberty, while in women it presents with masculinization (e.g., amenorrhea, hirsutism, temporal balding, acne, deepening of the voice, clitoromegaly). Gynecomastia and a testicular nodule in a postpubertal, otherwise healthy male is suggestive of a functional estrogen secreting Leydig cell tumor.

Underlying respiratory impairment (e.g., history of smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) may further exacerbate hypoventilation. Vital signs may disclose bradypnea and low arterial oxygen saturation. Physical examination will demonstrate diminished respiratory effort, often with reduced breath sounds at the lung bases because of atelectasis and inadequate diaphragmatic excursion. Arterial blood gas analysis may disclose an acidic pH with increases in both Pco and HCO along with low arterial oxygen -, 2 3 tension. Hypoxemia will improve with the administration of supplemental oxygen, whereas hypercapnia will persist until the resolution of ventilatory insufficiency.

Increased metabolic demands (Choice D) generally result in increased minute ventilation. The respiratory system compensates for the increased production of carbon dioxide and organic acids through increased ventilation. Increased physiologic dead space (Choice E) may occur in cases where the alveolar membrane no longer functions correctly or is not appropriately perfused (e.g., pulmonary embolism).

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cholangiocarcinoma, a malignancy of the bile ducts, characteristically presents late in its course with signs of biliary tree obstruction, including abdominal discomfort, weight loss, nausea, jaundice, and pruritus. Patients may report dark urine or light, pale stools. Many persons have no risk factors; however, those with a history of cirrhosis, sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis B or C, liver fluke infection, and ulcerative colitis may be at increased risk. Diagnosis occurs through imaging of the abdomen with CT scan or MRI, which may disclose a variety of findings from bile duct wall thickening, a focal mass, or only dilation of bile ducts proximal to the presumed lesion location. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) allows for the potential direct visualization of the lesion location, bile duct scrapings or biopsy for definitive diagnosis, and stenting of any associated occlusion. Laboratory analysis typically discloses obstructive (direct) hyperbilirubinemia and increased alkaline phosphatase activity. Treatment includes surgical resection and chemotherapy; however, the condition is often late-stage or terminal at the time of diagnosis. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Measurement of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration (Choice A) is sometimes increased in cholangiocarcinoma; however, it is nonspecific and is also increased in colorectal carcinoma along with other various malignancies. It may be followed during treatment to assess treatment response but does not have a specific role in diagnosis. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA scan) (Choice C) evaluates the patency of the hepatobiliary tree and gallbladder. It is useful in cases of suspected acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, or biliary obstruction with indeterminate ultrasonography findings. It does not permit tissue sampling such as biopsy or therapeutic interventions such as stenting. Liver biopsy (Choice D) is useful in the diagnosis of conditions such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, though cholangiocarcinoma is generally small and confined to the biliary tree. These features may result in false negative liver biopsy results and should prompt targeted sampling via ERCP. Exploratory laparotomy (Choice E) involves the surgical evaluation of the peritoneal cavity and is commonly employed in the diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma, bowel obstruction, peritonitis, and undifferentiated cases of an acute abdomen. It does not have an immediate role in the diagnosis or management of cholangiocarcinoma. r \" , r-- r ,",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Congenital heart disease is often subdivided into cyanotic and noncyanotic types depending on the direction of blood shunting. Structural heart defects that result in flow of deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary to systemic circulations (a right-to-left shunt) classically present with cyanosis, respiratory distress, hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension generally within 1 to 7 days after birth. Common culprit lesions include truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great vessels, tricuspid atresia, tetralogy of Fallo!, and total anomalous pulmonary venous return. These lesions require the concomitant presence of a left-to-right shunt (patent ductus arteriosus) to allow for a degree of blood oxygenation. Without a left-to-right shunt, a complete absence of oxygenation can occur because of the separated circulatory systems, which is incompatible with life. In cases of a suspected congenital cyanotic heart defect, intravenous prostaglandin should be started, which maintains a patent ductus arteriosus. Administration of indomethacin or similar nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medications should be avoided, as these will result in closure of the ductus arteriosus. Echocardiography is required to determine the structural defects to confirm the right-to-left shunt and to assist in operative planning.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "CT scan of the chest can provide structural but only limited functional information about the heart, whereas an echocardiography permits analysis of structural defects, pressure, velocity, and flow of blood which is important in understanding the hemodynamics associated with structural heart disease. Administration of indomethacin (Choice C) would result in closure of the ductus arteriosus and could worsen the degree of right-to-left shunting with resultant severe hypoxia. Administration of surfactant (Choice D) may have an adjunct role in certain cases of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome because of the inadequate production of surfactant in the setting of premature birth; however, the pulmonary function in congenital heart disease is often not affected. Cardiac catheterization (Choice E) may be necessary to further assist in evaluation of the heart anatomy and intracardiac pressures, but it is not the best next step, as echocardiography is often sufficient and does not require an invasive procedure. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 18 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cholangiocarcinoma, a malignancy of the bile ducts, characteristically presents late in its course with signs of biliary tree obstruction, including abdominal discomfort, weight loss, nausea, jaundice, and pruritus. Patients may report dark urine or light, pale stools. Many persons have no risk factors; however, those with a history of cirrhosis, sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis B or C, liver fluke infection, and ulcerative colitis may be at increased risk. Diagnosis occurs through imaging of the abdomen with CT scan or MRI, which may disclose a variety of findings from bile duct wall thickening, a focal mass, or only dilation of bile ducts proximal to the presumed lesion location. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) allows for the potential direct visualization of the lesion location, bile duct scrapings or biopsy for definitive diagnosis, and stenting of any associated occlusion. Laboratory analysis typically discloses obstructive (direct) hyperbilirubinemia and increased alkaline phosphatase activity. Treatment includes surgical resection and chemotherapy; however, the condition is often late-stage or terminal at the time of diagnosis. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Measurement of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration (Choice A) is sometimes increased in cholangiocarcinoma; however, it is nonspecific and is also increased in colorectal carcinoma along with other various malignancies. It may be followed during treatment to assess treatment response but does not have a specific role in diagnosis. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA scan) (Choice C) evaluates the patency of the hepatobiliary tree and gallbladder. It is useful in cases of suspected acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, or biliary obstruction with indeterminate ultrasonography findings. It does not permit tissue sampling such as biopsy or therapeutic interventions such as stenting. Liver biopsy (Choice D) is useful in the diagnosis of conditions such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, though cholangiocarcinoma is generally small and confined to the biliary tree. These features may result in false negative liver biopsy results and should prompt targeted sampling via ERCP. Exploratory laparotomy (Choice E) involves the surgical evaluation of the peritoneal cavity and is commonly employed in the diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma, bowel obstruction, peritonitis, and undifferentiated cases of an acute abdomen. It does not have an immediate role in the diagnosis or management of cholangiocarcinoma. r \" , r-- r ,",

        "A": "Colloid and isotonic crystalloid solution is incorrect as colloids are generally not deficient in the setting of burns (e.g., albumin). The administration of isotonic crystalloids alone is the standard of care for resuscitative fluid administration as it provides the most direct intravascular benefit. Fresh frozen plasma (Choice B) is appropriate for use as a resuscitation fluid in cases of severe blood loss as part of a balanced resuscitation treatment plan. It is also used in reversing anticoagulation when prothrombin complex concentrates are not available. It does not have a primary role in the fluid resuscitation of patients with burns. Hypertonic crystalloid solution only (Choice C) is used in the management of acute hyponatremia with neurologic deficits and to reduce cerebral edema in cases of elevated intracranial pressure. It does not have a primary role in the fluid resuscitation of patients with burns. Packed red blood cells (Choice E) are used as a component of resuscitation in cases of hemorrhagic shock.

Ovarian cancer classically presents late in the course and is often metastatic and invasive at the time of discovery. Presenting features are often nonspecific and may include weight loss, abdominal discomfort or distention, ascites, and gastrointestinal symptoms including early satiety, bloating, nausea, cramping, and bowel obstruction.

Treatment includes surgical resection and debulking plus chemotherapy. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to maximize survival. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, E, and G. Colon cancer (Choice A) may present with symptoms of a bowel obstruction, especially if left-sided (descending colon). Classic symptoms of left-sided colon cancer include weight loss, tenesmus, constipation, narrow stools, and large bowel obstruction. Right-sided (ascending colon) lesions classically present with occult bleeding and iron deficiency anemia. Endometrial cancer (Choice B) classically arises in older women who have been chronically exposed to uninterrupted estrogen stimulation (e.g., obesity, nulliparity, using tamoxifen, using exogenous hormones). Any unexplained vaginal bleeding in a postmenopausal woman should be investigated, as endometrial carcinoma may be present. Gastric cancer (Choice C) classically presents with weight loss, early satiety, and melena in a patient with a history of smoking, peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis, or frequent consumption of nitrate-containing foods. Gastric outlet obstruction is a potential complication, which presents as nausea, left upper quadrant and epigastric discomfort, and nonbilious emesis containing partially digested food. Metastatic breast cancer (Choice D) most commonly spreads to the bone, lung, and brain, and would be less likely to present with omental and peritoneal metastases.

The mitral valve is the most commonly affected. Antibodies to M protein enhance host defenses against group A streptococci but can result in an autoimmune attack against self-antigens through molecular mimicry.

        "A": "Aortic stenosis presents with a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur that is heard best at the upper right sternal border and radiates to the carotid arteries. It classically occurs secondary to age-related fibrotic and calcific changes of the valve but can occur earlier in life in cases of bicuspid aortic valve or chronic rheumatic disease. Tetralogy of Fallo! (Choice C) consists of pulmonary infundibular stenosis, overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect, and right ventricular hypertrophy, resulting in a right-to-left shunt with cyanosis first noted in infancy. The murmur heard with Tetralogy of Fallo! relates to the underlying ventricular septal defect, characterized by a holosystolic murmur heard best in the lower left sternal border, and to the pulmonic stenosis, characterized by a systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur in the pulmonic listening area. Tricuspid regurgitation (Choice D) demonstrates a holosystolic murmur heard best in the lower left sternal border. The tricuspid valve is less commonly affected than the mitral or aortic valves in ARF. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) (Choice E) is characterized by a holosystolic murmur heard best in the lower left sternal border. VSD generally presents at birth and is not associated with ARF. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 23 of 50 'I"

To prevent further progression of the dissection flap, controlling the patient's heart rate and blood pressure is the first priority. An intravenous ~-adrenergic blocking agent should be used with a goal of decreasing the heart rate to approximately 60/min and the blood pressure to less than 100 to 120 mm Hg systolic and 60 to 80 mm Hg diastolic. Decreasing the heart rate helps prevent the advancement of the dissection flap and resultant occlusion of branch vessels by limiting the pulse pressure differential. Labetalol is a nonspecific adrenoreceptor blocker that targets both ar and ~radrenoreceptors, making it an ideal choice for the management of the patient's heart rate, cardiac contractility, and vascular resistance.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Venous insufficiency presents with dependent, pitting edema that improves with compression and elevation, along with paresthesia and hyperpigmentation of the skin (e.g., stasis dermatitis). In severe cases, chronic circulatory insufficiency can result in skin breakdown, leading to the development of open ulcers, classically along the medial aspect of the ankle. Venous insufficiency often results from deep venous thrombosis with resultant damage to the valves. When the thrombus resolves, the residual vessel may be dysfunctional from damage to the valve leaflets, valve annulus, or increased diameter of the native vessel. This prevents the vessel from functioning effectively and results in stagnant or retrograde venous flow secondary to gravity. Treatment includes wound care for the ulcer and measures to reverse the venous insufficiency such as optimizing venous return, diuresis, and improving circulatory function by optimizing cardiac, vascular, and kidney function.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cholangiocarcinoma, a malignancy of the bile ducts, characteristically presents late in its course with signs of biliary tree obstruction, including abdominal discomfort, weight loss, nausea, jaundice, and pruritus. Patients may report dark urine or light, pale stools. Many persons have no risk factors; however, those with a history of cirrhosis, sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis B or C, liver fluke infection, and ulcerative colitis may be at increased risk. Diagnosis occurs through imaging of the abdomen with CT scan or MRI, which may disclose a variety of findings from bile duct wall thickening, a focal mass, or only dilation of bile ducts proximal to the presumed lesion location. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) allows for the potential direct visualization of the lesion location, bile duct scrapings or biopsy for definitive diagnosis, and stenting of any associated occlusion. Laboratory analysis typically discloses obstructive (direct) hyperbilirubinemia and increased alkaline phosphatase activity. Treatment includes surgical resection and chemotherapy; however, the condition is often late-stage or terminal at the time of diagnosis. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Measurement of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration (Choice A) is sometimes increased in cholangiocarcinoma; however, it is nonspecific and is also increased in colorectal carcinoma along with other various malignancies. It may be followed during treatment to assess treatment response but does not have a specific role in diagnosis. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA scan) (Choice C) evaluates the patency of the hepatobiliary tree and gallbladder. It is useful in cases of suspected acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, or biliary obstruction with indeterminate ultrasonography findings. It does not permit tissue sampling such as biopsy or therapeutic interventions such as stenting. Liver biopsy (Choice D) is useful in the diagnosis of conditions such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, though cholangiocarcinoma is generally small and confined to the biliary tree. These features may result in false negative liver biopsy results and should prompt targeted sampling via ERCP. Exploratory laparotomy (Choice E) involves the surgical evaluation of the peritoneal cavity and is commonly employed in the diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma, bowel obstruction, peritonitis, and undifferentiated cases of an acute abdomen. It does not have an immediate role in the diagnosis or management of cholangiocarcinoma. r \" , r-- r ,",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) commonly presents with symptoms of hearing loss, vertigo, and ataxia, often slow in onset and progressive over a subacute to chronic period. Classically, these tumors occur at the cerebellopontine angle of the brain stem and are associated with neurofibromatosis. They may exert mass effect on cranial nerves within their proximity or invade the nerves from which they arise, often the facial nerve, vestibulocochlear nerve, or adjacent nerves. Facial nerve involvement manifests as facial asymmetry because of loss of skeletal muscle innervation and occasionally presents with diminished taste perception involving the ipsilateral anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Vestibulocochlear nerve palsy can present with diminished hearing or tinnitus (cochlear branch) on the ipsilateral side, and vertigo or ataxia may occur (vestibular branch) because of impaired proprioception from loss of input from the ipsilateral vestibule. In cases of larger masses, disruption of brain stem tracts and increased intracranial pressure can result.",

It may be caused by bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections. Cranial nerve deficits may result, but a chronic presentation involving cranial nerves only would be rare.",
        "D": "Otosclerosis results in dysfunction of the ossicles and causes conductive hearing loss; neurologic symptoms of ataxia would be unlikely. Pituitary adenoma (Choice E) can present with mass-like symptoms such as a headache or bitemporal hemianopsia, or with symptoms caused by the functional production of a hormone from the tumor (e.g., galactorrhea secondary to a prolactinoma). Because of the position of the pituitary gland within the sella turcica, symptoms involving the facial nerve or vestibulocochlear nerve would be unlikely. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 27 of 50 'I"

As the air accumulates within the space, the lung parenchyma becomes compressed, resulting in respiratory distress, reduced breath sounds, hyperresonance to percussion, and in severe cases, tension on the mediastinal structures impeding venous return resulting in hypotension. A spontaneous primary pneumothorax can occur in a tall, thin, young person because of the rupture of a pulmonary bleb, classically in a young athlete and often during physical exertion. Small pneumothoraces can be managed with serial examinations and repeat chest x-rays to confirm resolution. When the lesion is larger than 20 to 30% of the hemithoracic volume, a chest tube should be placed to evacuate the pneumothorax and reinflate the lung to prevent the development of a persistent or permanent pneumothorax. Tension pneumothorax should be immediately decompressed with emergent needle thoracostomy to prevent hemodynamic collapse.",

Narrowing of moderate-sized airways (Choice C) presents with poor air movement, wheezing or rhonchi, and cough, and describes the pathophysiology of bronchitis. Asthma classically results in narrowing of the small airways. Pleural inflammation (Choice D) presents with pleuritic chest pain, often following a viral respiratory infection. Occasionally, a friction rub may be heard on auscultation, but often the examination and vital signs are unremarkable. Pulmonary parenchymal inflammation (Choice E) describes pneumonitis or pneumonia, which typically presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and cough; hyperresonance to percussion would not be expected. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 28 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Crohn disease is characterized by transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, most frequently involving the terminal ileum. It can arise anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract and is a subclass of inflammatory bowel disease. Most patients experience chronic abdominal cramping, bloody diarrhea, anemia, and weight loss. Examination often demonstrates generalized abdominal tenderness, sometimes worse in the right lower quadrant, and, depending on the severity and extent, may disclose complications such as enterocutaneous fistulas and extraintestinal manifestations such as uveitis. Severe Crohn disease can result in intestinal obstruction from stricture or inflammation, bowel perforation, intra-abdominal abscess, and the formation of additional fistulas. Diagnosis occurs through colonoscopy with biopsy, which is the best next step in the diagnosis of this patient. Laboratory analyses often disclose increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein concentration. Treatment is through anti-inflammatory medications, immunomodulators, and glucocorticoids, with complicated, severe cases sometimes requiring surgery including small bowel resection or colectomy.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Barium enema is used to evaluate the lumen of the large bowel to assist in the diagnosis of colonic neoplasms, strictures, fistulas, or postsurgical complications. It does not reliably image the distal small bowel and does not permit sampling of tissue for biopsy. Upper gastrointestinal series with a water-soluble contrast and small bowel follow-through (Choice B) studies are indicated when structural lesions involving the stomach or small bowel are suspected. This is most commonly indicated for the evaluation of small bowel pathology, such as duodenal atresia, malrotation with volvulus, and Crohn disease; however, it would not offer the opportunity to sample tissue through biopsy. MRI of the abdomen (Choice C) offers high-contrast resolution detail of soft-tissue structures within the abdomen. It can be used for the evaluation of a variety of intra-abdominal pathologies. MRI enterography techniques can be utilized to investigate sites of active or chronic bowel inflammation, although this would not permit tissue sampling. Capsule endoscopy (Choice D) is used in the diagnosis of jejunal and proximal ileal pathology located outside of the reachable field of view of upper endoscopy or colonoscopy. It is most commonly used in the workup of small bowel sources of gastrointestinal bleeding or neoplasia. It offers images only and cannot be used for tissue sampling. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 31 of 50 'I 31 . A 66-year-old man with unresectable squamous cell lung cancer has the acute onset of severe shortness of breath. An x-ray of the chest shows a unilateral pleural effusion . The patient has been receiving hospice care at home. Which of the following management strategies is most consistent with the patient's preference for hospice care? A) Initiation of systemic chemotherapy B) Radiation therapy C) Open pleurodesis D) Thoracentesis E) Tracheostomy CorrectAnswer: D. Hospice care generally carries the goal of providing an improved quality of life for a patient when a terminal condition is present. While the criteria for hospice eligibility vary by state and sometimes by individual hospice organization, there are general universally agreed-upon conditions for eligibility such that a life-limiting condition must be present, often with a prognosis of 6 months or less to live. Additionally, frequent hospitalizations; progressive weight loss or failure to thrive; terminal malignancy; advanced dementia, Alzheimer type; end-stage kidney disease without dialysis or transplant; and end-stage heart, lung, or liver failure are often conditions for which hospice eligibility exists. In such cases, a focus is placed on the patient's goals of care related to quality of life, and procedures or medical treatments that would improve such quality are undertaken in lieu of those that would limit the quality of life or cause undue distress without changing prognosis. Thoracentesis in the setting of terminal lung cancer would improve the patient's respiratory status and comfort without adding undue risk for pain. This is an appropriate intervention for a patient with terminal lung cancer and a large, compromising pleural effusion. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Initiation of systemic chemotherapy (Choice A), radiation therapy (Choice B), open pleurodesis (Choice C), and tracheostomy (Choice E) would all add undue discomfort and suffering without altering the patient's prognosis. These are contraindicated in a hospice patient with a terminal malignancy. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 32 of 50 'I"

It may be followed during treatment to assess treatment response but does not have a specific role in diagnosis. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA scan) (Choice C) evaluates the patency of the hepatobiliary tree and gallbladder. It is useful in cases of suspected acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, or biliary obstruction with indeterminate ultrasonography findings. It does not permit tissue sampling such as biopsy or therapeutic interventions such as stenting. Liver biopsy (Choice D) is useful in the diagnosis of conditions such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, though cholangiocarcinoma is generally small and confined to the biliary tree. These features may result in false negative liver biopsy results and should prompt targeted sampling via ERCP. Exploratory laparotomy (Choice E) involves the surgical evaluation of the peritoneal cavity and is commonly employed in the diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma, bowel obstruction, peritonitis, and undifferentiated cases of an acute abdomen.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Osteoporosis occurs because of the loss of bone mineral density. The condition results from the interplay of three possible mechanisms: failure to achieve peak bone density, increased bone resorption, and decreased new bone formation. The condition is often asymptomatic until a traumatic injury results in a fracture, most commonly involving the hip, distal radius, or vertebrae. Classically, serum calcium, vitamin D, and magnesium concentrations are within the reference ranges; however, calcium handling in the bloodstream is key in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Hypocalcemia and hypovitaminosis D both lead to increased concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which results in increased osteoclast activity and bone resorption. Low concentrations of vitamin D are also associated with increased concentrations of PTH even when serum calcium is within the reference range. The diagnosis of osteoporosis is made based on DEXA scan once the bone density falls below 2.5 standard deviations of the mean for a young adult. Treatment includes correcting any modifiable risk factors, supplementing calcium and vitamin D, weight-bearing exercise therapy, and the use of osteoclast inhibitors (e.g., bisphosphonates).",

A deficiency of this enzyme would be uncommon outside of a primary kidney disease. Nutritional deficiency of vitamin D is more likely when the precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration is low. Decreased thyroxine (T concentration (Choice B) presents with symptoms of hypothyroidism including weight gain, lethargy, fatigue, constipation, hair loss, and cold intolerance. Thyroid hormone promotes bone ) 4 mineral density; however, in the absence of additional symptoms of hypothyroidism, a deficiency of thyroxine is less likely. Increased calcitonin concentration (Choice C) classically presents with hypocalcemia, as calcitonin promotes osteoblast activity with resultant bone mineral deposition.

Many people will develop some degree of valve stenosis because of chronic inflammation with resultant calcification and fibrosis over time, with the aortic valve most commonly affected. Structural abnormalities of the valve, such as a bicuspid aortic valve, alter the biomechanics of valve opening and closing, which increases the likelihood of earlier calcification and resultant stenosis because of increased mechanical trauma. Congenital bicuspid aortic valve classically presents with early signs and symptoms of aortic stenosis and left-sided diastolic heart failure. Patients may report fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, diminished exercise tolerance, or syncope with exertion. Examination findings include a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border, and pulsus parvus et tardus (weak and delayed) may be noted on examination of peripheral pulses. Because of the chronic increased afterload from a fixed obstruction by the valve, left ventricular hypertrophy and resultant diastolic dysfunction can occur.

Rupture of the chordae tendineae (Choice C) may occur following a myocardial infarction. It typically leads to acute valvular regurgitation and is classically associated with acute pulmonary edema from mitral regurgitation. Streptococcal infection (Choice D) is associated with rheumatic heart disease, which results in inflammation of the valves of the heart, most commonly the mitral and aortic valves. This may present with acute regurgitant murmurs and chronically can result in stenosis. This patient's bicuspid aortic valve is his main risk factor for early-onset aortic stenosis. Thrombus deposition on the valve (Choice E) is commonly seen in cases of mechanical valve replacement with subtherapeutic anticoagulation.

It is useful in cases of suspected acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, or biliary obstruction with indeterminate ultrasonography findings. It does not permit tissue sampling such as biopsy or therapeutic interventions such as stenting. Liver biopsy (Choice D) is useful in the diagnosis of conditions such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, though cholangiocarcinoma is generally small and confined to the biliary tree. These features may result in false negative liver biopsy results and should prompt targeted sampling via ERCP. Exploratory laparotomy (Choice E) involves the surgical evaluation of the peritoneal cavity and is commonly employed in the diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma, bowel obstruction, peritonitis, and undifferentiated cases of an acute abdomen. It does not have an immediate role in the diagnosis or management of cholangiocarcinoma. r \" , r-- r ,",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Prescription for an exercise program is the most appropriate initial step in management for this patient. Leg pain that occurs following exertion and improves with rest is known as claudication and indicates the presence of peripheral vascular disease. Claudication results from increased physiologic demand of the skeletal musculature for oxygen, which cannot be met because of the fixed obstruction to flow of stenotic arteries. As demand falls during rest, the pain typically improves. Peripheral vascular disease is common among older men who smoke cigarettes and have a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia. Active exercise improves collateral vascularization, which allows for improved arterial oxygenated blood flow to the skeletal musculature and is the best initial step in treatment along with the mitigation of risk factors. Additional therapeutic options include cilostazol and surgical revascularization (e.g., bypass, stenting), which can be employed following exercise therapy.",

The disease cause of claudication is generally not because of sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction, and sympathectomy does not generally play a role in treatment. Vasodilator therapy (Choice D) (e.g., cilostazol) may have a role in treating this patient's claudication, but it will not promote collateral vascularization which improves long-term symptoms. Because of this, initial treatment with a regimented exercise program is recommended. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 39 of 50 'I"

        "A": "Anaplastic carcinoma is a rare, aggressive thyroid malignancy that invades local structures such as the esophagus and trachea. It generally only occurs in older persons and carries a poor prognosis. On examination, a \"hard, woody mass\" may be palpable along with symptoms of dysphagia or hoarseness. Follicular carcinoma (Choice B) also presents with a thyroid nodule and is the second most common thyroid malignancy after papillary carcinoma. It is diagnosed on biopsy, as the neoplastic cells are noted to invade the surrounding capsule, which differentiates it from a benign follicular adenoma. It typically carries a good prognosis. Hurthle cell adenoma (Choice C) is a less common type of benign thyroid adenoma arising from Hurthle cells. It most commonly occurs in older females. Papillary carcinoma (Choice E) is the most common type of thyroid cancer and carries an excellent prognosis. It typically demonstrates empty-appearing nuclei with central clearing, nuclear grooves, and psammoma bodies on histology.

A) Abdominal ultrasonography B) Administration of vitamin B (cyanocobalamin) and folic acid 12 C) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography D) Hemodialysis E) Paracentesis Correct Answer: E. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) occurs most frequently in cirrhotic states, although it can occur in any setting causing ascites. SBP describes an infection within ascitic fluid in the peritoneal cavity, most often from translocated enteric flora such as Escherichia coli. The classic presentation includes fever along with diffuse abdominal pain and tenderness in a patient with ascites. If there is clinical concern for SBP, the ascites fluid should be sampled through a paracentesis. Laboratory analysis of the ascitic fluid should include Gram stain, culture, and cell counts. A total leukocyte count of greater than 1000/mm 3 or greater than 250 neutrophils/mm 3 is generally diagnostic of SBP since culture results are variably positive. Antibiotics with gram-negative rod coverage (e.g., third-generation cephalosporins) are considered first-line. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Abdominal ultrasonography (Choice A) may provide detail as to the presence of ascites and the structural character of the liver. However, in cases with clear signs of liver failure and evidence of ascites on examination, it would delay sampling of the ascites fluid and administration of antibiotics. Administration of vitamin B (cyanocobalamin) and folic acid (Choice B) is important in the repletion of deficient cofactors and coenzymes as a result of the patient's chronic malnutrition. However, such repletion 12 should follow addressing more immediate infectious concerns from SBP. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (Choice C) is a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic intervention for the evaluation of the anatomy and patency of the hepatobiliary tree. It does not have an immediate role in the management of SBP.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency are associated with chronic pancreatitis and result from repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis leading to the destruction of acinar and islet cells. The loss of acinar and islet parenchyma can be further exacerbated if a distal pancreatectomy is performed to control symptoms or manage complications of chronic pancreatitis. The exocrine pancreas produces digestive enzymes, the absence of which leads to malnutrition (e.g., cachexia, muscle wasting), weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and frequent, loose, foul-smelling, sometimes oily stools (steatorrhea). The diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency is through clinical history, imaging, and biopsy. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is treated with oral pancreatic enzyme replacement such as pancrelipase. Endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, if present, typically results in diabetes mellitus, which requires insulin replacement therapy. Any modifiable inciting causes of pancreatitis (e.g., gallstones, alcohol use disorder, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia) should be mitigated to delay disease progression and preserve remaining native pancreatic function.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Cephalocele defines a protrusion of intracranial contents through a defect in the skull, typically covered by skin and dura. They do not classically appear vascular or expand with time. Fat necrosis (Choice B) generally results from a traumatic injury involving adipose tissue and appears erythematous, nodular, and often demonstrates calcifications on imaging. Lesions do not typically persist or expand over time. Lymphatic hypertrophy (Choice C) presents with enlarged lymph nodes or lymphedema and characteristically presents without erythema, except in cases of lymphangitis or chronic dermatitis. Malignant transformation (Choice D) describes the conversion of a benign lesion to a state of malignancy with the potential for metastasis and invasion, which is rare in hemangiomas. Retention cyst (Choice E) describes a benign lesion that arises when a gland is unable to excrete its product, for example, a mucous retention cyst in the oral cavity, or a sebaceous cyst of the skin. Their growth is typically slow and generally not accompanied by symptoms apart from the presence of the lesion. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 46 of 50 'I 46 . A 62-year-old man with alcoholism comes to the emergency department because he has vomited bright red blood three times during the past 6 hours . His pulse is 130/min , and blood pressure is 90/40 mm Hg. He becomes dizzy when he sits up. Abdominal examination shows marked distention, shifting dullness , and a fluid wave . Upper endoscopy shows esophageal varices and an ulcer with a blood clot on a visible vessel located on the posterior wall of the first part of the duodenum . Which of the following is the most appropriate next step? A) Intravenous administration of ADH (vasopressin) B) Intravenous administration of esmolol C) Intravenous fluid therapy and blood transfusion D) Endoscopic-guided sclerosis of the esophageal varices E) Placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portal shunt Correct Answer: C. Tachycardia and hypotension in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding is diagnostic of decompensated hemorrhagic shock, for which the appropriate immediate treatment includes intravenous fluid therapy and blood transfusion, regardless of the underlying cause of blood loss. Alcohol use disorder promotes the formation of gastric and duodenal ulcers through mucosal irritation and gastritis. If an ulcer erodes through the mucosa and submucosa, marked bleeding can occur from the underlying vessels. Posterior duodenal ulcers are often associated with erosion into the gastroduodenal artery. If bleeding is not promptly addressed with fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion, and endoscopic or surgical control, rapid exsanguination and death can result. Treatment should also include administration of an intravenous proton pump inhibitor. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E. Intravenous administration of ADH (vasopressin) (Choice A) would not take the place of immediate fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion in a patient with blood loss, tachycardia, and hypotension. It no longer has a recognized role in the immediate management of gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. Intravenous administration of esmolol (Choice B) may worsen the hemodynamics of a patient with hemorrhagic shock and is contraindicated, as it blocks beta-adrenergic receptors resulting in decreased heart rate and myocardial contractility, which in turn decreases cardiac output. In cases of hemorrhagic shock, mean arterial pressure is maintained by systemic vascular resistance and heart rate; stroke volume is often dramatically diminished because of low preload in the setting of blood loss. Endoscopic-guided sclerosis of the esophageal varices (Choice D) is incorrect, as the patient's hemorrhagic shock is secondary to a bleeding duodenal ulcer, not esophageal varices. Any active variceal bleeding would have been noted during the upper endoscopy. Placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portal shunt (Choice E) is used in the prevention of variceal bleeding by decreasing portal venous pressure. It does not have an immediate role in the management of a bleeding duodenal ulcer. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 47 of 50 'I 47 .

A 24-hour urine collection shows increased catecholamine and metanephrine concentrations . An MRI of the abdomen shows a 4-cm enhancing mass in the right adrenal gland . Surgical excision of the mass is scheduled . Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy to prepare this patient for surgical removal of the adrenal mass? A) Atropine B) Methylprednisolone C) Phenoxybenzamine D) Propranolol E) Sodium nitroprusside Correct Answer: C. Pheochromocytoma presents with episodic headaches, sweating, palpitations, tremors, agitation, tachycardia, tachypnea, and treatment-refractory hypertension. It is the most common tumor of the adrenal medulla, and is marked by the functional secretion of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine, which causes episodic hyperadrenergic symptoms. Physical examination may disclose diaphoresis, tremor, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hyperthermia during a symptomatic episode, and may be normal otherwise. Diagnosis is through laboratory evaluation and imaging studies. Laboratory evaluation may disclose increased urine and plasma catecholamines and metanephrines. Imaging studies may disclose a tumor within the adrenal gland, though 10% are extra-adrenal. Treatment includes a-adrenergic blocker such as phenoxybenzamine, an irreversible inhibitor, followed by 13-adrenergic blocker before resection. Failure to administer appropriate antiadrenergic therapy may result in hypertensive crisis or tachydysrhythmia at the time of resection. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E.",
        "B": "Methylprednisolone is a glucocorticoid with trace mineralocorticoid activity used in the management of allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, multiple sclerosis, and many other rheumatologic, autoimmune, infectious, and neoplastic conditions. It does not have an immediate role in the direct management of pheochromocytoma.",
        "D": "Propranolol is a nonspecific 13-adrenergic blocker used in the management of panic disorder, social phobia, essential tremor, thyrotoxicosis, tachyarrhythmias, migraines, and portal venous hypertension. It previously had a role in the management of hypertension, angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction, but is no longer a first-line medication for these conditions. It has a potential role in the management of pheochromocytoma but should follow a-adrenergic blocker. Sodium nitroprusside (Choice E) is an intravenous, titratable vasodilator used in the management of hypertensive emergencies; however, it may result in reflex tachycardia in the setting of pheochromocytoma. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 48 of 50 'I 48 . A 57-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of a 1-month history of profuse , watery diarrhea with facial flushing . During this period , he has had fatigue and a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss . The diarrhea has not resolved with use of over-the-counter antidiarrheal medications . He has no history of serious illness and takes no other medications . His pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities . Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun . His stool output is 5 Lover the next 24 hours ; his stool potassium concentration is increased . Serum studies show a pH of 7.56 and a potassium concentration of 2.8 mEq/L. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a pancreatic mass . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Gastrinoma B) Glucagonoma C) lnsulinoma D) Somatostatinoma E) VIPoma Correct Answer: E. VIPoma is a rare tumor often associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia that produces vasoactive intestinal peptide {VIP). Through its physiologic mechanism of action, VIP causes chronic and profound watery diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypercalcemia), achlorhydria, alkalosis, flushing, and vasodilation. This syndrome is often termed WDHA syndrome (watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, achlorhydria). Diagnostic evaluation includes imaging of the abdomen with CT scan or MRI, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, or PET scan to assist in localization of the tumor, and biopsy for tissue evaluation. Treatment includes correction of the associated fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base derangements, along with surgery and/or chemotherapy. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Gastrinoma {Choice A) is associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, the constellation of findings stemming from a gastrin-secreting tumor. It results in excessive production of acid by the gastric parietal cells. This can lead to recurrent, chronic duodenal or jejunal ulcers, which can present with abdominal pain, diarrhea secondary to malabsorption, and possible hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. Glucagonoma {Choice B) is a rare functional malignancy that secretes glucagon, which increases serum glucose concentration. Symptoms are nonspecific and include mild diabetes mellitus, paraneoplastic rash (e.g., necrolytic migratory erythema), and weight loss. lnsulinoma {Choice C) is a rare neoplasm of pancreatic islet cells that functionally produces insulin in a dysregulated manner. Insulin is produced even in periods of hypoglycemia. Patients present with symptoms of hypoglycemia, which are generally neuroglycopenic (agitation, headache, blurry vision, diplopia, tremor), autonomic {diaphoresis, tremoring, nausea, vomiting, cramping, tachycardia, anxiety), and nonspecific (fatigue, weakness, lethargy), and are often exacerbated by periods of fasting or exercise. Somatostatinoma {Choice D) is an uncommon neuroendocrine malignancy that presents with weight loss, mild diabetes mellitus, steatorrhea caused by limited cholecystokinin release, and achlorhydria from inhibition of gastrin. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 49 of 50 'I 49 . A previously healthy 37-year-old man comes to the physician because of blurred vision for 2 weeks . His blood pressure is 130/85 mm Hg. Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes . Funduscopic examination shows slightly pale optic discs . Visual field testing shows bitemporal hemianopia . The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Basilar artery aneurysm B) Cavernous sinus thrombosis C) Craniopharyngioma D) Optic nerve glioma E) Pituitary adenoma Correct Answer: E. Pituitary adenoma is associated with bitemporal hemianopsia because of its proximity to the optic chiasm. The nasal (medial) retina receives light entering the eye from temporal (lateral) sources. The fibers from this area of the retina travel within the medial aspect of the optic nerve, and then cross at the optic chiasm to form the optic tract within the contralateral brain. Damage to these fibers anywhere along their course will prevent the patient from perceiving images projected on the retina from the temporal field of view. Classically, patients report poor peripheral vision and a resultant inability to walk or drive as they cannot see things lateral to their bodies. The optic chiasm sits directly superior to the sella turcica, and pituitary adenomas may grow superiorly, compressing the chiasm resulting in loss of a patient's bilateral temporal field of view. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Basilar artery aneurysms (Choice A), when small and unruptured, may be asymptomatic. In cases of rupture or thrombosis, the posterior intracranial circulation may be affected, and patients can present with headache, cranial nerve deficits, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, and ataxia. Cavernous sinus thrombosis (Choice B) classically follows an infection or injury involving a structure drained by the cavernous sinus (e.g., sinusitis), and results in cranial nerve deficits involving those that traverse the cavernous sinus (oculomotor, trochlear, trigeminal, and abducens nerves). Classic symptoms include ipsilateral orbit pain, proptosis, periorbital edema, and impairment in extraocular movement, pupil reactivity, or symmetry.",
        "C": "Craniopharyngioma is a tumor seen in the sella turcica derived from remnants of Rathke pouch. It is the most common supratentorial tumor in childhood, although it is much less common than pituitary adenomas in adults. When large, they can compress the optic chiasm and cause bitemporal hemianopsia. Optic nerve glioma (Choice D) typically presents with unilateral vision loss or an afferent pupillary defect. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 50 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The inhalation of orogastric contents is known as aspiration, and it can occur from simple fluids such as water or stomach contents such as emesis or regurgitated products. Small volume, simple fluid aspiration may be resorbed by the lung without any consequence of infection, irritation, or compromised gas exchange. In other cases, large volume aspiration may sufficiently impair gas exchange resulting in refractory hypoxia. The aspiration of acidic stomach contents may cause aspiration pneumonitis, whereas the aspiration of gastrointestinal flora and additional bacteria can cause aspiration pneumonia. The volume of aspirate is the strongest predictor of complications from aspiration, especially in the case of pneumonia, as the bacterial inoculum may overwhelm the native ability of the pulmonary alveolar defenses (macrophages, cilia, mucus) to prevent colonization, replication, and infection. Aspiration pneumonia classically presents with cough productive of foul-smelling sputum, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, and rhonchi on examination. Imaging classically shows an infiltrate in the most dependent segments of lung at the time of aspiration (e.g., in the superior segment of the inferior lobe when supine or lower lobes when erect), and treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics with sufficient coverage of oral flora, gram-negative rods, and anaerobes.",

Duration of endotracheal intubation (Choice B) increases the risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia, which is not characteristically caused by oral flora. Typical organisms include Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Presence of solid material in the aspirate (Choice C) increases the risk for airway obstruction and atelectasis following aspiration, and also increases the risk for pneumonia, but to a lesser extent than the overall volume of aspiration fluid. Use of prophylactic antibiotics preoperatively (Choice D) is indicated to prevent skin and soft-tissue infections, contamination from the operative incision, sepsis, and peritonitis in the case of intra-abdominal surgery. r \" , r-- r ,"

Testicular torsion occurs when the testicle twists on the spermatic cord, resulting in subsequent insufficient testicular blood supply. Patients typically present with acute, severe testicular pain, swelling, and erythema. On physical examination, the testicle typically demonstrates an abnormal lie (e.g., transverse), extreme tenderness to palpation, absent cremasteric reflex, and pain that does not improve with elevation of the scrotum (as it does in epididymitis). The diagnosis is often clinical, though in cases of uncertainty, evaluation begins with ultrasonography, which delineates testicular size, sonographic features, blood flow, and epididymal anatomy. Management requires immediate surgical exploration of the scrotum with detorsion of the spermatic cord followed by bilateral orchiopexy to prevent future testicular torsion.",

On examination, pericarditis demonstrates a diastolic friction rub, described as a harsh sound heard in diastole. The condition is diagnosed clinically and supported by increased inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. If not treated, pericarditis can lead to the development of pericardia! effusions, which, if large and quickly accumulating, can result in cardiac tamponade. An echocardiography should be performed to assess for the presence of a pericardia! effusion, which may require pericardiocentesis for drainage if large.

Physical examination may demonstrate excessive lacrimation, conjunctiva! erythema, decreased visual acuity, and increased light sensitivity. Fluorescein staining is indicated to assess for a corneal injury. Fluorescein passes over intact corneal tissue but is trapped in epithelial defects, which are easily visualized under a blacklight.

A ruptured intracerebral aneurysm is the most common cause of nontraumatic SAH, especially in a previously healthy patient. Saccular intracerebral aneurysms typically occur at bifurcations in the Circle of Willis at the base of the brain, most commonly at the site of the anterior communicating artery. Patients may present with an acute, severe headache, stupor, or coma in severe cases. On physical examination, nuchal rigidity is a common finding secondary to meningeal irritation from the blood products within the subarachnoid space. CT scan of the head typically demonstrates hyperdense blood products in the cerebral sulci and basal cisterns if performed within 6 hours of onset. As the blood products circulate within the subarachnoid space, communicating or obstructive hydrocephalus can result, which leads to increased intracranial pressure, potential herniation, coma, and death.",

A GBM would be unlikely to present with acute-onset severe headache, coma, and death in a previously healthy patient. Hemorrhage in the pons and midbrain (Choice D) is most commonly associated with hypertension. It typically presents as a decreased level of consciousness (e.g., stupor, coma, locked-in syndrome), along with quadriplegia, cranial nerve palsies, and possible Cheyne-Stokes respirations. Right epidural hemorrhage (Choice E) typically follows trauma to the anterior-lateral skull, which results in injury to the underlying middle meningeal artery.

This results in occlusion of the distal arterial vasculature with small cholesterol emboli, which induces a localized inflammatory response and end-organ damage. Dermatologic manifestations of this phenomenon are localized petechiae, livedo reticularis, and blue toe syndrome. Risk factors for cholesterol embolization syndrome include trauma and interventional procedures that increase the risk for damage and dislodgement of atherosclerotic plaques, such as cardiac catheterization (e.g., damage to atherosclerotic plaques of the thoracic and abdominal aorta via a femoral artery approach).

The most common intracranial tumor is a metastatic lesion from an extracranial primary malignancy. The cerebellum is a common location for metastases, along with the gray-white matter junction of the supratentorial brain. Cerebellar metastases typically present as a headache and symptoms of cerebellar dysfunction, such as gait disturbance, limb discoordination, and dizziness. Metastases to the brain are associated with significant vasogenic edema. This edema can lead to abnormal enlargement of the cerebellum, which can impress upon the fourth ventricle and foramina of Magendie and Luschka. This can result in the development of obstructive hydrocephalus and increased ICP. Increased ICP presents as nonspecific symptoms of altered mental status, stupor, vomiting, seizures, and blurry vison. Papilledema refers to optic disc swelling seen on funduscopic examination of the eyes and is secondary to increased intracranial pressure. The administration of intravenous corticosteroids assists in reducing metastasis-associated vasogenic edema, limiting its mass effect and risk for the development of obstructive hydrocephalus and increased ICP.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Hypercalcemic crisis secondary to malignancy-associated hypercalcemia is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Acute hypercalcemia can present as a broad spectrum of symptoms and can be life threatening because of its effect on neuronal conduction, the cardiac action potential, kidney function, and volume status. It commonly presents as constipation, lethargy, weakness, and altered mental status. It can result in a short QT interval and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, leading to significant dehydration. A potential cause of severe hypercalcemic crisis is malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, which can be secondary to the humoral secretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma of the lung) or from direct invasion and lytic lesions of the bone from osseous metastases (e.g., breast cancer). Treatment emphasizes preventing end-stage kidney disease, promoting the renal excretion of calcium, reducing intestinal absorption of calcium, inhibiting bony destruction, and, if necessary, renal replacement therapy with dialysis. Treatment therefore begins with the infusion of normal saline to restore intravascular volume and dilute serum calcium, followed by the administration of osteoclast inhibitors such as bisphosphonates, and possibly calcitonin if further medications are required to decrease calcium concentrations.",

        "A": "Adverse reaction to cytotoxic chemotherapy can result in hypocalcemia, such as in the setting of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS most commonly occurs following chemotherapy initiation for leukemia or lymphoma. The abrupt destruction of a large number of tumor cells results in interstitial and serum release of their contents, manifesting as hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and hyperuricemia. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is not typically associated with hypercalcemia. Cerebral infarction (Choice B) would result in focal neurologic deficits that vary based on the location of the infarct. This patient presents with lethargy and somnolence without focal neurologic signs. Seizure disorders (Choice D) typically present as recurrent seizures that may be simple, partial, complex, or generalized depending on the location and extent of the epileptogenic focus. The patient presents with a multiple-day history of altered mental status without features suggestive of recurrent seizures or subclinical status epilepticus. Systemic effect of radiation therapy (Choice E) would not explain the patient's symptoms as she received radiation to the lumbar spine and iliac crest.

A) Adenocarcinoma of the lung B) AsP,ergilloma C) Histoplasmosis D) Mesothelioma E) Small cell carcinoma of the lung Correct Answer: B. Aspergillomas are the most common presentation of pulmonary aspergillosis resulting from infection by the Aspergillus species, which is characterized by septated hyphae with acute angle branching. Pulmonary aspergillosis can result in many clinical presentations such as aspergilloma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic necrotizing aspergillosis, and airway invasive or angioinvasive aspergillosis. Aspergillomas (the formation of fungal masses) arise within existing cavitary lesions of the lung, such as those caused by previous infection with tuberculosis, emphysematous blebs or bullae, or from cavitary squamous cell lung carcinoma. Patients typically present with a persistent, sometimes bloody cough, with a history of a prior cavitary lung disease. Chest x-rays should be obtained, which will demonstrate a round, solid nodule or mass within a larger lung cavity. The location of the cavity and fungal mass varies based on the location of the cavitary disease, with an apical predominance following tuberculosis, and varied location in the setting of squamous cell carcinoma or emphysematous bullae. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E. Adenocarcinoma of the lung (Choice A) is the most common overall lung cancer, and the most common among nonsmokers. It typically presents as a chronic consolidation in the periphery of the lung. It does not form within or result in formation of a pulmonary cavity.",

Pulmonary histoplasmosis can present in acute, subacute, or chronic phases, generally characterized by fevers, malaise, myalgia with associated cough, and hemoptysis with development of small calcified nodules and mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.",
        "D": "Mesothelioma is a malignancy of the pleura associated with prior exposure to asbestos. It often presents as diffuse pleural thickening and exudative pleural effusions. Small cell carcinoma of the lung (Choice E) is a neuroendocrine subtype of bronchogenic carcinoma that is strongly associated with cigarette smoking.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Bedside transabdominal ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step for the diagnosis of a potentially ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). AAl\\s most commonly occur in the infrarenal abdominal aorta secondary to a relative insufficient blood supply from the vasa vasorum. This results in an increased susceptibility to aneurysmal formation. AAl\\s are associated with atherosclerosis, increased age, male sex, family history, and tobacco use. They can present as a pulsatile abdominal mass, which may be difficult to palpate in patients with obesity. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends asymptomatic screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. Findings that raise suspicion for a ruptured AAA include acute, sharp, tearing, abdominal or back pain with features of hemorrhagic shock (tachycardia, hypotension). Bedside transabdominal ultrasonography is the quickest option to evaluate the abdominal aorta and permits delineation of the AAA size. It may show evidence of rupture or dissection as well. Definitive management includes endovascular or open surgical repair of the abdominal aorta.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast is not indicated in situations concerning for AAA rupture when hemorrhagic shock is present. Obtaining the CT scan would require an inappropriate amount of time, which would delay definitive diagnosis and management and risk further hemodynamic decompensation. HIDA scan (Choice C) evaluates the hepatobiliary tree and gallbladder and is useful to evaluate cases of suspected cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis with indeterminate ultrasonography findings. Acute cholecystitis classically presents as colicky and then continuous right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Intravenous pyelography (Choice D) involves the intravenous injection of radio-opaque contrast to visualize the renal collecting system, ureters, and bladder under fluoroscopy. This allows for the investigation of suspected urinary tract anatomic abnormalities, malignancies, and strictures. Peritoneal lavage (Choice E) involves aspiration of peritoneal contents, infusing sterile saline into the peritoneal cavity, and analyzing the effluent. If blood, food particles, bile, bilirubin, amylase, or alkaline phosphatase are found, exploratory laparotomy is indicated as the presence of these findings suggests hollow or solid viscus injury. Digital subtraction arteriography (Choice F) is a fluoroscopic technique used for visualization of blood vessels during catheter angiography. This technique is used for a variety of endovascular techniques, including arterial stenting, angioplasty, embolization, thrombectomy, and endovascular aneurysm repair. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 13 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Discontinuation of heparin is the first step in management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT typically occurs between 5 and 10 days after the initiation of heparin therapy. HIT results from the development of lgG antibodies against the complex of heparin and platelet factor 4. The antibody-heparin-platelet complex leads to the activation of platelets, which can cause thrombosis and consumption of platelets. This abnormal activation and consumption results in progressively decreasing platelet counts, which typically nadir at >50% of their initial level. Treatment requires cessation of all heparin-related products (e.g., unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin). The patient should be transitioned to a direct thrombin inhibitor or direct factor Xa inhibitor to ensure adequate anticoagulation without worsening the thrombocytopenia. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, E, and F. Measurement of antithrombin 111 concentration (Choice A) is indicated in the evaluation of hypercoagulability. Deficiency of antithrombin 111 is a cause of hypercoagulability that can be hereditary or acquired as a result of nephrotic syndrome. It would not cause acute changes in platelet count. Serum D-dimer assay (Choice B) is recommended for evaluation of patients with low pretest probability of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolus. If the D-dimer is increased, the next appropriate step would be Doppler ultrasonography evaluation of the lower extremity veins for a DVT or CT chest angiography for evaluation of a pulmonary embolism. Platelet transfusion (Choice D) is contraindicated in patients with HIT, as the causative antibody complex results in activation of platelets, which leads to further consumption and thrombosis. Thrombolysis (Choice E) is indicated for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, massive pulmonary embolism, or acute myocardial infarction without prompt access to percutaneous coronary intervention. Warfarin therapy (Choice F) would not be appropriate in the early stages of HIT as it can result in worsening of thrombosis because of transient hypercoagulability from initial decreased concentrations of proteins C and S, and can increase the risk for gangrene of the extremities and skin necrosis. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 14 of 50 'I",

The main adverse effects of diphenhydramine are a result of its central nervous system H rreceptor blockade, anticholinergic, and anti-a-adrenergic effects. These lead to a constellation of symptoms such as dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, hallucinations, delirium, ataxia, flushed skin, visual disturbances (cycloplegia), and sedation. Muscarinic type 3 receptors stimulate the contraction of smooth muscle in the urinary bladder wall. The anticholinergic adverse effects of diphenhydramine antagonize this action, resulting in impaired urinary bladder contractility, which subsequently leads to urinary retention. In addition to catheterization to prevent damage to the bladder and kidneys, treatment requires cessation of the offending agent and substitution with a second-generation H rreceptor blocking agent such as loratadine, which does not produce anticholinergic adverse effects.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test is necessary for the evaluation of a suspected hemolytic transfusion reaction. Transfusion reactions can range from mild (e.g., itching, fever, mild rash) to severe (e.g., hemolysis, anaphylaxis). Most reactions are mild and may not necessitate the cessation of the transfusion. An acute febrile transfusion reaction (febrile, non hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR)) occurs because of the presence of preformed antibodies to donor leukocyte antigens and occasionally from cytokines in the plasma component of the transfused sample. FNHTR ranges from mild (mild fever, minimal additional symptoms) to severe (high fevers, rigors, myalgias, nausea). Treatment consists of pausing the transfusion to rule out ABO incompatibility through performing a direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test. The Coombs test entails testing for the presence of antibodies on the recipient's red blood cells (ABO incompatibility), and if positive, would confirm an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR) instead of an FNHTR. Distinguishing the two is important as AHTR can be life threatening, leading to massive hemolysis, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.",

The Duffy antigen is a glycoprotein that can be expressed on the surface of RBCs. Antibodies to the Duffy antigen can cause hemolytic transfusion reactions, although this is less common than ABO incompatibility. Measurement of serum bilirubin concentration (Choice C) would be appropriate for the investigation of various hyperbilirubinemia states, such as liver disease, biliary disease, or hemolysis. When assessing for an AHTR, while bilirubin may be increased, ABO incompatibility should be investigated first. Measurement of urine hemoglobin concentration (Choice D) can be used in the evaluation of causes for hemoglobinuria, such as hemolysis, glomerulonephritis, or hemolytic uremic syndrome. Determining whether an AHTR is occurring via antiglobulin (Coombs) testing takes priority over urinalysis. Measurement of urine myoglobin concentration (Choice E) is used for the evaluation of rhabdomyolysis, which results in myocyte necrosis and release of myoglobin.

Because of their location below the dentate line with somatic nervous system innervation, they result in significant pain during defecation and are associated with bright red blood on toilet paper. A common initiating factor for the development of an anal fissure is a history of chronic constipation resulting in the passage of hard stool, which can cause trauma to the anal mucosa. While some anal fissures self-resolve, persistent anal fissures can result in anal spasms and increased sphincter tone on examination. Initial management for persistent, symptomatic anal fissures includes administration of stool softeners, Sitz bath, topical analgesics, and topical vasodilators.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Fat embolism is typically associated with long bone fractures resulting in fat macroglobule embolization to the pulmonary and systemic circulation. Less common causes of fat embolism include liposuction, bone marrow biopsy/transplant, and massive soft tissue injuries or burns. Patients are often asymptomatic, but if severe, fat embolism can present with the classic triad of hypoxemia, petechial rash, and neurologic derangements. Pulmonary dysfunction varies depending on the severity of emboli, presenting as tachypnea, tachycardia, dyspnea, and hypoxemia. Cerebral manifestations may include altered mental status, visual disturbances, cranial nerve deficits, stupor, seizures, or coma. Skin manifestations typically include a non palpable petechial rash involving the conjunctivae, neck, axilla, and chest. If the degree and distribution of emboli are severe, there is the potential for multiorgan dysfunction. Diagnostic imaging of the lungs may show bilateral patchy consolidations, which can often resemble acute respiratory distress syndrome. Treatment is supportive, involving maintenance of adequate oxygenation and intravascular volume.",

Patients at higher risk for aspiration include those with impaired airway-protective cough mechanisms, frequent or forceful emesis, or abnormal pharyngeal or airway anatomy. Delirium tremens (Choice B) is a withdrawal syndrome from alcohol that typically presents 2 to 4 days following cessation of alcohol intake. It typically presents as autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension), tremors, anxiety, hallucinations, confusion, delirium, ataxia, and may include convulsions, coma, and death. Myocardial infarction (Choice D) classically presents as acute-onset chest pain, often radiating to the neck, jaw, or arm, along with shortness of breath, nausea, and/or light-headedness. Pulmonary embolism (Choice E) presents as chest pain and shortness of breath, often in the setting of immobilization and known deep venous thrombosis. Vital signs may show tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia, and, if sufficiently large, hypotension. Venous thromboembolism does not present with petechiae. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 19 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Decreased renal blood flow resulting in prerenal azotemia is the most likely cause of the patient's postsurgical oliguria. Normal urine output ranges between 0.5 and 2 cc/kg/hr. Prerenal azotemia refers to an acute kidney injury secondary to insufficient renal blood flow in states of hypoperfusion, which results in a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This can occur in the setting of hypovolemia and hypotension, including transient intraoperative hypotension. In response to the decreased renal blood flow, renin and angiotensin are upregulated, which stimulates increased absorption of sodium in the proximal convoluted tubule. The decreased GFR results in decreased tubular flow rate, which consequently leads to increased urea nitrogen reabsorption and reduced urine volume because of the increased resorption of solute and water. Treatment of prerenal azotemia requires treatment of the underlying cause of reduced renal blood flow, often requiring the administration of resuscitative intravenous fluids. If untreated, this can progress to worsening acute kidney injury and possible intrinsic end-stage kidney disease.",

        "A": "induced tubular injury and tubular hemoglobin deposition (Choice D) can result in the development of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), an intrinsic form of acute kidney injury. ATN typically occurs following an ischemic or nephrotoxic insult (e.g., anesthetics, hemoglobinuria) to the kidneys, which results in necrosis of the tubular epithelium. Granular, muddy-brown casts are usually present on urinalysis. This patient developed postsurgical oliguria following a transient episode of hypotension, likely resulting in decreased, insufficient renal blood flow. Obstruction of bladder drainage (Choice C) and ureteral obstruction (Choice E), if involving bilateral ureters, can result in postrenal azotemia from impaired urinary drainage. This typically presents as anuria because of the obstruction of urinary flow.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Administration of hydrocortisone, 100 mg intravenously, is indicated for the management of acute adrenal insufficiency. The chronic use of exogenous corticosteroids results in decreased production of adrenocorticotropic hormone from the pituitary gland. This leads to atrophy of bilateral adrenal glands, and resultant diminished native production of corticosteroids. In the event of a physiologic stressor (e.g., surgery, trauma, infection), the body's physiologic demand for corticosteroids increases but is not met because of the patient's chronic adrenal atrophy. This results in the onset of acute relative adrenal insufficiency, which presents as hypoglycemia, altered mental status, hyponatremia, tachycardia, and abnormal vasodilation, including fluid- and pressor-refractory hypotension. While difficult to diagnose because of its nonspecific presentation, acute adrenal crisis should be considered in the differential of any patient presenting with circulatory collapse. Treatment requires the administration of intravenous corticosteroids to improve systemic vascular resistance and restore hemodynamic stability.",

This is no longer necessary for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism given advances in ventilation perfusion scans and CT pulmonary angiography but may still be performed if pulmonary embolectomy is required. This patient's shock is secondary to an acute adrenal crisis, not a massive pulmonary embolism. Reexploration of the abdomen (Choice E) would be indicated if there is concern for postoperative complications such as hemoperitoneum or peritonitis.

A) Hyperlipoproteinemia B) Metastatic breast cancer C) Parathyroid adenom D) Renal tubular acidosis E) Sarcoidosis Correct Answer: C. Parathyroid adenoma is the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism commonly presents as hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, osseous pain, constipation, and potential urinary tract calculi. As well, the increased serum calcium concentration is a risk factor for acute pancreatitis. Excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) results in increased serum calcium from increased osteoclast activity, intestinal absorption, and renal tubular absorption with concomitant increased excretion of phosphorus by the renal tubules. Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a parathyroid adenoma, followed by parathyroid hyperplasia and parathyroid carcinoma. Diagnosis typically requires evaluation with a technetium 99m scan, and treatment involves resection of the parathyroid adenoma. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E.",
        "A": "Hyperlipoproteinemia is an autosomal dominant disease that presents as hypertriglyceridemia contained within very-low-density lipoproteins. Hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor for acute pancreatitis, although it would not be associated with hypercalcemia. Metastatic breast cancer (Choice B) can result in hypercalcemia secondary to metastatic osteolytic lesions causing resorption of bone. Typically, phosphorus concentrations are normal or slightly increased , not low as in primary hyperparathyroidism. Renal tubular acidosis (Choice D) is a disorder of the renal tubules that results in the development of a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis.

      "presentation": "21. The atrial septal defect\nresults in a left-to-right shunt with abnormal flow of blood from the left atrium to the right atrium, resulting in relative volume overload of the right atrium and ventricle. This increased stroke volume of the right\nventricle results in delayed closure of the pulmonic valve, which presents as a fixed, split S and a low-grade physiologic ejection murmur on cardiac auscultation. The increased right heart volumes also result in a\n2\nprominent right ventricular impulse on physical examination, and may present an increased risk for the development of a right bundle branch block. Chest x-ray characteristically demonstrate increased caliber of the\nmain pulmonary artery and increased pulmonary vascular markings. If the atrial septal defect remains uncorrected, it can result in the development of Eisenmenger syndrome secondary to prolonged pulmonary\nvasculature remodeling, resulting in pulmonary arterial hypertension and shunt reversal leading to cyanosis.\nIncorrect Answers: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I.\nAortic stenosis (Choice A) presents as a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur, heard best at the upper right sternal border and radiating to the carotid arteries. It classically occurs secondary to age-related\nfibrotic and calcific changes of the valve, but it can occur earlier in life in cases of bicuspid aortic valve or rheumatic heart disease.\nCoarctation of the aorta (Choice C) refers to a narrowing of the thoracic aorta. It is associated with a bicuspid aortic valve and Turner syndrome. It typically presents as a systolic murmur with differential pulses and\nblood pressures between extremities.\nPatent ductus arteriosus (Choice D) results in a continuous, machine-like murmur heard best in the left second intercostal space, radiating to the clavicle.\nPulmonic stenosis (Choice E) presents as a systolic murmur, generally crescendo-decrescendo, heard best in the second left intercostal region, though quieter and with less radiation to the lower neck because of\nlower pressure in the pulmonary circulation.\nTetralogy of Fallo! (Choice F) consists of pulmonary infundibular stenosis, overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect, and right ventricular hypertrophy, resulting in a right-to-left shunt with cyanosis first noted in\ninfancy. The murmur heard with Tetralogy of Fallo! relates to the underlying ventricular septal defect characterized by a holosystolic murmur heard best in the left lower sternal border.\nTransposition of the great arteries (Choice G) results in aberrant reversal of the normal anatomical association of the aorta and pulmonary artery to the cardiac chambers secondary to failure of the aorticopulmonary\nseptum to spiral. This results in separate systemic and pulmonary circulations, with the aorta leaving the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk leaving the left ventricle. This is incompatible with life unless an\nadditional shunt allowing admixture of blood is present (e.g., patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect).\nTruncus arteriosus (Choice H) results from failure of the aorticopulmonary septum to divide the aorta and pulmonary trunk. Most patients present with a concomitant ventricular septal defect.\nVentricular septal defect (Choice I) refers to a defect in the interventricular septum, most commonly the membranous portion.

Fibrocystic disease is characterized by the presence of cysts, stromal fibrosis, and apocrine metaplasia on histology. On examination, the cysts may appear \"blue-domed.\" This is a benign disease process of the breast and does not convey an increased risk for breast cancer; however, it can result in recurrent breast pain and discomfort. If there is significant pain or discomfort associated with the cysts, aspiration can be performed to attempt to relieve the symptoms. Cyst aspiration can yield fluid that is clear, milky, yellow, green, or brown, which are all benign, typical findings in fibrocystic disease.",

        "B": "Fibroadenoma is one of the most common benign breast masses in patients younger than age 35 years. It typically presents as a well-circumscribed, solid, mobile mass that demonstrates an increase in size in relation to the menstrual cycle or during pregnancy secondary to increased estrogen levels.

A 27-year-old man undergoes Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity . He has type 2 diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and sleep apnea . Twelve hours after the operation , he is awake and alert . He is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 139 kg (305 lb); BMI is 45 kg/m 2 His temperature is 38.1° C (100 .6°F), pulse is 90/min , respirations are 10/min , and blood pressure is 145/85 mm Hg. Breath sounds are heard bilaterally with decreased air • movement. Arterial blood gas analysis on 4 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula shows : 7.31 55 mm Hg 64 mm Hg 26 mEq/L Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) AEJ.Qlication of continuous ositive airway pressure B) Switching from nasal cannula to face mask C) Bronchodilator therapy D) Naloxone therapy E) Reintubation Correct Answer: A. Application of continuous positive airway pressure is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's hypoxemia, hypoventilation, and respiratory acidosis, which are likely multifactorial on the basis of postoperative pain, sleep apnea, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. In the postoperative state, patients are at increased risk for poor ventilation and resultant atelectasis. This risk is further pronounced in patients with morbid obesity, decreased mobility, sleep apnea, and underlying lung or heart disease. The patient presents with decreased air movement on lung auscultation, bradypnea, and an arterial blood gas demonstrating hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acute respiratory acidosis. To improve this patient's ventilation and oxygenation, postoperative pain should be controlled to reduce ventilation-associated discomfort, and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), should be used to promote oxygenation through resolution of atelectasis and ventilation through maintained patency of the airway. If the patient remains hypercapnic in spite of pain control and CPAP, bi level positive airway pressure (Bi PAP) should be attempted next, which will promote increased minute ventilation by assisting inhalational effort. CPAP may stent the airways open, but if this is not sufficient to promote ventilation, escalation to BiPAP or invasive positive pressure ventilation may be required. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Switching from nasal cannula to face mask (Choice B) would allow for a higher oxygen delivery to the patient, but this may not improve the patient's ventilation as it would not promote airway stenting via continuous positive airway pressure during inhalation and exhalation. Bronchodilator therapy (Choice C) is classically used in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. While this assists in reducing airway obstruction through bronchodilation, this patient's ventilatory derangement stems from postoperative pain, sleep apnea, postoperative atelectasis, and probable obesity hypoventilation syndrome, which is more appropriately managed with positive airway pressure. Naloxone therapy (Choice D) is used for the reversal of opiate overdose or excessive sedation. This patient is awake and alert, making an opiate overdose unlikely.",
        "E": "Reintubation would be an appropriate step in management if noninvasive positive pressure ventilation does not improve the patient's respiratory acidosis, hypoxia, and hypoventilation.

A 92-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 6 hours after the sudden onset of abdominal pain, distention , and vomiting . She has not passed flatus during this period . She underwent appendectomy 46 years ago . Abdominal examination shows distention and diffuse tenderness . Bowel sounds are increased . An x-ray of the abdomen is shown. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings? A) Adhesions B) Appendiceal phlegmon C) Gallstone ileus D) lntussusception E) Primary tumor of the small intestine Correct Answer: A. Adhesions are the most common cause of small-bowel obstruction (SBO) in a patient with a history of prior intra-abdominal surgery. Obstruction of the small bowel occurs from partial or complete blockage of the small bowel lumen and typically presents as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and abdominal distention. Partial SBOs will allow a degree of continued flatus with diminished stooling, and complete obstruction will result in obstipation. SBO has many potential causes, although the most common are post-surgical peritoneal adhesions and hernias. On physical examination, SBO typically presents as diffuse abdominal tenderness, distention, tympany to percussion, and borborygmi (high pitched, hyperactive bowel sounds). Potential complications of SBO include bowel rupture or necrosis, which can result in abrupt peritonitic abdominal signs, such as rebound tenderness and guarding. Abdominal x-rays, if obtained in the erect position, typically demonstrate multiple air-fluid levels in the setting of dilated small bowel loops. Management requires bowel rest, intravenous hydration, and surgical intervention. If the patient has a partial obstruction, the patient should be monitored and provided supportive care. If the patient demonstrates features concerning for a persistent partial or complete obstruction, an exploratory laparotomy should be performed to alleviate the cause of the obstruction. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Appendiceal phlegmon (Choice B) is a potential complication of acute appendicitis, particularly in the setting of perforated appendicitis. It refers to an inflammatory mass-like collection consisting of the inflamed appendix, adjacent involved viscera, and peritoneum. Treatment typically requires appendectomy. Gallstone ileus (Choice C) is a cause of mechanical SBO secondary to lodging of a gallstone at the ileocecal valve. This is a potential complication of recurrent acute or chronic cholecystitis resulting in the formation of a cholecystoduodenal fistula, which can allow for the passage of gallstones into the gastrointestinal tract lumen. lntussusception (Choice D) describes telescoping of one segment of bowel into another, which can cause intestinal ischemia or obstruction. It is typically caused by a pathologic lead point (e.g., malignancy, stricture, lymphadenopathy), and presents as colicky pain and bloating. Primary tumors of the small intestine (Choice E) are rare. The most common malignant small-bowel tumors are carcinoid, lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma, and adenocarcinoma. If large enough, tumors can result in partial or complete SBO, although postsurgical adhesions are much more likely in this patient. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 46 of 50 'I 46 . A 49-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus remains hospitalized 2 days after admission for management of gangrene of the second toe of the left foot. He also has peripheral neuropathy , retinopathy , and stage Ill chronic kidney disease . His preadmission medications are insulin , valsartan , ramipril , gabapentin , and omeprazole . On admission , intravenous piperacillin -tazobactam was added to the regimen . He is following a consistent carbohydrate diet. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F) , pulse is 72/min and regular , and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Examination shows dry gangrene over the distal phalanx of the left second toe with minimal residual erythema . Pedal pulses are not palpable . Ankle systolic pressures are greater than 220 mm Hg bilaterally . Laboratory studies show : Hemoglobin A 8% c 1 Leukocyte count 8700/mm 3 with a normal differential Serum Glucose 160 mg/dL Creatinine 1.8 mg/dL On duplex ultrasonography of the left lower extremity , the femoral and popliteal arteries appear normal ; there is occlusion of all three tibial arteries in the proximal calf and reconstitution of the posterior tibial artery just proximal to the ankle . In addition to continued piperacillin-tazobactam therapy and foot care, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Below-the-knee amputation B Femorotibial bYJ)ass grafting C) High-dose clopidogrel therapy D) Percutaneous tibial angioplasty E) Supervised exercise program Correct Answer: B. Femorotibial bypass grafting is a potential treatment for severe peripheral arterial disease of the lower extremity. Peripheral arterial disease refers to the abnormally diminished flow of blood to the extremities secondary to atherosclerotic plaque. This most commonly affects the lower extremities. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, increased age, cigarette smoking, and dyslipidemia. Patients typically present with initial intermittent claudication, which results from insufficient blood flow to the muscles during exercise. As the flow of blood becomes progressively diminished with worsening atherosclerosis, it can present as pain at rest and the potential for ischemia and necrosis (gangrene) of the extremity. On examination, there are typically diminished or absent pulses in the distribution of the affected arteries. If there is critical ischemia of the extremity, gangrene may also ensue. Duplex ultrasonography or arteriography (catheter-based, CT scan, or MRI) of the lower extremities can be performed to evaluate the location and length of atherosclerotic disease and its impact on vessel luminal diameter and blood flow. Treatment includes instituting an exercise program, cilostazol, aspirin, and, if severe, angioplasty, stenting, or surgical arterial bypass. Amputation may be necessary if the degree of gangrene is significant. The patient presents with intact femoral and popliteal arteries but occluded calf arteries, although the distal posterior tibial artery demonstrates reconstitution. A femorotibial bypass graft placement would restore blood flow to the distal lower extremity. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Below-the-knee amputation (Choice A) is not indicated at this time, as the patient demonstrates gangrene of only his left second distal phalanx. Amputation is only indicated in the setting of severe gangrene of the lower extremity or if it is complicated by superinfection or necrotizing fasciitis. High-dose clopidogrel therapy (Choice C) is an antiplatelet medication that can be used in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease, although this patient is presenting with severe occlusion of his distal lower extremity, which requires surgical management at this point. Percutaneous tibial angioplasty (Choice D) is a potential intervention to improve lower extremity blood flow through catheter-based angioplasty and/or stenting. Because of the degree of occlusion in the calf blood vessels, tibial angioplasty may be impossible or impractical. Bypass grafting would provide an easier conduit for restoration of blood flow. Supervised exercise program (Choice E) is a recommended first-line therapy for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease as it stimulates the development of collateral circulation. This patient requires more urgent management involving bypass grafting. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 47 of 50 'I 47 . A 72-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of hematochezia for 12 hours . He has mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and osteoarthritis . He sustained a myocardial infarction 4 months ago . Medications include propranolol and nitroglycerin . His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4 °F), pulse is 102/min , and blood pressure is 144/82 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities . Rectal examination shows dark blood and clots . His hematocrit is 32% . The bleeding resolves spontaneously 6 hours after admission . Colonoscopy shows a short segment of sigmoid colon with edema, ulceration , and friability; no other abnormalities are noted . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Clostridium difficile colitis B) Cytomegalovirus colitis C) Diverticulitis D) lschemic colitis E) Ulcerative colitis CorrectAnswer: D. lschemic colitis refers to inadequate blood supply to the colon, which can lead to bowel wall necrosis, loss of immune barriers, and bowel perforation. lschemic colitis most commonly occurs in the setting of atherosclerosis resulting in plaque rupture within a mesenteric vessel, systemic hypotension (e.g., shock), or emboli such as in atrial fibrillation. Diminished blood flow within a vascular territory results if a specific mesenteric artery is occluded or narrowed. In the case of systemic hypotension, blood flow will be reduced within a watershed region. Patients typically present with acute abdominal pain and cramping associated with bloody bowel movements if bowel necrosis has occurred. Imaging may demonstrate thickening of the bowel wall along with pneumatosis intestinalis and possible portal venous gas or pneumoperitoneum. Diagnosis of ischemic colitis requires angiographic evaluation to assess the patency of the mesenteric arteries. Treatment of occlusive lesions includes anticoagulation, thrombectomy, angioplasty, and/or stenting. Hypoperfusion states require treatment with fluids, blood products, or vasopressors. In cases of necrosis or perforation, a bowel resection or partial colectomy may be required. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Clostridium difficile colitis (Choice A) is an opportunistic infection that commonly occurs after the use of antibiotics because of loss of native colonic microbiota. It typically presents as abdominal pain and severe watery or bloody diarrhea, and it may result in complications such as fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon. Cytomegalovirus colitis (Choice B) is an opportunistic infection commonly occurring in immunocompromised patients in the setting of solid-organ or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, severe ulcerative colitis, or AIDS. It presents as abdominal pain, fever, weight loss, and watery or bloody diarrhea.",
        "C": "Echocardiography does not have a defined role in the evaluation of a pneumothorax, as it solely evaluates the heart and pericardium. Bedside ultrasonography can be used to evaluate for the presence of a pneumothorax, although tension pneumothorax is typically a clinical diagnosis requiring emergent intervention. Radionuclide lung scan (Choice E), also known as a ventilation-perfusion scan, utilizes the administration of radionuclide compounds to evaluate the ventilation and perfusion of the lungs. This allows for the evaluation of acute pulmonary emboli when a CT scan may be contraindicated. Pulmonary angiography (Choice G) constitutes invasive catheter angiographic evaluation of the pulmonary arteries. This is no longer necessary for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism given advances in ventilation perfusion scans and CT pulmonary angiography, but it may still be performed if pulmonary embolectomy is required. Pulmonary artery catheterization (Choice H) allows for the measurement of right-sided heart, pulmonary arterial, and capillary wedge pressures, which are useful in the evaluation and management of shock (especially cardiogenic), right-sided heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 49 of 50 'I 49 . A 62-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of pain in his calves and thighs after he walks more than two blocks . The pain is relieved after he rests for 5 to 10 minutes . He has smoked one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years . His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F) , pulse is 75/min , respirations are 16/min , and blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg. Examination shows decreased femoral , popliteal , and pedal pulses bilaterally . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Aortoiliac occlusive disease (Leriche syndrome } B) Bilateral iliac aneurysms C) Bilateral superficial femoral artery occlusions D) Coarctation of the aorta E) Internal iliac artery stenosis Correct Answer: A. Aortoiliac occlusive disease (Leriche syndrome) is a type of peripheral arterial disease resulting from partial or complete occlusion of the infrarenal abdominal aorta and/or bilateral common iliac arteries. This presents as intermittent claudication of the bilateral lower extremities, with a characteristic triad of bilateral thigh and buttock claudication, absent/reduced femoral pulses, and impotence. The most common location for occlusive disease is at the aortic bifurcation, although occlusion can be multifocal and in various distributions. It is associated with large-vessel vasculitis (e.g., Takayasu arteritis), atherosclerosis, increased age, male sex, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Diagnosis occurs through a combination of physical examination findings, ankle brachia! index measurement, and CT or MR angiography. Treatment requires revascularization with angioplasty, stent placement, or vascular bypass. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Bilateral iliac artery aneurysms (Choice B) occur secondary to weakness of the arterial wall, resulting in bulging and aneurysmal dilation of the artery. They are commonly associated with atherosclerosis, with similar risk factors to abdominal aortic aneurysms. Aneurysms would not likely result in bilateral claudication symptoms unless concomitant arterial thrombosis or occlusive atherosclerotic disease was present. Bilateral superficial femoral artery occlusions (Choice C) can occur in the setting of severe atherosclerotic disease, although it would not result in loss of bilateral common femoral pulses. A central lesion resulting in occlusion of the distal aorta and bilateral iliac arteries is a more likely explanation for the patient's presentation and exam findings. Coarctation of the aorta (Choice D) is a cause of secondary hypertension related to narrowing of the thoracic aorta. It most commonly presents in childhood with differential blood pressure between upper and lower extremities, and it can result in bilateral lower extremity claudication. It is associated with bicuspid aortic valve and Turner syndrome. Internal iliac artery stenosis (Choice E) can result in claudication symptoms of the buttocks via the superior and inferior gluteal arterial branches. It would not likely result in thigh or calf claudication. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 50 of 50 'I"

These reactions result in vascular atherosclerosis and smooth muscle proliferation with subsequent parenchymal fibrosis and atrophy of the transplanted organ. Clinically, this manifests as chronic, progressive transplant dysfunction. In the kidneys, this is referred to as chronic graft nephropathy. Examples of chronic transplant rejection also include vanishing bile duct syndrome of the liver, bronchiolitis obliterans of the lung, and significant, rapid atherosclerosis of the heart. lmmunosuppressive medical therapy does not adequately prevent chronic rejection. It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality secondary to organ failure. It may require re-initiation of renal replacement therapy (e.g., hemodialysis), or another organ transplant.",

A patient with a history of malignancy, surgery, and immobility is at a substantially increased risk for the development of a DVT.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal artery is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis in younger and middle-aged women. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a noninflammatory and nonatherosclerotic angiopathy of medium-sized arteries (e.g., renal, carotid) that results in multifocal fibrous and muscular thickening of the arterial wall, which can lead to a bead-like appearance and resultant stenosis. Renal artery stenosis is a cause of secondary hypertension because of abnormal stimulation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus from low afferent blood flow leading to excessive production of renin and angiotensin. The reduced afferent blood flow can result in progressive renal atrophy. Secondary hypertension should be considered in new-onset or treatment-resistant hypertension, or in younger, otherwise healthy patients. There are two main causes of renal artery stenosis: fibromuscular dysplasia and atherosclerosis. In younger patients, fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause, while older patients develop renal artery stenosis more commonly from atherosclerosis. Diagnosis is established with renal artery Doppler ultrasonography or magnetic resonance angiography, which are able to quantify the degree of renal artery stenosis and renal atrophy. Treatment involves angioplasty or stenting of the stenosed renal artery to improve flow. ACE inhibitors can also be considered for unilateral stenosis but can lead to acute renal failure in the setting of significant bilateral renal artery stenosis.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Congenital renal artery disease can occur in pediatric patients, with or without an associated underlying congenital renal parenchymal disease. The patient presents in her fourth decade of life with new onset symptoms secondary to severe hypertension, making congenital renal artery disease since birth less likely. Premature atherosclerosis (Choice C) can result in the development of renal artery stenosis. While atherosclerosis is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis in older patients, if the patient has a predisposition to premature atherosclerosis, renal artery stenosis can ensue. The patient was previously healthy, and even though she presents with a significant smoking history, atherosclerotic stenosis is less likely. Undiagnosed previous renal trauma (Choice D) would be unlikely to cause renal artery stenosis. Renal trauma can result in kidney lacerations, contusions, or hematomas. While devascularization of the kidney pedicle can occur in high-energy blunt or penetrating trauma, this would result in renal atrophy, not insidious secondary renovascular hypertension. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 27 of 50 'I"

Subclavian steal syndrome occurs secondary to stenosis of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery. Movement and exertion of the affected upper extremity results in a reversal of flow from the ipsilateral vertebral artery into the subclavian artery to supply the upper extremity. This results in vertebrobasilar insufficiency, which can manifest as dizziness, vertigo, imbalance, light-headedness, and hearing disturbances. Most patients demonstrate differential blood pressures between the affected and unaffected upper extremities, with a greater than 15-mm Hg differential between the two. Physical examination may also demonstrate a subclavian bruit on auscultation and a reduction and/or delay in the ipsilateral radial pulse.",

This assesses for disturbances in the radial pulse secondary to thoracic outlet syndrome from an underlying anatomical abnormality (e.g., cervical rib, pectoralis minor syndrome). Neck auscultation (Choice D) is useful in the evaluation of a carotid bruit, which may indicate underlying carotid atherosclerosis, or to assess for radiation of a systolic ejection murmur (e.g., aortic stenosis). Percussion of the left ulnar nerve (Choice E) assesses for impingement or injury of the ulnar nerve such as in Guyon canal syndrome or cubital tunnel syndrome.

Necrotizing fasciitis refers to infection spreading along a deep fascial plane, most commonly from mixed flora (anaerobic and aerobic bacteria), although it can occur secondary to a single organism. It typically presents as acute onset of pain out of proportion to examination findings, erythema, and paresthesia which progresses to anesthesia at a site of prior trauma or surgery. Risk factors include the severity of inoculation and underlying chronic systemic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, liver failure, or kidney failure. As the bacterial infection spreads along the deep fascial planes, bullae with or without crepitus may develop. The extent of infection is often difficult to assess by examination alone.

Symptoms include chronic abdominal pain, weight loss, bloody diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and tenesmus. Imaging typically demonstrates loss of haustral markings. Diagnosis of ulcerative colitis is by colonoscopy and biopsy, which demonstrates characteristic crypt abscesses. Potential complications of ulcerative colitis are fulminant colitis, toxic megacolon, and perforation. As well, because of the chronic inflammation of the colon, patients are at a substantially increased risk for developing colorectal carcinoma. Screening colonoscopy is indicated every 1 to 2 years starting 8 to 10 years after diagnosis.

Acute, sharp abdominal pain, rigidity, rebound tenderness, and guarding are potential signs of peritonitis (\"peritoneal signs\") and raise suspicion for a perforated hollow viscus. The most common causes of a perforated hollow viscus are complicated peptic ulcer disease, appendicitis, or diverticulitis. Given the patient's location of epigastric and right upper quadrant pain, a perforated duodenal ulcer is the most likely cause. Peptic ulcer disease describes the presence of ulcers in the stomach or duodenum, which classically present with worsening abdominal pain related to the consumption (gastric) or lack of consumption (duodenal) of food. Peptic ulcer disease is strongly associated with infection with the bacterium He/icobacter pylori. Persistent inflammation related to a peptic ulcer can result in complications, including fibrosis, stricture, hemorrhage, and perforation. X-rays, preferably obtained in an erect or left lateral decubitus position, may demonstrate evidence of pneumoperitoneum. Emergent surgical laparotomy is required for repair of the underlying perforated duodenal ulcer and to lavage the peritoneum to reduce the risk for sepsis.

Diverticulitis presents as acute left lower quadrant abdominal pain, sometimes accompanied by diarrhea, fever, and tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant. Acute pancreatitis (Choice D) presents as epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis, often in a patient with a history of gallstones, alcohol use disorder, trauma, hypertriglyceridemia, or hypercalcemia. It can be complicated by necrosis, hemorrhage, abscess, or the formation of pseudocysts. Laboratory evaluation often reveals increased amylase and lipase activity. Acute pyelonephritis (Choice E) typically presents as fever, nausea, vomiting, and flank pain with associated costovertebral angle tenderness on physical examination. Pyelonephritis most commonly occurs from ascending urinary tract infections. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (Choice F) typically presents as burning epigastric and lower chest pain, often in association with consumption of a large meal or trigger food, such as an acidic beverage, coffee, chocolate, or tomatoes. It is often worse with supine positioning. Mallory-Weiss syndrome (Choice G) refers to a partial-thickness tear in the distal esophageal mucosa near the gastroesophageal junction. This occurs in the setting of severe, repetitive vomiting, and typically presents as self-resolving, small-volume hematemesis. A ruptured esophagus (Choice I) may occur from forceful vomiting (Boerhaave syndrome), trauma, invasive malignancy, or inflammation.

A) Bile duct obstruction from migrating worms B) Hemolytic anemia C) Hepatitis C D) Resorption of an old hematoma E) Transfusion reaction Correct Answer: A. Bile duct obstruction from migrating worms is the likely cause of this patient's jaundice with evidence of Ascaris lumbricoides within the bowel. Ascaris lumbricoides, also known as a giant roundworm, is commonly transmitted through fecal-oral routes via ova within feces. After ingestion, the intestinal larvae can infiltrate the wall of the small bowel, and penetrate into blood vessels, where they may migrate to the lungs. Once in the lungs, they are coughed up and swallowed again. Final development into adult worms occurs within the small bowel, where they continue to produce eggs. Complications include bowel obstruction at the ileocecal valve and retrograde migration within the biliary tree. This can result in subsequent biliary obstruction, which leads to jaundice and direct hyperbilirubinemia. Treatment includes administration of antihelminthics (e.g., albendazole, ivermectin). Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Hemolytic anemia {Choice B) occurs secondary to a variety of intrinsic or extrinsic factors resulting in lysis of red blood cells. This typically presents as a normocytic anemia and indirect hyperbilirubinemia with associated increased lactate dehydrogenase and decreased haptoglobin. Hepatitis C {Choice C) is an RNA flavivirus that can result in chronic hepatic infection and an increased risk for cirrhosis. It can result in progressive liver dysfunction, usually characterized by a derangement in transaminases. It would be unlikely to result in a direct hyperbilirubinemia with otherwise normal liver function and no evidence of cirrhosis.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Proctocolectomy is the most appropriate next step in management for a patient with a history of ulcerative colitis complicated by the development of colorectal carcinoma. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition within the spectrum of inflammatory bowel disease that results in inflammation and ulceration of the colonic mucosa and submucosa, typically beginning with the rectum and advancing proximally. Symptoms include chronic abdominal pain, weight loss, bloody diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and tenesmus. Imaging typically demonstrates loss of haustral markings. Diagnosis of ulcerative colitis is by colonoscopy and biopsy, which demonstrates characteristic crypt abscesses. Because of the chronic inflammation of the colon, patients are at a substantially increased risk for developing colorectal carcinoma. Screening colonoscopy is indicated every 1 to 2 years starting 8 to 10 years after diagnosis. Colorectal carcinoma of the descending and sigmoid colon is often infiltrative and partially obstructive, producing apple-core lesions on contrast barium enemas. Following appropriate staging diagnostic studies, definitive management should entail proctocolectomy, which will serve to appropriately remove the current colorectal carcinoma, curtail future risk for colorectal carcinoma, and provide curative management of the patient's ulcerative colitis.",

Diverticulitis presents as left lower quadrant abdominal pain, sometimes accompanied by diarrhea, fever, and tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant. Radiation therapy (Choice C) may be necessary for adjuvant treatment of the patient's colorectal cancer but should take place after surgical resection with proctocolectomy. Segmental colectomy (Choice D) may allow for the adequate removal of the patient's colorectal carcinoma, but it would leave the remainder of the colon in place, which would not improve the patient's ulcerative colitis symptoms or reduce the risk for future colorectal carcinoma. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (Choice E) is a form of intravenous nutrition. It should be reserved for patients unable to receive adequate caloric and nutrient intake through an enteral route. TPN may be necessary for a short interval following the patient's proctocolectomy until enteral feeding can be appropriately resumed. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 33 of 50 'I"

Autonomy posits that patients have the right to make their decisions provided that they have the decision-making capacity to do so, and that they have been provided with appropriate information for use in making such a decision. A consenting adult with decision-making capacity has the right to refuse some or all aspects of medical care, even if such a decision may result in short- or long-term morbidity or mortality. While the patient initially consented to the operation, he then expressed concern after an adverse reaction and demanded the procedure be canceled. Provided that the physician determines the patient has appropriate capacity, the patient may elect to refuse the procedure at any time, even after signing the consent form.

While hemorrhoids can result in bright red blood per rectum, bleeding is generally mild and unlikely to cause microcytic anemia. Meckel diverticulum (Choice C) is one of the most common causes of painless, bloody stools in children. A Meckel diverticulum results from persistence of the vitelline duct and can demonstrate ectopic, functional gastric or pancreatic tissue. It typically presents in childhood, most commonly before age 2 years. Peptic ulcer (Choice D) disease describes the presence of ulcers in the stomach or duodenum, which classically present with worsening abdominal pain related to the consumption (gastric) or lack of consumption (duodenal) of food. Complications include perforation, stricture formation, and upper GI bleeding, which can present with either melena or hematochezia, depending on the rate of hemorrhage. Small-bowel malignancy (Choice E) is rare. The most common malignant small bowel tumors are carcinoid, lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma, and adenocarcinoma.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Maintain the dose of morphine and initiate a daily regimen of oral cathartics and stool softeners is the most appropriate next step in management for adequate treatment of the patient's cancer-related pain and opioid induced constipation. The patient has a history of metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma. To provide the patient with sufficient comfort for his metastatic cancer-related pain, opioid medications are an appropriate first line analgesic medication. While the overall use of opioid medications in the general public should be limited and alternative therapies instituted in the management of chronic pain because of the risk for addiction, opioids are the most effective at providing relief in cancer-related pain. A common adverse effect of opioid medication use is constipation because of opioid-associated bowel hypomotility and increased anal sphincter tone impairing the defecation reflex. Oral cathartics (e.g., magnesium citrate) and stool softeners (e.g., docusate) should be initiated to assist the patient in defecation.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Maintain the dose of morphine and advise the patient to increase intake of fluids would not appropriately treat the patient's opioid-induced constipation, as the constipation is secondary to decreased bowel motility and increased anal sphincter tone. Increased fluid intake would not adequately counteract the patient's constipation, as physiologically nearly all fluid would still be absorbed by the colon prior to defecation. Decrease the dose of morphine to allow normal evacuation of the bowels (Choice C) and discontinue the morphine and begin nonsteroidal analgesic therapy (Choice E) would not be appropriate, as opioid analgesics are the first-line pain relieving medication for cancer-related pain. Decreasing the dose of morphine or switching to a nonsteroidal analgesic would not appropriately treat the patient's pain and may result in unnecessary discomfort. Discontinue the morphine and begin hydromorphone therapy (Choice D) would not adequately treat the patient's opioid-induced constipation, as hydromorphone would continue to result in inadequate evacuation of the bowel without the addition of bowel cathartics and stool softeners. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 39 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Laparoscopy is indicated for the evaluation of acute lower abdominal or pelvic pain associated with an ovarian mass. The differential diagnosis for a tender adnexal mass resulting in acute pain includes ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, tuba-ovarian abscess, appendicitis, and a ruptured ovarian cyst. Given that the mass is located within the ovary, is exquisitely tender, and the pregnancy test is negative, the potential for ovarian torsion is high. Ovarian torsion occurs secondary to hypermobility of the ovary or the presence of a large adnexal mass. Patients typically present with acute lower abdominal and pelvic pain, which may be lateralized to the side of torsion, along with nausea and vomiting. Evaluation of ovarian torsion includes visualization with ultrasonography, which can assess the size, features, underlying mass, and blood flow of the ovary. Treatment includes supportive therapy, pain management, and definitive intervention with laparoscopy to evaluate the adnexa, attempt detorsion of the ovary, and if necessary, remove a nonviable ovary or any suspicious, predisposing ovarian masses.",

        "A": "Carcinoma encompasses many types of breast carcinoma, including invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, inflammatory breast carcinoma, and cystosarcoma phyllodes. The most common type is invasive ductal carcinoma, which typically presents as a palpable, immobile breast mass, which may demonstrate features such as spiculated margins and microcalcifications on mammography.",
        "B": "Fibroadenoma is one of the most common benign breast masses in patients younger than age 35 years. It typically presents as a well-circumscribed, solid, mobile mass that demonstrates an increase in size in relation to the menstrual cycle or during pregnancy secondary to increased estrogen levels. Fibroadenomas are not typically cystic.",
        "C": "Echocardiography does not have a defined role in the evaluation of a pneumothorax, as it solely evaluates the heart and pericardium. Bedside ultrasonography can be used to evaluate for the presence of a pneumothorax, although tension pneumothorax is typically a clinical diagnosis requiring emergent intervention. Radionuclide lung scan (Choice E), also known as a ventilation-perfusion scan, utilizes the administration of radionuclide compounds to evaluate the ventilation and perfusion of the lungs. This allows for the evaluation of acute pulmonary emboli when a CT scan may be contraindicated. Pulmonary angiography (Choice G) constitutes invasive catheter angiographic evaluation of the pulmonary arteries. This is no longer necessary for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism given advances in ventilation perfusion scans and CT pulmonary angiography, but it may still be performed if pulmonary embolectomy is required. Pulmonary artery catheterization (Choice H) allows for the measurement of right-sided heart, pulmonary arterial, and capillary wedge pressures, which are useful in the evaluation and management of shock (especially cardiogenic), right-sided heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 49 of 50 'I 49 . A 62-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of pain in his calves and thighs after he walks more than two blocks . The pain is relieved after he rests for 5 to 10 minutes . He has smoked one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years . His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F) , pulse is 75/min , respirations are 16/min , and blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg. Examination shows decreased femoral , popliteal , and pedal pulses bilaterally . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Aortoiliac occlusive disease (Leriche syndrome } B) Bilateral iliac aneurysms C) Bilateral superficial femoral artery occlusions D) Coarctation of the aorta E) Internal iliac artery stenosis Correct Answer: A. Aortoiliac occlusive disease (Leriche syndrome) is a type of peripheral arterial disease resulting from partial or complete occlusion of the infrarenal abdominal aorta and/or bilateral common iliac arteries. This presents as intermittent claudication of the bilateral lower extremities, with a characteristic triad of bilateral thigh and buttock claudication, absent/reduced femoral pulses, and impotence. The most common location for occlusive disease is at the aortic bifurcation, although occlusion can be multifocal and in various distributions. It is associated with large-vessel vasculitis (e.g., Takayasu arteritis), atherosclerosis, increased age, male sex, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Diagnosis occurs through a combination of physical examination findings, ankle brachia! index measurement, and CT or MR angiography. Treatment requires revascularization with angioplasty, stent placement, or vascular bypass. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Bilateral iliac artery aneurysms (Choice B) occur secondary to weakness of the arterial wall, resulting in bulging and aneurysmal dilation of the artery. They are commonly associated with atherosclerosis, with similar risk factors to abdominal aortic aneurysms. Aneurysms would not likely result in bilateral claudication symptoms unless concomitant arterial thrombosis or occlusive atherosclerotic disease was present. Bilateral superficial femoral artery occlusions (Choice C) can occur in the setting of severe atherosclerotic disease, although it would not result in loss of bilateral common femoral pulses. A central lesion resulting in occlusion of the distal aorta and bilateral iliac arteries is a more likely explanation for the patient's presentation and exam findings. Coarctation of the aorta (Choice D) is a cause of secondary hypertension related to narrowing of the thoracic aorta. It most commonly presents in childhood with differential blood pressure between upper and lower extremities, and it can result in bilateral lower extremity claudication. It is associated with bicuspid aortic valve and Turner syndrome. Internal iliac artery stenosis (Choice E) can result in claudication symptoms of the buttocks via the superior and inferior gluteal arterial branches. It would not likely result in thigh or calf claudication. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 50 of 50 'I",
        "D": "Galactocele presents as a painless breast lump typically following the cessation of lactation. Aspiration would demonstrate milky fluid. Paget disease (Choice E) of the breast presents as eczema-like patches on the nipple. It is associated with underlying ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma of the breast. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 44 of 50 'I 44 . A 27-year-old man undergoes Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity . He has type 2 diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and sleep apnea . Twelve hours after the operation , he is awake and alert . He is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 139 kg (305 lb); BMI is 45 kg/m 2 His temperature is 38.1° C (100 .6°F), pulse is 90/min , respirations are 10/min , and blood pressure is 145/85 mm Hg. Breath sounds are heard bilaterally with decreased air • movement. Arterial blood gas analysis on 4 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula shows : 7.31 55 mm Hg 64 mm Hg 26 mEq/L Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) AEJ.Qlication of continuous ositive airway pressure B) Switching from nasal cannula to face mask C) Bronchodilator therapy D) Naloxone therapy E) Reintubation Correct Answer: A. Application of continuous positive airway pressure is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's hypoxemia, hypoventilation, and respiratory acidosis, which are likely multifactorial on the basis of postoperative pain, sleep apnea, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. In the postoperative state, patients are at increased risk for poor ventilation and resultant atelectasis. This risk is further pronounced in patients with morbid obesity, decreased mobility, sleep apnea, and underlying lung or heart disease. The patient presents with decreased air movement on lung auscultation, bradypnea, and an arterial blood gas demonstrating hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acute respiratory acidosis. To improve this patient's ventilation and oxygenation, postoperative pain should be controlled to reduce ventilation-associated discomfort, and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), should be used to promote oxygenation through resolution of atelectasis and ventilation through maintained patency of the airway. If the patient remains hypercapnic in spite of pain control and CPAP, bi level positive airway pressure (Bi PAP) should be attempted next, which will promote increased minute ventilation by assisting inhalational effort. CPAP may stent the airways open, but if this is not sufficient to promote ventilation, escalation to BiPAP or invasive positive pressure ventilation may be required. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Switching from nasal cannula to face mask (Choice B) would allow for a higher oxygen delivery to the patient, but this may not improve the patient's ventilation as it would not promote airway stenting via continuous positive airway pressure during inhalation and exhalation. Bronchodilator therapy (Choice C) is classically used in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. While this assists in reducing airway obstruction through bronchodilation, this patient's ventilatory derangement stems from postoperative pain, sleep apnea, postoperative atelectasis, and probable obesity hypoventilation syndrome, which is more appropriately managed with positive airway pressure. Naloxone therapy (Choice D) is used for the reversal of opiate overdose or excessive sedation. This patient is awake and alert, making an opiate overdose unlikely.",
        "E": "Reintubation would be an appropriate step in management if noninvasive positive pressure ventilation does not improve the patient's respiratory acidosis, hypoxia, and hypoventilation. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should be attempted first unless the patient presents in an altered mental state or coma and is unable to protect his or her airway. r O , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 45 of 50 45 . A 92-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 6 hours after the sudden onset of abdominal pain, distention , and vomiting . She has not passed flatus during this period . She underwent appendectomy 46 years ago . Abdominal examination shows distention and diffuse tenderness . Bowel sounds are increased . An x-ray of the abdomen is shown. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings? A) Adhesions B) Appendiceal phlegmon C) Gallstone ileus D) lntussusception E) Primary tumor of the small intestine Correct Answer: A. Adhesions are the most common cause of small-bowel obstruction (SBO) in a patient with a history of prior intra-abdominal surgery. Obstruction of the small bowel occurs from partial or complete blockage of the small bowel lumen and typically presents as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and abdominal distention. Partial SBOs will allow a degree of continued flatus with diminished stooling, and complete obstruction will result in obstipation. SBO has many potential causes, although the most common are post-surgical peritoneal adhesions and hernias. On physical examination, SBO typically presents as diffuse abdominal tenderness, distention, tympany to percussion, and borborygmi (high pitched, hyperactive bowel sounds). Potential complications of SBO include bowel rupture or necrosis, which can result in abrupt peritonitic abdominal signs, such as rebound tenderness and guarding. Abdominal x-rays, if obtained in the erect position, typically demonstrate multiple air-fluid levels in the setting of dilated small bowel loops. Management requires bowel rest, intravenous hydration, and surgical intervention. If the patient has a partial obstruction, the patient should be monitored and provided supportive care. If the patient demonstrates features concerning for a persistent partial or complete obstruction, an exploratory laparotomy should be performed to alleviate the cause of the obstruction. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Appendiceal phlegmon (Choice B) is a potential complication of acute appendicitis, particularly in the setting of perforated appendicitis. It refers to an inflammatory mass-like collection consisting of the inflamed appendix, adjacent involved viscera, and peritoneum. Treatment typically requires appendectomy. Gallstone ileus (Choice C) is a cause of mechanical SBO secondary to lodging of a gallstone at the ileocecal valve. This is a potential complication of recurrent acute or chronic cholecystitis resulting in the formation of a cholecystoduodenal fistula, which can allow for the passage of gallstones into the gastrointestinal tract lumen. lntussusception (Choice D) describes telescoping of one segment of bowel into another, which can cause intestinal ischemia or obstruction. It is typically caused by a pathologic lead point (e.g., malignancy, stricture, lymphadenopathy), and presents as colicky pain and bloating. Primary tumors of the small intestine (Choice E) are rare. The most common malignant small-bowel tumors are carcinoid, lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma, and adenocarcinoma. If large enough, tumors can result in partial or complete SBO, although postsurgical adhesions are much more likely in this patient. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 46 of 50 'I 46 .

Laboratory studies show : Hemoglobin A 8% c 1 Leukocyte count 8700/mm 3 with a normal differential Serum Glucose 160 mg/dL Creatinine 1.8 mg/dL On duplex ultrasonography of the left lower extremity , the femoral and popliteal arteries appear normal ; there is occlusion of all three tibial arteries in the proximal calf and reconstitution of the posterior tibial artery just proximal to the ankle . In addition to continued piperacillin-tazobactam therapy and foot care, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Below-the-knee amputation B Femorotibial bYJ)ass grafting C) High-dose clopidogrel therapy D) Percutaneous tibial angioplasty E) Supervised exercise program Correct Answer: B. Femorotibial bypass grafting is a potential treatment for severe peripheral arterial disease of the lower extremity. Peripheral arterial disease refers to the abnormally diminished flow of blood to the extremities secondary to atherosclerotic plaque. This most commonly affects the lower extremities. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, increased age, cigarette smoking, and dyslipidemia. Patients typically present with initial intermittent claudication, which results from insufficient blood flow to the muscles during exercise. As the flow of blood becomes progressively diminished with worsening atherosclerosis, it can present as pain at rest and the potential for ischemia and necrosis (gangrene) of the extremity. On examination, there are typically diminished or absent pulses in the distribution of the affected arteries. If there is critical ischemia of the extremity, gangrene may also ensue. Duplex ultrasonography or arteriography (catheter-based, CT scan, or MRI) of the lower extremities can be performed to evaluate the location and length of atherosclerotic disease and its impact on vessel luminal diameter and blood flow. Treatment includes instituting an exercise program, cilostazol, aspirin, and, if severe, angioplasty, stenting, or surgical arterial bypass. Amputation may be necessary if the degree of gangrene is significant. The patient presents with intact femoral and popliteal arteries but occluded calf arteries, although the distal posterior tibial artery demonstrates reconstitution. A femorotibial bypass graft placement would restore blood flow to the distal lower extremity. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Below-the-knee amputation (Choice A) is not indicated at this time, as the patient demonstrates gangrene of only his left second distal phalanx. Amputation is only indicated in the setting of severe gangrene of the lower extremity or if it is complicated by superinfection or necrotizing fasciitis. High-dose clopidogrel therapy (Choice C) is an antiplatelet medication that can be used in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease, although this patient is presenting with severe occlusion of his distal lower extremity, which requires surgical management at this point. Percutaneous tibial angioplasty (Choice D) is a potential intervention to improve lower extremity blood flow through catheter-based angioplasty and/or stenting. Because of the degree of occlusion in the calf blood vessels, tibial angioplasty may be impossible or impractical. Bypass grafting would provide an easier conduit for restoration of blood flow. Supervised exercise program (Choice E) is a recommended first-line therapy for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease as it stimulates the development of collateral circulation. This patient requires more urgent management involving bypass grafting. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 47 of 50 'I 47 . A 72-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of hematochezia for 12 hours . He has mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and osteoarthritis . He sustained a myocardial infarction 4 months ago . Medications include propranolol and nitroglycerin . His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4 °F), pulse is 102/min , and blood pressure is 144/82 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities . Rectal examination shows dark blood and clots . His hematocrit is 32% . The bleeding resolves spontaneously 6 hours after admission . Colonoscopy shows a short segment of sigmoid colon with edema, ulceration , and friability; no other abnormalities are noted . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Clostridium difficile colitis B) Cytomegalovirus colitis C) Diverticulitis D) lschemic colitis E) Ulcerative colitis CorrectAnswer: D. lschemic colitis refers to inadequate blood supply to the colon, which can lead to bowel wall necrosis, loss of immune barriers, and bowel perforation. lschemic colitis most commonly occurs in the setting of atherosclerosis resulting in plaque rupture within a mesenteric vessel, systemic hypotension (e.g., shock), or emboli such as in atrial fibrillation. Diminished blood flow within a vascular territory results if a specific mesenteric artery is occluded or narrowed. In the case of systemic hypotension, blood flow will be reduced within a watershed region. Patients typically present with acute abdominal pain and cramping associated with bloody bowel movements if bowel necrosis has occurred. Imaging may demonstrate thickening of the bowel wall along with pneumatosis intestinalis and possible portal venous gas or pneumoperitoneum. Diagnosis of ischemic colitis requires angiographic evaluation to assess the patency of the mesenteric arteries. Treatment of occlusive lesions includes anticoagulation, thrombectomy, angioplasty, and/or stenting. Hypoperfusion states require treatment with fluids, blood products, or vasopressors. In cases of necrosis or perforation, a bowel resection or partial colectomy may be required. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Clostridium difficile colitis (Choice A) is an opportunistic infection that commonly occurs after the use of antibiotics because of loss of native colonic microbiota. It typically presents as abdominal pain and severe watery or bloody diarrhea, and it may result in complications such as fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon. Cytomegalovirus colitis (Choice B) is an opportunistic infection commonly occurring in immunocompromised patients in the setting of solid-organ or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, severe ulcerative colitis, or AIDS. It presents as abdominal pain, fever, weight loss, and watery or bloody diarrhea."

The time course of this patient's fever (several hours after the start of the transfusion) and normal laboratory studies are consistent with an acute febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR), which is the most common type of transfusion reaction. FNHTR occurs because of the presence of preformed antibodies on donor leukocyte antigens and from cytokines in the plasma component of the transfused sample. It is typically mild in severity and resolves with supportive care. If symptoms occur during the transfusion, it should be paused to rule out ABO incompatibility.

Subtypes of basal cell carcinoma include those that are less invasive, such as superficial and nodular, and those that are more invasive, such as infiltrative and morpheaform. In all subtypes, the risk of metastasis is low, though the tumors can invade locally and cause significant tissue damage. Biopsy may be performed with a variety of techniques, including excisional, shave, or punch biopsy.

Other signs of congestive heart failure can include shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and production of frothy sputum in left-sided failure, while right-sided failure is characterized by an increased jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral extremity edema. Anesthesia and surgery place significant stress on the body, and myocardial demand can exceed cardiac output, especially in an older patient with underlying coronary artery disease. Additionally, surgeries complicated by blood loss and fluid shifting may result in the need for administration of several liters of crystalloid or blood product to maintain hemodynamic stability. Treatment of an acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure consists of diuresis and respiratory support (eg, supplemental oxygen, positive pressure ventilation), and in more severe cases, intravenous positive inotropes and a ventricular assist device may be needed if cardiogenic shock is occurring.",

This patient has abdominal pain associated with hypertension, tachycardia, and respiratory splinting (eg, shallow breaths due to pain), the latter of which puts her at increased risk for atelectasis and consequent pneumonia. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is a frequently used option for controlling postoperative pain with opioid analgesics, such as morphine, hydromorphone, and fentanyl. Typical PCA set-ups include a basal rate, a bolus dose with a lockout interval, and a total hourly limit. Benefits of PCA use include improved patient satisfaction, titratability, and decreased risk for sedation given the frequent, smaller boluses, as compared to larger bolus doses that would be given less frequently by nursing staff. However, PCAs are associated with an overall increase in opioid usage. Basal rates are rarely used, as they can be associated with increased respiratory depression and overdose; therefore, they are often reserved for opioid tolerant patients.

Symptoms include dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, and, occasionally, lightheadedness or syncope. Clinical signs include tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia, and, if massive, hypotension. Risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and subsequent PE include prolonged immobility, hypercoagulability, and tissue injury. Postsurgical DVT and consequent PE are common, as surgical patients, especially those with malignancy, have many of the risk factors that put them at increased risk for the development of venous stasis and clot formation. These often develop 5 to 7days after a procedure, and prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin is frequently instituted to prevent their formation. Thus, in this cancer patient with dyspnea, tachycardia, and tachypnea 6 days following a surgical procedure, PE is the most likely diagnosis. Treatment includes therapeutic anticoagulation.",

Additionally, alcoholic gastritis independent of cirrhosis and portal hypertension is a common source of gastrointestinal bleeding. In cirrhosis, obliteration of the hepatic sinusoids through progressive fibrosis increases the resistance to blood flow through the liver, which is transmitted to the portal venous system causing portal hypertension. When engorged secondary to portal hypertension, esophageal veins can be visualized on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) as vertical dilations underneath the esophageal mucosa, representing dilated submucosal veins (termed ‘varices’). Varices are usually treated endoscopically by band ligation, and patients with cirrhosis must be screened for them, as the risk of life-threatening upper gastrointestinal bleeding is high. The definitive emergent treatment for any source of upper gastrointestinal bleeding is EGD, as it permits both identification of (and sometimes biopsy of) the source (diagnostic) and intervention to control bleeding (therapeutic).

Endoscopic interventions are the definitive treatment for active variceal hemorrhage. The two most common methods are variceal banding (also called variceal ligation) and sclerotherapy. Banding involves placement of small elastic bands to ligate the bleeding vessel. Sclerotherapy involves injection of a sclerosing solution in the vicinity of the vessel. Risk factors for variceal bleeding include the varix size, anatomical appearance, coagulopathy, and severity of cirrhosis.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "An inguinal hernia occurs when a loop of bowel protrudes through the abdominal wall at and around the inguinal canal. Symptoms include a bulge in the groin or scrotum, with associated heaviness or a dull pain, often worsened with increased abdominal pressure during straining. Risk factors for their development include male sex, advanced age, chronic cough or constipation, smoking, and abdominal wall injury. Congenital hernias are caused by failure of the processus vaginalis to close, whereas acquired hernias are caused by a weakness in the abdominal musculature. Indirect inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia, often congenital, and occur when the hernia protrudes through the internal ring of the inguinal canal. Direct inguinal hernias are more commonly acquired and occur within Hesselbach’s triangle (bordered by the inguinal ligament, inferior epigastric vessels, and the rectus abdominis muscle). Incarceration occurs when the bowel loop is unable to reduce through the abdominal wall opening, which leads to edema and venous congestion of the bowel. Strangulation can occur with subsequent obstruction, ischemia, and necrosis, making both incarcerated and strangulated hernias a surgical emergency.

When present, candidemia often leads to severe sepsis with associated skin and ophthalmologic lesions. Other presenting symptoms are similar to those seen in bacteremia, such as fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, and leukocytosis. Central line catheters are often placed for the administration of vasopressors in critically ill patients, as an alternative for venous access in patients with difficult to obtain peripheral access, and for the long-term administration of medications (eg, antibiotics or chemotherapy). Unfortunately, blood infections associated with central lines are a known complication often caused by skin flora such as Staphylococcus spp., although they can also cause candidemia, as seen in this patient.

This leads to microvascular damage to capillaries throughout the body, including the vasa nervorum of the distal extremities, which impairs nerve function.

Diabetic neuropathy limits the healing response of the distal extremities and reduces the patient's awareness of injuries to the extremities, creating the conditions that result in the increased incidence of foot ulcerations in diabetic patients. Prolonged compression of soft tissues between bony prominences (such as the heads of the metatarsals) and hard surfaces (such as a shoe or floor) without offloading can result in breakdown of dermal tissue and ulceration. The feet and toenails should be carefully examined in all diabetic patients, especially those with known neuropathy, as these patients are at an increased risk for developing diabetic foot ulcers and infections.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Chronic kidney disease results in secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism caused by derangement of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. As the failing kidney is unable to regulate the level of blood calcium and phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations increase to promote increased serum calcium from gut, renal, and bone absorption, and to promote renal excretion of phosphorus. PTH levels remain persistently high in renal failure, and even after transplantation, the increased level can persist for several months or even a year or more. Following renal transplantation, the graft kidney will appropriately respond to PTH, which will result in reabsorption of calcium, and excretion of phosphorus. There are multiple proposed mechanisms beyond PTH to explain post-transplant hypophosphatemia, though PTH is postulated to play a primary role. Post-transplant, the kidney is also able to produce active Vitamin D, a function also lost in end-stage kidney disease. Vitamin D promotes gastrointestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, further contributing to restored serum levels of both, and affecting feedback on the parathyroid gland to produce PTH. The mechanism of electrolyte homeostasis following transplant is complex, though PTH and Vitamin D, among several other factors, play key roles.",

The ethical principle that applies most strongly in this case is autonomy, the right of the patient to ultimately decide what treatments they do and do not receive. In respecting autonomy, it is implied that the patient has capacity to make rational, informed, and voluntary decisions with reason and understanding. Society recognizes that age is a factor in the ability to make a fully reasoned choice with understanding, and the age at which patients are considered to have full autonomy is determined by the legal system. Generally, patients that are 18 years of age or older are considered to have full autonomy in medical decision-making. In this case, the moral decision is to respect the wishes of the patient. Additionally, this course of action also respects the principles of nonmaleficence and beneficence, as the patient has already experienced several adverse effects from treatment, and the additional experimental treatment is not yet known to provide any significant benefit with comparable mortality rates.",

AHTR is a life-threatening condition that occurs because of ABO incompatibility, which is often the result of clerical error. Patients with type A blood possess preformed antibodies against the B antigen on the surface of erythrocytes, while patients with type B blood possess antibodies against the A antigen. Those with AB blood lack preformed antibodies to both antigens, as they possess them on their own erythrocytes. Patients with type O blood have antibodies against both A and B antigen. Given this, it is critical that patients receive the appropriate type of blood for their specific blood type. As an example, patients with type A blood can only receive type A or type O blood from a donor, but not type B or AB blood. ABO incompatibility leads to AHTR, which results in profound hemolysis and often presents with flank pain, fever, hemoglobinuria, and a positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test, but may rapidly progress to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), shock, and death. Treatment includes immediate cessation of the transfusion followed by supportive care. The blood bank should be contacted immediately.",

TRALI is a syndrome characterized by respiratory distress, often with associated hypoxemia, cyanosis, fever, and new infiltrates on chest x-ray, that develops within 6 hours of transfusion of any blood product, including erythrocytes, fresh frozen plasma, or platelets. Frequently, symptoms develop within minutes to hours after starting transfusion. The pathogenesis of TRALI is thought to involve abnormal priming of neutrophils in the lung, which, when exposed to inflammatory cytokines present in transfused blood products, undergo widespread activation within the lung parenchyma. Release of cytokines and reactive oxygen species among other inflammatory components from activated neutrophils causes endothelial dysfunction and rapidly leads to non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. This contrasts with the pulmonary edema that develops in patients who develop respiratory failure secondary to transfusion associated cardiac overload (TACO). Treatment is with supportive care, which may include implementing non-invasive or invasive ventilation, vasopressors, and antipyretics. Importantly, patients who recover from TRALI can receive additional blood products, but these products should not be from the same prior blood donor.",

Subtypes of BCC include those that are less invasive, such as superficial and nodular, and those that are more invasive, such as infiltrative and morpheaform. In all subtypes, the risk of metastasis is low, though the tumors can invade locally and cause significant tissue damage. Complete surgical excision with a margin of between 5 mm to 1 cm is recommended as first line treatment for BCC located in noncritical areas that are amenable to complete resection with adequate margins.

A known history of atherosclerosis (eg, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease) identifies the likelihood of the condition being present in other locations as well. Patients with PAD typically present with intermittent claudication, which results from insufficient blood flow to the muscles during exercise. As the flow of blood becomes progressively diminished with worsening atherosclerosis, tissue perfusion may become inadequate to meet metabolic demands, and can present with pain at rest and the potential for ischemia and necrosis (gangrene) of the extremity. Dry gangrene is most common in patients with PAD, although wet gangrene may also occur. Revascularization surgery may allow for salvage of the limb and improve rest pain or non-healing wounds, but the presence of gangrene generally requires amputation.

Due to the chronic increased afterload from a fixed obstruction by the valve, left ventricular hypertrophy and resultant diastolic dysfunction can occur.

This most commonly affects the lower extremities. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, increased age, tobacco smoking, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Patients typically present with claudication caused by insufficient blood flow to the muscles during exercise, as is described in this patient's history. As the flow of blood becomes progressively diminished with worsening atherosclerosis, tissue perfusion may become inadequate to meet metabolic demands. In acute cases of limb ischemia, patients generally present with pain, pallor, paresthesia, loss of temperature sensation, paralysis, and pulselessness. Acute limb ischemia can complicate the state of already diminished vascular supply in PAD (such as when an existing plaque ruptures in- situ leading to thrombotic acute limb ischemia), or when an embolic source abruptly occludes an already narrowed vessel (such as in cases of atrial fibrillation). Atrial fibrillation, when suboptimally anticoagulated as in this case (the patient's risk factors merit initiation of a blood thinner beyond aspirin to prevent left atrial thrombosis and risk for thromboembolism) can result in distal embolization of thrombi. This leads to strokes, acute limb ischemia, mesenteric or renal ischemia, acute coronary syndromes, or other phenomena of end-organ hypoperfusion depending on the location of embolized clot. Acute management of thromboembolism includes anticoagulation, analgesics, and reperfusion procedures (eg, vascular bypass, endovascular or open thrombectomy).",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "If this patient remains untreated for his obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), he is at risk of developing cor pulmonale. OSA is characterized by intermittent obstruction of the upper airway leading to hypoxia and apnea. A history of snoring, followed by periods of witnessed apnea in association with daytime somnolence or morning headaches, is common. The severity of OSA is determined using the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and treatment of moderate to severe OSA is with the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device at night. The pressure supplied by a CPAP keeps the upper airway open, thereby preventing upper airway obstruction and apneic episodes. Severe, untreated OSA can lead to a variety of complications, including pulmonary hypertension. As the pulmonary circulation is usually a low-pressure system, the right ventricle is not equipped to pump against such increased pressures. Thus, pulmonary hypertension causes secondary right ventricular dysfunction, referred to as cor pulmonale. Cor pulmonale manifests in findings of right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy on ECG and chest x-ray with peripheral edema and hepatomegaly (signs of right-sided heart failure). The enlarged right ventricle is associated with a precordial heave on examination and a pronounced S,, given the increased pressure of the pulmonary system impacting the closure dynamics of the pulmonic valve. This patient has evidence of right ventricular dysfunction and should be treated with CPAP at night to prevent chronic hypoxia, pulmonary vasoconstriction, and irreversible right ventricular remodeling and failure.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Hypoventilation can be identified by decreased Po., increased Pco,, and a normal alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient on arterial blood gas analysis (ABG). In this case, the pH indicates a mild acidemia, the Pco, shows hypercapnia, and the Po, is at the lower range of normal. The A-a gradient can be estimated as a function of atmospheric pressure, Fio,, Po, and Pco,. Adjusting for the normal increase in A-a gradient associated with age, the patient's A-a gradient falls within an expected range. This suggests the etiology of his hypercapnic respiratory failure is secondary to decreased ventilation, which aligns with his history of obesity (BMI 52 kg/m2) and auscultation of decreased breath sounds bilaterally. To determine the acuity of his respiratory acidosis, an estimate can be made comparing the amount of decrease in his pH with the associated increase in Pco,. For acute respiratory acidosis, the expected change in pH = 0.008 x (Pco 40). For chronic respiratory acidosis, the expected change in pH = 0.003 x (Pco.- 40). In this case, the observed change in PH is ~0.09. This falls between the expected values for an acute (change of 0.13) or chronic (change of 0.05) respiratory acidosis; thus, the appropriate conclusion is that this represents an acute on chronic respiratory acidosis, which also agrees with the diagnosis of hypoventilation secondary to obesity.

Crohn disease is characterized by transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, most frequently involving the terminal ileum. It can arise anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract and is a subclass of inflammatory bowel disease. Most patients experience chronic abdominal cramping, bloody diarrhea, and weight loss. Examination often demonstrates generalized abdominal tenderness, sometimes worse in the right lower quadrant, and, depending on the severity and extent, may disclose complications such as enterocutaneous fistulas and extraintestinal manifestations such as uveitis. Severe Crohn disease can result in intestinal obstruction from stricture or inflammation, bowel perforation, intraabdominal abscess, and the formation of additional fistulas. Diagnosis occurs through imaging and biopsy. Laboratory analyses often show increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Fluoroscopic small bowel follow through commonly shows narrowing of the intestinal lumen at the terminal ileum, along with other additional sites of stricture or fistulous formation. Treatment depends upon the severity and extent of disease but often includes 5-aminosalicylic acid derivatives, topical or oral steroids, and biologic agents such as anti-TNF- inhibitors.

Patients typically present within the first two decades of life with painless rectal bleeding secondary to polyps, although other more severe manifestations include intussusception and malabsorptive syndromes. Colonoscopy often discloses numerous polyps, but the histology is characteristic and sets JPS apart from many other polyposis syndromes. Polyps in JPS may be of many different varieties, but the most common type are called hamartomas. Hamartomatous polyps are made up of various tissues within the gastrointestinal tract, and histologically, they have inflammatory cells within the lamina propria in addition to mucin-filled, dilated glands. Other associated findings include telangiectasias of the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, the liver, and the lungs. Iron deficiency anemia may develop in patients with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding and should be monitored.

Colonoscopy guidelines differ based upon whether patients have an underlying genetic disorder that predisposes them to premature colorectal cancer (CRC) such as Lynch syndrome, a history of inflammatory bowel disease, or a family history of CRC. The risk for colon cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) increases with the duration, extent, and activity of disease. Patients with extensive colitis, a history of uncontrolled inflammation, or a disease duration of greater than 10 years are at the highest risk for CRC. Those with proctitis, left sided colitis, and a history of well-controlled disease are at a lower risk of CRC. Regardless, all patients should undergo screening colonoscopy 8 years from the date of their diagnosis as the risk of CRC increases dramatically after this time.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient's presentation is highly concerning for toxic megacolon, a rare but known complication of ulcerative colitis. Toxic megacolon is a life-threatening medical emergency caused by extensive inflammation of the colon. The classic constellation of clinical manifestations includes high fever, tachycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, enlarged and dilated bowel, and impaired colonic motility. More generally, ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition within the spectrum of inflammatory bowel disease that results in inflammation and ulcers of the colonic mucosa, typically beginning with the rectum and advancing proximally. Symptoms include chronic abdominal pain, weight loss, bloody diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and tenesmus. Extraintestinal manifestations such as uveitis also occur. In addition, because of the chronic inflammation of the colon, patients are at increased risk of developing colorectal carcinoma. Treatment of ulcerative colitis flares includes supportive care, immunomodulators, biologics, and steroids. In severe cases, a partial or total colectomy may be required, especially in cases of toxic megacolon.",

It can be caused by an occlusion of the mesenteric vasculature, such as from thromboembolism or dissection, or from hypotension or limited blood flow causing a watershed infarction. Aortic surgery is a known risk factor for ischemic colitis, often because of dislodgement of endovascular plaques with subsequent embolization, or because of hypotension. Risk factors for acute ischemic colitis include older age, coronary artery disease, hypercoagulability, peripheral arterial disease, or recent endovascular surgery. Typical symptoms of patients with acute ischemic colitis include crampy abdominal pain, tenderness over the affected bowel, and hematochezia. Ischemic colitis can be complicated by necrosis, viscus perforation, or ileus.

Oral administration of non-opiate medications may be helpful for pain control, but many patients may require opioid analgesics to control severe pain. Typically, the approach to adequately controlling pain is multimodal. While opioid medications can offer strong analgesia, opiates are central nervous system depressants and can lead to dependence, addiction, and death. Opiate intoxication causes sedation, bradycardia and hypotension, depressed respiratory drive, and constricted pupils. Opiates are commonly used for analgesia and act on receptors within the gastrointestinal tract, reducing gut motility and thus causing constipation. Adjunctive pain medications, such as acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, gabapentin, and others, can help reduce the use of opiate medications and reduce the risk for its side effects, tolerance, and dependence. Short-term therapy following surgery with opiate compounds is indicated, though care should be taken to avoid prolonged use due to the risk of side effects and dependence.",

Classically, benign etiologies of neonatal jaundice will improve by the second to third week of life, whereas biliary atresia will persist and often worsen within the first 8 weeks of life. Diagnosis consists of history and physical examination, liver function testing, HIDA scan or cholangiography, with definitive diagnosis occurring during exploratory surgery with visualization of atretic bile ducts.

Acute kidney injury can be prerenal (because of dehydration, low vascular perfusion states such as congestive heart failure, or intrinsic such as acute tubular necrosis) or postrenal because of obstruction. A common cause is acute tubular necrosis, which can be caused by ischemia in the setting of prolonged hypoperfusion or toxins. A way to distinguish between the causes of acute kidney injury is by measuring the fractional excretion of sodium. The fractional excretion of a solute measures the percentage of the original filtered amount that is present in the excreted urine. The calculations are made using the plasma and urine concentrations of the sodium and creatinine. Prerenal and intrinsic kidney injury can be distinguished by the fractional excretion of sodium, which is <1% in prerenal and >2% in intrinsic kidney injury. In acute tubular necrosis, laboratory evaluation will show a blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio of less than 20, a fractional excretion of sodium greater than 2%, and muddy brown casts on urinalysis.",

Further diagnostic evaluation of a breast mass depends on the patient's age, as well as the clinical concern for malignancy, and typically includes mammography and/or ultrasonography, in addition to biopsy when indicated. Although a significant portion of breast masses are benign, they may be associated with future malignancy. Lobular carcinoma in situ is a benign proliferative lesion with atypical cell characteristics that most commonly occurs in pre- menopausal women. However, it is associated with an increase in the risk of development of invasive breast carcinoma, which may occur in either the ipsilateral or contralateral breast, although it is not considered a precursor lesion.

Loss of appropriate PTH production leads to hypocalcemia, with resultant symptoms that include perioral paresthesia, carpopedal spasm, laryngospasm, and prolonged QT interval. The Chvostek sign, in which tapping of the facial nerve leads to spasm of the facial muscles, and Trousseau sign, in which an inflated blood pressure cuff occluding the brachial artery causes carpopedal spasm, are two physical examination findings that may indicate hypocalcemia.

Its secretion is stimulated by increased plasma osmolality and decreased arterial blood volume. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH) occurs when ADH is secreted independently of plasma osmolality or arterial blood volume. This most commonly occurs in neurologic injury, as a medication side effect, or because of ectopic production by a malignant tumor or lung disease. However, surgery can also cause an increase in secretion of ADH, thought to be secondary to pain. Inappropriate secretion of ADH in relation to plasma osmolality and blood volume results in decreased urine output; when this occurs, the residual urine is concentrated, with urine studies showing a urine osmolality above 100 mOsmol/kg and urine sodium above 40 mEq/L. While hypovolemia or obstruction can cause oliguria, these would likely also increase the patient's serum urea nitrogen and creatinine.

Other causes of postoperative hypotension include under-resuscitation during the procedure, medication side effects, and sepsis. Hypovolemia, whether due to anemia or fluid depletion, results in a compensatory tachycardia to try to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP). However, with significant enough hypovolemia, the tachycardia is unable to maintain the MAP, the blood pressure subsequently falls, and the patient becomes hypotensive. Other evidence of postoperative bleeding in this patient includes a decrease in hematocrit from 42% to 28% (although a decrease in hematocrit may not always be present with an acute bleed), and a low central venous pressure indicating hypovolemia. Other signs of bleeding include pallor and swelling or ecchymoses of the surgical site. Management of postoperative hypotension caused by bleeding includes fluid resuscitation, blood product transfusion, pressor therapy, and prompt surgical re-exploration.",

For example, patients with altered mental status or who are intubated and sedated lack the capacity to make decisions, which may be caused by the inability to understand the consent process or the inability to vocalize their desires. In this situation, the healthcare provider must receive consent from the patient’s health care proxy. While different states have varying laws about the hierarchy of decision-makers, spouses, parents, and siblings are often included. This patient has had ongoing mechanical ventilatory requirements, and she is unlikely to wean from the mechanical ventilator soon given her recurrent hypoxia and hypercarbia. Prolonged orotracheal intubation can lead to laryngeal edema, tracheal stenosis, and oropharyngeal ulcers, whereas the placement of a tracheostomy improves patient comfort, allows them to communicate, and facilitates the ventilator weaning process.
