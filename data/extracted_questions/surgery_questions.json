Myocardial infarction can present nonspecifically but classically occurs with shortness of breath, chest pain, light-headedness, nausea, vomiting, or altered mental status, and may be complicated by cardiogenic shock, seen as tachycardia, hypotension, and impaired end-organ perfusion (cool extremities, low urine output). In postoperative cases, especially with intubated patients, it may be difficult to assess the presence of myocardial infarction. Evaluation using ECG, serial troponin assays, and echocardiogram should be considered in such cases. Right-heart catheterization can be used to determine cardiac output and index, along with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which can distinguish right heart failure from left heart failure. An increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure indicates that filling pressures in the left heart are abnormal, which is consistent with myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Pneumothorax results from air entering the intrapleural space from either an external (e.g., stab wound) or internal (e.g., ruptured bleb or bronchus, bronchopleural fistula) source. As the air accumulates within the space, the lung parenchyma becomes compressed, resulting in reduced breath sounds, respiratory distress, and, in severe cases, tension on the mediastinal structures impeding venous return. In cases of acute trauma, evacuating the accumulated air permits expansion of the lung and elimination of tension on the great vessels; this is done through needle decompression in cases of tension pneumothorax, tube thoracostomy, or both. Once a tube thoracostomy is placed and healing of the inciting injury occurs, leakage of air into the pleural space should stop. If a persistent air leak is noted, the source of the leak should be investigated. A ruptured bronchus requires extended time to heal and is one source of a potential air leak. If the leak persists, surgical correction of the rupture may be required to prevent chronic pneumothorax from a resultant bronchopleural fistula. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, and D. Esophageal injury (Choice A) can result in pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax, and, if severe, bacterial mediastinitis can occur. While diminished breath sounds may occur in the setting of an esophageal injury, additional findings such as mediastinal crepitus, crunching on auscultation, and signs of sepsis would likely be present. Open pneumothorax (Choice B) would be detected on examination as a penetrating wound in continuity with the pleural space. Tension pneumothorax (Choice D) occurs when air accumulates within the pleural cavity to an extent that results in compression and shifting of the mediastinal structures. Such structural compromise results in impaired venous return leading to diminished cardiac output. It typically presents as severe respiratory distress, jugular venous distention, tracheal deviation, diminished breath sounds, hyperresonance to percussion, and hemithorax hyperinflation. Vital signs will show tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension. r \" , r-- r ,",

In some cases, the SDH may be large enough to compress the adjacent brain parenchyma; the displacement of the underlying cerebral hemisphere can result in neurologic deficits, altered mental status, seizures, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Alcohol use disorder is associated with cerebral atrophy, which causes traction on bridging cortical veins, such that minor trauma can result in shearing of the veins leading to hemorrhage. Untreated, the SDH presents the risk for continuing to grow in size, which can result in herniation of central nervous system structures if large enough.

Ventilation is a complex process driven by the somatic and autonomic nervous systems and requires an intact central nervous system without dysfunction of the brain stem, spinal cord, or efferent nerves (e.g., phrenic, intercostal). It also requires an unobstructed airway, unrestricted and semirigid chest wall, normal neuromuscular function, normal circulatory function , and normal pulmonary parenchymal and stromal function. Derangement within any part of this process can result in insufficient ventilation. Spinal anesthesia can reduce neuromuscular function distal to the level of the block. In turn, insufficient rate or depth of ventilation will result in retained carbon dioxide and development of acute respiratory acidosis. Acute respiratory acidosis typically demonstrates a decrease in pH with increased PCO on arterial blood gas. Hypoxia may be present. With cessation of neuromuscular blockade, respiratory mechanics should return to baseline, and result in 2 progressive resolution of the acid-base disturbance. In severe or complicated cases, ventilatory support may be required.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency are associated with chronic pancreatitis and result from repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis leading to the destruction of acinar and islet cells. The exocrine pancreas produces digestive enzymes, the absence of which leads to malnutrition (e.g., cachexia, muscle wasting), weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and frequent, loose, foul-smelling, sometimes oily stools (steatorrhea). The endocrine pancreas produces insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin. The loss of endogenous insulin leads to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, with symptoms including polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia. The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic insufficiency is through clinical history, imaging, and biopsy. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is treated with oral pancreatic enzyme replacement, and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus caused by the loss of pancreatic insulin requires insulin replacement. Any modifiable inciting causes of pancreatitis (e.g., gallstones, alcohol abuse, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia) should be mitigated to delay disease progression and preserve remaining native pancreatic function. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F.

Classically, these tumors occur at the cerebellopontine angle of the brain stem and are associated with neurofibromatosis. They may exert mass effect on cranial nerves within their proximity or invade the nerves from which they arise, often the facial nerve, vestibulocochlear nerve, or adjacent nerves. Facial nerve involvement manifests as facial asymmetry caused by loss of skeletal muscle innervation, and occasionally presents with diminished taste perception involving the ipsilateral anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Vestibulocochlear nerve palsy can present with diminished hearing or tinnitus (cochlear branch) on the ipsilateral side, and vertigo or ataxia may occur (vestibular branch) because of impaired proprioception from loss of input from the ipsilateral vestibule.

A hypermetabolic state ensues with signs and symptoms including agitation, diaphoresis, hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, and muscle rigidity. Complications include hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis. MH is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and can present similarly to neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Renal artery stenosis is a cause of secondary hypertension related to abnormal stimulation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus from low afferent blood flow leading to excessive production of renin and angiotensin. The reduced afferent blood flow can also result in progressive renal atrophy. Secondary hypertension should be considered in new-onset or treatment-resistant hypertension, or in patients with predisposing features such as known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (e.g., coronary artery disease). There are two main causes of renal artery stenosis: fibromuscular dysplasia and atherosclerosis. In younger patients, fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause, while older patients develop renal artery stenosis more commonly from atherosclerosis. Diagnosis is established with renal artery Doppler ultrasonography or magnetic resonance angiography, which can quantify the degree of renal artery stenosis and renal atrophy. Treatment involves angioplasty or stenting of the stenosed renal artery to improve flow. ACE inhibitors can be considered for unilateral stenosis but can lead to acute kidney injury in the setting of bilateral renal artery stenosis.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Mitral stenosis is classically heard as an opening snap, followed by a diastolic rumble, loudest over the cardiac apex and radiating to the axilla. Mitral stenosis occurs because of calcification and fibrosis of the mitral valve. Impaired excursion of the valve leaflets results in increased left atrial filling pressures and impaired diastolic filling of the left ventricle. The resulting elevation in left atrial pressure can result in left atrial enlargement and potential pulmonary edema. The fixed obstruction to blood flow may manifest with signs of heart failure such as shortness of breath, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and impaired exercise tolerance. Chronic rheumatic disease is a key risk factor for the development of the condition. Treatment is through medical optimization followed by surgical valve replacement if severe.",

Atrial septal defect (",

Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (",

It is characterized by the presence of non-caseating granulomas on histology. On diagnostic imaging, patients often present with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, with or without bilateral upper lobe predominant interstitial infiltrates depending on the stage of the patient's disease. The clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic, to mild shortness of breath and cough, to diffuse granulomatous infiltration of multiple organ systems resulting in dysfunction. The diagnosis is presumed based on clinical history and imaging features, although tissue sampling, most commonly from involved lymph nodes, is required to definitively diagnose a patient. Treatment typically requires corticosteroids. Untreated chronic disease can progress to pulmonary fibrosis and restrictive lung physiology.",

Superficial burns (first-degree) do not involve layers deep to the epidermis and are characterized by erythema and pain, without blistering or loss of sensation. Partial thickness (second-degree) burns involve the epidermis and a portion of the dermis; they classically present with blistering, sloughing, severe pain, and erythema. Full thickness (third-degree) burns involve the epidermis and the full dermis, and are often accompanied by an insensate, charred, or leathery appearance. When calculating burned body surface area, only partial thickness and full thickness burns are counted. Superficial burns are not considered significant regarding fluid balance and resuscitation or the need for surgical intervention, as the stratum basalis and stem cells within hair follicles are preserved. In a superficial burn, the epidermis can regenerate from these unaffected sources of stem cells, whereas grafting may be required for deeper burns harming the cells responsible for tissue repair and regeneration.

Condyloma acuminatum and verrucous carcinoma are both associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). Warts and verrucous carcinoma can appear on the penis, vagina, vulva, and/or anal canal, and patients with HIV are prone to severe condyloma lesions in these regions.

The most common location of penile cancer is the glans penis. Squamous cell carcinoma can range in presentation from a small area of induration to a large ulcerating, infiltrative lesion. Differential considerations for an ulcerative penile lesion also include primary syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum, and chancroid.

This derangement in native microbiota presents an opportunity for competition-free proliferation of C. difficile, which produces toxins that result in dysfunction of the brush border and a subsequent secretory diarrhea. C. difficile infections are associated with the presence of pseudomembranes that appear as patchy regions of white mucosa on colonoscopy. The severity of C. difficile colitis can vary, ranging from watery diarrhea without constitutional symptoms in mild cases to toxic megacolon, colonic ischemia, and severe sepsis in fulminant cases. Treatment includes oral or rectal vancomycin, intravenous metronidazole, fidaxomicin, or colectomy depending on the severity of the patient's presentation.",

Tachycardia is a sign of hypovolemia, which must be attributed to hemorrhagic shock at this stage of workup. Given the patient's otherwise unremarkable physical examination outside of his left humeral fracture, direct pressure should be applied to the scalp wound, and intravascular volume loss should be replaced with 0.9% saline, followed by an emergent blood transfusion if hemodynamic instability results.",

The patient has a history of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair as a child, although she exhibits a holosystolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border, which suggests the continued presence of a VSD. VSD results in a left-to-right shunt, which increases pulmonary blood flow. This leads to remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature and resultant smooth muscle hypertrophy. In turn, concentric narrowing of the pulmonary arterioles occurs, which results in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension. If severe and progressive enough, this can cause increased right ventricular pressures and associated myocardial hypertrophy, which subsequently results in reversal of the shunt, presenting with shortness of breath and cyanosis. The patient's elevated pulmonary artery and right-heart pressures increase her risk for right-sided heart failure explaining her lower extremity edema, and for atrial fibrillation explaining her irregularly irregular tachyarrhythmia.",

Perforation can result from traumatic injury, erosion of an ulcer or gastritis through the muscularis and adventitia, malignant invasion, or necrosis or infarction of a segment of bowel, and presents with symptoms of peritonitis. Peritonitis classically presents as acute, severe abdominal pain which may rapidly progress to sepsis and shock. Patients typically demonstrate unstable vital signs such as fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. Examination discloses a guarded and rigid abdomen, which is often \"board-like\". Due to translocation of intraluminal contents into the peritoneal space, fulminant sepsis can ensue. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (e.g. aspirin and ibuprofen) is a key risk factor for the development of peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, and should raise suspicion for a perforated viscus in the setting of an acutely peritonitic patient. These medications inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which plays a critical role in the maintenance of the gastric mucosal barrier by counterbalancing the erosive effects of stomach acid through the synthesis of bicarbonate and mucus.

Pulmonary artery catheterization indicates a decreased cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, with an increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Hypovolemic shock occurs secondary to significant reductions in a patient's intravascular volume most commonly related to hemorrhage, dehydration, or gastrointestinal losses, which results in decreased stroke volume and cardiac output. This, in turn, results in arteriolar vasoconstriction to increase SVR in an attempt to maintain mean arterial pressure. If progressive and severe enough, the body is unable to further compensate, which leads to the development of hypotension and inadequate organ perfusion {shock).",

Cardiac output increases to compensate for low SVR in the early stages of distributive shock. If the inciting state is not appropriately treated, further decompensation can occur, resulting in progressive hypotension and insufficient perfusion with associated end-organ damage.

On physical examination, a pneumothorax presents as unilateral diminished breath sounds with hyperresonance to percussion. Obstruction of venous return results in jugular venous distention, and shifting of mediastinal structures results in contralateral tracheal deviation.

It is a potential complication of pneumonia, especially in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mechanical ventilation, or immunosuppression. ARDS is characterized by respiratory failure with bilateral diffuse interstitial and airspace opacities from underlying diffuse alveolar damage and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. ARDS is associated with aspiration, pneumonia, trauma, sepsis, and shock. Mechanical ventilation is often required in the management of ARDS because of hypoxia and hypoventilation. Further, polymicrobial flora on bronchial washings raises concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The most common organisms in the setting of VAP are gram-negative rods (e.g., Klebsiel/a species, Pseudomonas species), anaerobes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Given the virulence of the possible underlying infectious organisms, the development of a new cavitary lesion is likely secondary to the formation of a lung abscess.

The management of a human bite wound includes extensive cleaning with an antiseptic solution and debridement of the wound, followed by the application of a sterile dressing to the open wound to maintain cleanliness of the wound site. Because of the increased risk for infection from a human bite, especially from Eikenella corrodens, the wound is often left open as this reduces the risk for the development of infection. As well, any puncture wound that already demonstrates infection or is older than 6 to 12 hours should generally not be closed. Prophylactic antibiotics should be administered, specifically amoxicillin-clavulanate or ampicillin-sulbactam as these provide coverage for E. corrodens.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cholangiocarcinoma, a malignancy of the bile ducts, characteristically presents late in its course with signs of biliary tree obstruction, including abdominal discomfort, weight loss, nausea, jaundice, and pruritus. Patients may report dark urine or light, pale stools. Many persons have no risk factors; however, those with a history of cirrhosis, sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis B or C, liver fluke infection, and ulcerative colitis may be at increased risk. Diagnosis occurs through imaging of the abdomen with CT scan or MRI, which may disclose a variety of findings from bile duct wall thickening, a focal mass, or only dilation of bile ducts proximal to the presumed lesion location. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) allows for the potential direct visualization of the lesion location, bile duct scrapings or biopsy for definitive diagnosis, and stenting of any associated occlusion. Laboratory analysis typically discloses obstructive (direct) hyperbilirubinemia and increased alkaline phosphatase activity. Treatment includes surgical resection and chemotherapy; however, the condition is often late-stage or terminal at the time of diagnosis. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Measurement of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration (Choice A) is sometimes increased in cholangiocarcinoma; however, it is nonspecific and is also increased in colorectal carcinoma along with other various malignancies. It may be followed during treatment to assess treatment response but does not have a specific role in diagnosis. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA scan) (Choice C) evaluates the patency of the hepatobiliary tree and gallbladder. It is useful in cases of suspected acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, or biliary obstruction with indeterminate ultrasonography findings. It does not permit tissue sampling such as biopsy or therapeutic interventions such as stenting. Liver biopsy (Choice D) is useful in the diagnosis of conditions such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, though cholangiocarcinoma is generally small and confined to the biliary tree. These features may result in false negative liver biopsy results and should prompt targeted sampling via ERCP. Exploratory laparotomy (Choice E) involves the surgical evaluation of the peritoneal cavity and is commonly employed in the diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma, bowel obstruction, peritonitis, and undifferentiated cases of an acute abdomen. It does not have an immediate role in the diagnosis or management of cholangiocarcinoma. r \" , r-- r ,",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Osteoarthritis is a noninflammatory arthropathy that occurs secondary to deterioration of articular cartilage. It typically occurs in older persons and may affect any joint. It is commonly associated with the fingers and wrists because of repetitive use, and the hips and knees because of chronic weight bearing, especially in persons with obesity. It is not associated with infectious or inflammatory symptoms and is generally insidious in onset. Patients typically report chronic pain in a joint that is worse with movement or exertion and is improved with rest, often with limited range of motion in a joint because of underlying joint space narrowing and associated pain. Fever, chills, erythema over a joint, traumatic injury, or extra-articular manifestations (e.g., rashes, uveitis, urethritis) suggest an alternate, inflammatory, or infectious cause. Imaging may demonstrate osteophytosis, subchondral cystic or sclerotic changes, and space narrowing of joints. Arthrocentesis typically demonstrates leukocytes of less than 2,000/mm 3 with no additional abnormalities. Treatment includes rest, physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular injections (e.g., cortisone), and joint replacement surgery for severe or refractory cases.",

In contrast to stable BAT, hemodynamically unstable BAT is evaluated first with focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) followed by an exploratory laparotomy if positive, whereas stable BAT permits time for more thorough evaluation and the additional detail offered in a CT scan. Patients should also receive intravenous fluids, pain control, and supportive care as needed. There should be close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamics, as decompensation may occur rapidly if bleeding is present or continues unabated.",

Vital signs may show hypertension or hypotension depending on cardiac function. If left heart failure ensues, signs and symptoms of pulmonary edema such as shortness of breath, cough, tachypnea, hypoxia, and crackles may be present. If right heart failure occurs, peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, ascites, jugular venous distention, and hypotension may be present. ST-segment elevations in leads 11, Ill, and a VF suggest an inferior wall myocardial infarction, which classically occurs from occlusion of the right coronary artery. Cardiogenic shock is a potential complication. In cardiogenic shock, there is severe dysfunction of the cardiac myocytes, resulting in markedly decreased contractility. Pulmonary artery catheterization typically demonstrates decreased cardiac output and increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure because of the underlying systolic cardiac dysfunction. Systemic vascular resistance is commonly increased as a physiologic attempt to maintain mean arterial pressure in the setting of reduced cardiac output and peripheral perfusion.",

Vital signs may disclose bradypnea and low arterial oxygen saturation.

Arterial blood gas analysis may disclose an acidic pH with increases in both Pco and HCO along with low arterial oxygen -, 2 3 tension.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Congenital heart disease is often subdivided into cyanotic and noncyanotic types depending on the direction of blood shunting. Structural heart defects that result in flow of deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary to systemic circulations (a right-to-left shunt) classically present with cyanosis, respiratory distress, hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension generally within 1 to 7 days after birth. Common culprit lesions include truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great vessels, tricuspid atresia, tetralogy of Fallo!, and total anomalous pulmonary venous return. These lesions require the concomitant presence of a left-to-right shunt (patent ductus arteriosus) to allow for a degree of blood oxygenation. Without a left-to-right shunt, a complete absence of oxygenation can occur because of the separated circulatory systems, which is incompatible with life.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Acute cholecystitis occurs secondary to obstruction of the cystic duct from a lodged gallstone, which results in subsequent inflammation of the gallbladder wall. It classically presents with fever, abdominal pain, and tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant, often in a patient with a history of gallstones. It is occasionally preceded by symptoms of biliary colic. It is more commonly seen in women with obesity in their 40s to 50s, especially those having a history of multi parity. Risk factors include gallstones, biliary sludge, or conditions that slow or delay gastric emptying or reduce contractility of the gallbladder such as pregnancy or total parenteral nutrition. Diagnosis is through clinical history, physical examination, and ultrasonography, which may disclose pericholecystic fluid, a dilated gallbladder, gallbladder wall thickening and hyperemia, the presence of gallstones, and a sonographic Murphy sign (pain with compression directly over the gallbladder). Treatment involves surgical resection of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy). lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, E, and F. Abruptio placentae (Choice A) presents with vaginal bleeding, severe uterine pain, and tetanic contractions, typically in the third trimester. It commonly results from lower abdominal trauma, smoking, or cocaine use. Acute appendicitis (Choice B) presents with periumbilical pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant, fever, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and leukocytosis. r \" , r-- r ,",

Bowel obstruction can occur because of locally invasive disease or because of peritoneal carcinomatosis, which is often a common presenting diagnosis. Spread of the malignancy throughout the peritoneum results in bowel and omental implants, which on gross surgical examination is described as \"caking.\" The resultant mechanical distortion, tethering, and compression of bowel leads to obstruction in a similar mechanism to postoperative adhesions and strictures. Any incidental ovarian enlargement or cyst in a woman over age 50 years should be investigated for malignancy with imaging and potentially biopsy.

In severe cases, chronic circulatory insufficiency can result in skin breakdown, leading to the development of open ulcers, classically along the medial aspect of the ankle. Venous insufficiency often results from deep venous thrombosis with resultant damage to the valves. When the thrombus resolves, the residual vessel may be dysfunctional from damage to the valve leaflets, valve annulus, or increased diameter of the native vessel. This prevents the vessel from functioning effectively and results in stagnant or retrograde venous flow secondary to gravity. Treatment includes wound care for the ulcer and measures to reverse the venous insufficiency such as optimizing venous return, diuresis, and improving circulatory function by optimizing cardiac, vascular, and kidney function.",

Classically, these tumors occur at the cerebellopontine angle of the brain stem and are associated with neurofibromatosis. They may exert mass effect on cranial nerves within their proximity or invade the nerves from which they arise, often the facial nerve, vestibulocochlear nerve, or adjacent nerves. Facial nerve involvement manifests as facial asymmetry because of loss of skeletal muscle innervation and occasionally presents with diminished taste perception involving the ipsilateral anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Vestibulocochlear nerve palsy can present with diminished hearing or tinnitus (cochlear branch) on the ipsilateral side, and vertigo or ataxia may occur (vestibular branch) because of impaired proprioception from loss of input from the ipsilateral vestibule. In cases of larger masses, disruption of brain stem tracts and increased intracranial pressure can result.",

A spontaneous primary pneumothorax can occur in a tall, thin, young person because of the rupture of a pulmonary bleb, classically in a young athlete and often during physical exertion. Small pneumothoraces can be managed with serial examinations and repeat chest x-rays to confirm resolution. When the lesion is larger than 20 to 30% of the hemithoracic volume, a chest tube should be placed to evacuate the pneumothorax and reinflate the lung to prevent the development of a persistent or permanent pneumothorax.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Osteoporosis occurs because of the loss of bone mineral density. The condition results from the interplay of three possible mechanisms: failure to achieve peak bone density, increased bone resorption, and decreased new bone formation. The condition is often asymptomatic until a traumatic injury results in a fracture, most commonly involving the hip, distal radius, or vertebrae. Classically, serum calcium, vitamin D, and magnesium concentrations are within the reference ranges; however, calcium handling in the bloodstream is key in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Hypocalcemia and hypovitaminosis D both lead to increased concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which results in increased osteoclast activity and bone resorption. Low concentrations of vitamin D are also associated with increased concentrations of PTH even when serum calcium is within the reference range. The diagnosis of osteoporosis is made based on DEXA scan once the bone density falls below 2.5 standard deviations of the mean for a young adult. Treatment includes correcting any modifiable risk factors, supplementing calcium and vitamin D, weight-bearing exercise therapy, and the use of osteoclast inhibitors (e.g., bisphosphonates).",

Many people will develop some degree of valve stenosis because of chronic inflammation with resultant calcification and fibrosis over time, with the aortic valve most commonly affected. Structural abnormalities of the valve, such as a bicuspid aortic valve, alter the biomechanics of valve opening and closing, which increases the likelihood of earlier calcification and resultant stenosis because of increased mechanical trauma. Congenital bicuspid aortic valve classically presents with early signs and symptoms of aortic stenosis and left-sided diastolic heart failure. Patients may report fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, diminished exercise tolerance, or syncope with exertion. Examination findings include a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border, and pulsus parvus et tardus (weak and delayed) may be noted on examination of peripheral pulses.

As demand falls during rest, the pain typically improves. Peripheral vascular disease is common among older men who smoke cigarettes and have a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia. Active exercise improves collateral vascularization, which allows for improved arterial oxygenated blood flow to the skeletal musculature and is the best initial step in treatment along with the mitigation of risk factors.

If there is clinical concern for SBP, the ascites fluid should be sampled through a paracentesis. Laboratory analysis of the ascitic fluid should include Gram stain, culture, and cell counts. A total leukocyte count of greater than 1000/mm 3 or greater than 250 neutrophils/mm 3 is generally diagnostic of SBP since culture results are variably positive.

The loss of acinar and islet parenchyma can be further exacerbated if a distal pancreatectomy is performed to control symptoms or manage complications of chronic pancreatitis. The exocrine pancreas produces digestive enzymes, the absence of which leads to malnutrition (e.g., cachexia, muscle wasting), weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and frequent, loose, foul-smelling, sometimes oily stools (steatorrhea). The diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency is through clinical history, imaging, and biopsy. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is treated with oral pancreatic enzyme replacement such as pancrelipase. Endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, if present, typically results in diabetes mellitus, which requires insulin replacement therapy. Any modifiable inciting causes of pancreatitis (e.g., gallstones, alcohol use disorder, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia) should be mitigated to delay disease progression and preserve remaining native pancreatic function.",

Small volume, simple fluid aspiration may be resorbed by the lung without any consequence of infection, irritation, or compromised gas exchange. In other cases, large volume aspiration may sufficiently impair gas exchange resulting in refractory hypoxia. The aspiration of acidic stomach contents may cause aspiration pneumonitis, whereas the aspiration of gastrointestinal flora and additional bacteria can cause aspiration pneumonia. The volume of aspirate is the strongest predictor of complications from aspiration, especially in the case of pneumonia, as the bacterial inoculum may overwhelm the native ability of the pulmonary alveolar defenses (macrophages, cilia, mucus) to prevent colonization, replication, and infection. Aspiration pneumonia classically presents with cough productive of foul-smelling sputum, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, and rhonchi on examination. Imaging classically shows an infiltrate in the most dependent segments of lung at the time of aspiration (e.g., in the superior segment of the inferior lobe when supine or lower lobes when erect), and treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics with sufficient coverage of oral flora, gram-negative rods, and anaerobes.",

Pericarditis classically presents as substernal chest pain, which is often pleuritic, worsens when lying down, and improves with leaning forward. It can occur in patients with inflammatory, infectious, or malignant conditions, such as viral infection, systemic lupus erythematosus, tuberculosis, and lymphoma, and can present as a complication of myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery. On examination, pericarditis demonstrates a diastolic friction rub, described as a harsh sound heard in diastole. The condition is diagnosed clinically and supported by increased inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. If not treated, pericarditis can lead to the development of pericardia! effusions, which, if large and quickly accumulating, can result in cardiac tamponade. An echocardiography should be performed to assess for the presence of a pericardia! effusion, which may require pericardiocentesis for drainage if large. Treatment includes anti-inflammatory medications, such as indomethacin, glucocorticoids, and/or colchicine. Conditions with a similar presentation, such as acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and aortic dissection, should also be ruled out.",

Physical examination may demonstrate excessive lacrimation, conjunctiva! erythema, decreased visual acuity, and increased light sensitivity. Fluorescein staining is indicated to assess for a corneal injury. Fluorescein passes over intact corneal tissue but is trapped in epithelial defects, which are easily visualized under a blacklight.

Risk factors for cholesterol embolization syndrome include trauma and interventional procedures that increase the risk for damage and dislodgement of atherosclerotic plaques, such as cardiac catheterization (e.g., damage to atherosclerotic plaques of the thoracic and abdominal aorta via a femoral artery approach).

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Corticosteroid therapy is the most appropriate treatment for a patient presenting with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) related to an underlying intracranial metastasis. The most common intracranial tumor is a metastatic lesion from an extracranial primary malignancy. The cerebellum is a common location for metastases, along with the gray-white matter junction of the supratentorial brain. Cerebellar metastases typically present as a headache and symptoms of cerebellar dysfunction, such as gait disturbance, limb discoordination, and dizziness. Metastases to the brain are associated with significant vasogenic edema. This edema can lead to abnormal enlargement of the cerebellum, which can impress upon the fourth ventricle and foramina of Magendie and Luschka. This can result in the development of obstructive hydrocephalus and increased ICP. Increased ICP presents as nonspecific symptoms of altered mental status, stupor, vomiting, seizures, and blurry vison. Papilledema refers to optic disc swelling seen on funduscopic examination of the eyes and is secondary to increased intracranial pressure. The administration of intravenous corticosteroids assists in reducing metastasis-associated vasogenic edema, limiting its mass effect and risk for the development of obstructive hydrocephalus and increased ICP.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Hypercalcemic crisis secondary to malignancy-associated hypercalcemia is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Acute hypercalcemia can present as a broad spectrum of symptoms and can be life threatening because of its effect on neuronal conduction, the cardiac action potential, kidney function, and volume status. It commonly presents as constipation, lethargy, weakness, and altered mental status. It can result in a short QT interval and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, leading to significant dehydration. A potential cause of severe hypercalcemic crisis is malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, which can be secondary to the humoral secretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma of the lung) or from direct invasion and lytic lesions of the bone from osseous metastases (e.g., breast cancer). Treatment emphasizes preventing end-stage kidney disease, promoting the renal excretion of calcium, reducing intestinal absorption of calcium, inhibiting bony destruction, and, if necessary, renal replacement therapy with dialysis. Treatment therefore begins with the infusion of normal saline to restore intravascular volume and dilute serum calcium, followed by the administration of osteoclast inhibitors such as bisphosphonates, and possibly calcitonin if further medications are required to decrease calcium concentrations.",

This abnormal activation and consumption results in progressively decreasing platelet counts, which typically nadir at >50% of their initial level.

These lead to a constellation of symptoms such as dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, hallucinations, delirium, ataxia, flushed skin, visual disturbances (cycloplegia), and sedation. Muscarinic type 3 receptors stimulate the contraction of smooth muscle in the urinary bladder wall. The anticholinergic adverse effects of diphenhydramine antagonize this action, resulting in impaired urinary bladder contractility, which subsequently leads to urinary retention.

Transfusion reactions can range from mild (e.g., itching, fever, mild rash) to severe (e.g., hemolysis, anaphylaxis). Most reactions are mild and may not necessitate the cessation of the transfusion. An acute febrile transfusion reaction (febrile, non hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR)) occurs because of the presence of preformed antibodies to donor leukocyte antigens and occasionally from cytokines in the plasma component of the transfused sample. FNHTR ranges from mild (mild fever, minimal additional symptoms) to severe (high fevers, rigors, myalgias, nausea). Treatment consists of pausing the transfusion to rule out ABO incompatibility through performing a direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test. The Coombs test entails testing for the presence of antibodies on the recipient's red blood cells (ABO incompatibility), and if positive, would confirm an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR) instead of an FNHTR. Distinguishing the two is important as AHTR can be life threatening, leading to massive hemolysis, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.",

Because of their location below the dentate line with somatic nervous system innervation, they result in significant pain during defecation and are associated with bright red blood on toilet paper. A common initiating factor for the development of an anal fissure is a history of chronic constipation resulting in the passage of hard stool, which can cause trauma to the anal mucosa. While some anal fissures self-resolve, persistent anal fissures can result in anal spasms and increased sphincter tone on examination. Initial management for persistent, symptomatic anal fissures includes administration of stool softeners, Sitz bath, topical analgesics, and topical vasodilators.

Normal urine output ranges between 0.5 and 2 cc/kg/hr. Prerenal azotemia refers to an acute kidney injury secondary to insufficient renal blood flow in states of hypoperfusion, which results in a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This can occur in the setting of hypovolemia and hypotension, including transient intraoperative hypotension. In response to the decreased renal blood flow, renin and angiotensin are upregulated, which stimulates increased absorption of sodium in the proximal convoluted tubule. The decreased GFR results in decreased tubular flow rate, which consequently leads to increased urea nitrogen reabsorption and reduced urine volume because of the increased resorption of solute and water. Treatment of prerenal azotemia requires treatment of the underlying cause of reduced renal blood flow, often requiring the administration of resuscitative intravenous fluids.

A patient with a history of malignancy, surgery, and immobility is at a substantially increased risk for the development of a DVT.

Fibromuscular dysplasia is a noninflammatory and nonatherosclerotic angiopathy of medium-sized arteries (e.g., renal, carotid) that results in multifocal fibrous and muscular thickening of the arterial wall, which can lead to a bead-like appearance and resultant stenosis. Renal artery stenosis is a cause of secondary hypertension because of abnormal stimulation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus from low afferent blood flow leading to excessive production of renin and angiotensin. The reduced afferent blood flow can result in progressive renal atrophy. Secondary hypertension should be considered in new-onset or treatment-resistant hypertension, or in younger, otherwise healthy patients. There are two main causes of renal artery stenosis: fibromuscular dysplasia and atherosclerosis. In younger patients, fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause, while older patients develop renal artery stenosis more commonly from atherosclerosis. Diagnosis is established with renal artery Doppler ultrasonography or magnetic resonance angiography, which are able to quantify the degree of renal artery stenosis and renal atrophy. Treatment involves angioplasty or stenting of the stenosed renal artery to improve flow. ACE inhibitors can also be considered for unilateral stenosis but can lead to acute renal failure in the setting of significant bilateral renal artery stenosis.",

This results in vertebrobasilar insufficiency, which can manifest as dizziness, vertigo, imbalance, light-headedness, and hearing disturbances. Most patients demonstrate differential blood pressures between the affected and unaffected upper extremities, with a greater than 15-mm Hg differential between the two.

It typically presents as acute onset of pain out of proportion to examination findings, erythema, and paresthesia which progresses to anesthesia at a site of prior trauma or surgery. Risk factors include the severity of inoculation and underlying chronic systemic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, liver failure, or kidney failure. As the bacterial infection spreads along the deep fascial planes, bullae with or without crepitus may develop. The extent of infection is often difficult to assess by examination alone.

Ascaris lumbricoides, also known as a giant roundworm, is commonly transmitted through fecal-oral routes via ova within feces. After ingestion, the intestinal larvae can infiltrate the wall of the small bowel, and penetrate into blood vessels, where they may migrate to the lungs. Once in the lungs, they are coughed up and swallowed again. Final development into adult worms occurs within the small bowel, where they continue to produce eggs. Complications include bowel obstruction at the ileocecal valve and retrograde migration within the biliary tree. This can result in subsequent biliary obstruction, which leads to jaundice and direct hyperbilirubinemia. Treatment includes administration of antihelminthics (e.g., albendazole, ivermectin).",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cecal malignancy refers to colon cancer of the cecum, which is an often-insidious malignancy that can present with chronic blood loss resulting in iron deficiency anemia, and stool that tests positive for occult blood. Test of the stool for occult blood is sensitive but not specific for many malignant, vascular, infectious, and inflammatory gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, including but not limited to colorectal carcinoma (CRC), arteriovenous malformation, polyposis, diverticulosis, inflammatory bowel disease, gastritis, and peptic ulcer disease. In the setting of unexplained microcytic anemia in persons over age 50 years, males, or postmenopausal female patients, CRC should be considered. If a lower GI tract source of bleeding such as CRC is suspected, a colonoscopy is indicated. This allows visualization, biopsy, excision, or cautery of any suspicious lesions, which can be both diagnostic and therapeutic depending on the size of the lesion.",

While hemorrhoids can result in bright red blood per rectum, bleeding is generally mild and unlikely to cause microcytic anemia. Meckel diverticulum (",

The differential diagnosis for a tender adnexal mass resulting in acute pain includes ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, tuba-ovarian abscess, appendicitis, and a ruptured ovarian cyst. Given that the mass is located within the ovary, is exquisitely tender, and the pregnancy test is negative, the potential for ovarian torsion is high. Ovarian torsion occurs secondary to hypermobility of the ovary or the presence of a large adnexal mass. Patients typically present with acute lower abdominal and pelvic pain, which may be lateralized to the side of torsion, along with nausea and vomiting. Evaluation of ovarian torsion includes visualization with ultrasonography, which can assess the size, features, underlying mass, and blood flow of the ovary.
