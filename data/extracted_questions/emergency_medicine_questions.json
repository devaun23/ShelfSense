CO has a significantly higher affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen and binds to available hemoglobin. On binding, CO displaces oxygen from heme, limiting total carrying capacity, and results in maintenance of hemoglobin in the relaxed form, with loss of cooperative binding. This results in systemic hypoxemia and tissue hypoxia. Risk factors include prolonged exposure to motor vehicle exhaust (as in operating an outboard motor for an extended period of time); exposure to byproducts of burning charcoal, gas, or petroleum (especially in poorly ventilated areas); or exposure to paint thinners that contain methylene chloride (which is metabolized to CO). Symptoms include headache, light-headedness, nausea, and altered mental status. Patients typically have a paradoxically normal peripheral oxygen saturation and may display tachycardia, tachypnea, and cherry-red skin on physical examination in the late stages of CO poisoning. Acute management involves removing the patient from the exposure and treatment with 100% supplemental oxygen to displace CO from hemoglobin. Severe cases and high-risk patients demonstrating any degree of neurologic deficit or significant end-organ dysfunction should be treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Alcohol increases the central nervous system activity of y-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. Abrupt discontinuation of alcohol therefore leads to sympathetic (excitatory) excess. Uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal typically presents with tremors, anxiety, restlessness, headache, nausea, and diaphoresis, which can occur hours after the cessation of alcohol use. If left untreated, alcohol withdrawal can also be complicated by seizures and alcoholic hallucinosis (auditory or visual hallucinations). Delirium tremens, the most concerning and life-threatening complication of alcohol withdrawal, involves severe confusion and disorientation, fluctuations in consciousness, agitation, visual hallucinations, and autonomic instability (fluctuations in pulse and blood pressure with hyperthermia). Alcohol withdrawal is managed supportively with benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam) to address agitation and prevent the symptoms of withdrawal, along with fluids, nutritional supplementation, and frequent assessment including vital sign checks.",

Unexpected submersion in water leads to reflexive breath holding followed by air hunger and an eventual reflexive inspiratory effort. This leads to hypoxia through either aspiration of water or laryngospasm when water contacts the vocal cords. Prolonged hypoxemia leads to end-organ dysfunction including acidosis, hypoxic brain injury, and cardiac arrhythmias. Exposure of the alveoli to water can lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which appears on chest imaging as noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. ARDS can develop immediate ly after injury or slowly over many hours and can be rapidly fatal. In general, all nonfatal drowning victims with any degree of hypoxia, respiratory distress, or infiltrates on imaging should be hospitalized to monitor for the evidence of the development of ARDS and complications of drowning.",

Appendicea l obstruction leads to bacterial proliferation within the lumen and wall of the appendix, eventually leading to inflammation, infection, appendicea l necrosis, and perforation. Acute appendicitis typically presents with abdomina l pain that is often periumbilical at onset and which may later migrate to the right lower quadrant, along with leukocytosis and tenderness to palpation. Patients often develop fever and may also experience nausea and anorexia. Other genitourinary, vascular, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestina l mimics should be excluded. The diagnosis can be confirmed with CT scan, MRI, or ultrasonography. Appendectomy is indicated to prevent appendicea l rupture, which can lead to peritonitis or an intra-abdominal abscess.

The patient's increased concentrations of lipase and amylase in the setting of typical epigastric pain are most consistent with pancreatitis, and the concurrent presence of direct hyperbilirubinemia, transaminitis, and fever are concerning for concomitant early cholangitis. While there are numerous causes of pancreatitis, the most common causes include gallstones and heavy alcohol consumption. Gallstones that pass out of the gallbladder through the cystic duct eventually reach the common bile duct (CBD). The main pancreatic duct also connects to the CBD, which is a conduit for pancreatic enzymes to reach the duodenum. If gallstones become lodged in the distal aspect of the CBD, obstruction of pancreatic flow can lead to release and activation of pancreatic enzymes within the pancreas, which causes substantial inflammation and pain. Additiona lly, as the flow of bile toward the duodenum is obstructed, patients can develop hyperbilirubinemia and increased liver enzymes.

Human bites that penetrate the skin are at high risk for becoming infected with oral and skin flora, including Eikenel/a, Fusobacterium , Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. Viral pathogens such as herpes simplex virus and HIV can also be transmitted. Superficial infection presents as cellulitis with tenderness, warmth, and erythema, but deeper infection can occur, which may present with pain with passive movement, crepitus, and systemic illness. This patient does not yet demonstrate any signs of infection. In this case, wound management including irrigation, control of bleeding, and removal of any visible debris should be performed. The wounds should not be closed because this increases the risk for infection. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is appropriate, particularly in patients with wounds on the hands or face, if the patient is immunocompromised, or if the patient has a prosthetic valve, prosthetic joint, or vascular graft. The preferred empiric antibiotic is amoxicillin-clavulanate, which covers both oral and skin flora.",

Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs as a result of the relative state of starvation created by absent insulin signaling. Vital signs may show tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension caused by severe dehydration. Laboratory analysis typically demonstrates increased serum glucose and ketones, metabolic acidosis, and a high anion gap caused by the accumu lation of unmeasured anions in serum. Metabolic acidosis is accompanied by a decreased bicarbonate concentration in the serum because bicarbonate is consumed in the neutralization of increased acidic molecules (hydrogen molecules) in the blood.

Organophosphates are present in pesticides and patients can be exposed through absorption, inhalation, or ingestion. Symptoms of cholinergic toxicity secondary to organophosphate poisoning included diarrhea, vomiting, excessive urination, lethargy, and altered mental status. Physical examination may demonstrate bradycardia, hypotension, miosis, increased salivation or tearing, diaphoresis, and evidence of bronchospasm. Muscle weakness and paralysis may be present, in addition to cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory failure. Long-term complications include neurocognitive deficits. Treatment consists of decontamination (eg, removal of contaminated clothing), fluid resuscitation, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation if indicated, and administration of atropine. Atropine acts by competitive ly binding the acetylcholine receptors, which prevents the cholinergic effects of acetylcholine. Pralidoxime is used in the treatment of organophosphate poisoning and exerts its effects at the neuromuscular junction, where atropine is ineffective, by reactivating cholinesterase. Benzodiazepines may be administered if affected patients are convulsing.",

It often causes symptoms early in pregnancy because of the restricted area for fetal development and commonly presents with lower abdominal or pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding. Physical examination may disclose adnexal tenderness on the side of implantation. ~-hCG is produced by the placenta, is undetectable in the serum of nonpregnant patients, and doubles approximately every 48 hours during an early normal pregnancy. ~-hCG concentrations do not increase as expected in ectopic pregnancy, often lagging the normal expected doubling. An ectopic pregnancy is not viable. Treatment of an ectopic pregnancy can be medical, using methotrexate for small, early pregnancies, but may require salpingectomy or evacuation with laparoscopy for larger pregnancies or in cases of medical treatment failure.

Other symptoms, though not present in this case, can include proximal muscle weakness, diarrhea, menstrual abnorma lities, and insomnia.

Dysfunction of the brainstem can also present with cranial nerve dysfunction, dizziness, vertigo, and gait instability, symptoms that the patient had been experiencing prior to this acute episode. The Babinski sign, or extensor plantar response, is an upper motor neuron sign that indicates damage to the corticospinal tract, a descending motor tract located in the central nervous system. The Babinski sign is present when the lateral part of the plantar surface of the foot is firmly stroked and the hallux extends (moves rostrally) while the other toes abduct. The doll's eye (oculocephalic) maneuver refers to the brainstem reflex that occurs in normal adults in which the examiner moves the patient's head, and the eyes move in the opposite direction to hold the patient's gaze on an object. In a negative oculocephalic reflex, the patient's eyes remain midline, which indicates severe brainstem dysfunction. The cause of brainstem dysfunction in this patient is likely brainstem ischemia, which is often not disclosed on CT scan when acute. MRI is more sensitive for diagnosis.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Tension pneumothorax can be a complication of a penetrating thoracic trauma and occurs when air is able to enter the pleural space but is prevented from exiting. Increasing amounts of trapped air in the pleural space compress the lung parenchyma, creating an inability for the lung to expand and causing it to collapse. As the pneumothorax progresses and continues to increase in size, it can result in tracheal and/or mediastinal deviation away from the affected hemithorax. It can result in decreased venous return to the heart, which manifests with hypotension and obstructive shock. Tension pneumothorax is characterized by absent breath sounds and hyperresonance to percussion caused by the increased air in the intrathoracic space displacing normal lung parenchyma. In cases of acute tension pneumothorax, evacuating the accumulated air via needle decompression and aspiration permits expansion of the lung and eliminates tension on the mediastinal structures, resolving obstructive shock. Immediate needle decompression is followed by tube thoracostomy, which promotes expansion of the lung, prevents reaccumulation of air, and promotes healing of the pleural defect.",

Risk factors include adolescence, multiple sexual partners, and not using barrier contraception such as condoms. Vaginitis typically presents with mucopurulent discharge and pruritus. Cervicitis presents with similar discharge, but also with an erythematous, friable cervix and cervical motion tenderness on examination. When infection spreads to the fallopian tubes and ovaries, PIO with purulent and foul smelling cervical discharge, uterine and adnexal tenderness, and systemic symptoms such as fever can result. If left untreated, PIO can become complicated by a tuba-ovarian abscess, as in this patient, presenting with focal tenderness and a possible fluctuant mass on physical examination. The diagnosis can be confirmed with pelvic ultrasonography, which would demonstrate a complex, heterogeneous, multilocular mass within the adnexa.

Arterial injuries sustained during a posterior knee dislocation can include dissection, rupture, thrombosis, and intramural hematoma; pseudoaneurysms can also occur. Imaging, including arteriography or CT or MR angiography, is useful to investigate the presence of underlying arterial injuries and to facilitate operative repair planning.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Anaphylactic shock, a severe type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction, presents following exposure to an allergen. It is caused by widespread lgE-mediated mast cell degranulation and is characterized by histaminergic responses within multiple organ systems leading to flushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and vasodilation, which can lead to airway obstruction and circulatory collapse. It is generally acute in onset following a specific exposure and generally does not self-resolve. If not managed promptly, death can occur from hypoxia and/or distributive shock. Anaphylaxis is a form of distributive shock, which is characterized by a primary reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). This reduction in SVR is secondary to lgE-mediated histamine and cytokine release. Cardiac output increases to compensate for low SVR in the early stages of distributive shock. If the inciting state is not appropriate ly treated, further decompensation can occur, resulting in progressive hypotension and insufficient perfusion with associated end-organ damage. After the administration of epinephrine, fluid resuscitation should be initiated to increase intravascular volume to support adequate organ perfusion.",

These patients present with fevers, malaise, polyarthritis or oligoarthritis, tenosynovitis, and vesiculopustular dermatitis.

Other risk factors include lack of acclimatization, obesity, dehydration, and poor physical fitness. During exertion, the body is able to dissipate heat by increasing blood flow to skin and producing sweat to facilitate evaporative cooling. However, when ambient temperature is increased and humidity is high, these mechanisms are less effective at dissipating heat, potentially resulting in heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Heat exhaustion is characterized by exercise intolerance, increased core body temperature, and the absence of neurologic disturbances (eg, altered mental status, confusion, or seizure). Heat stroke is characterized by hyperthermia, altered mental status or neurologic deficits, and variable physical signs and symptoms depending on severity. In this case, this patient was running a marathon and was susceptible to overheating from the environment. His examination shows tachycardia, hypotension, and warm, flushed skin. Laboratory work-up may disclose hypernatremia, hyperchloremia, hyperkalemia, along with increased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and creatine kinase concentrations. Management of heat-related illness involves removing the individual from the heat, removing excess clothing, and initiating cooling measures such as immersion in cool water or evaporative cooling.",

Asymptomatic patients should be observed in the emergency department and admitted to the hospital if any clinical deterioration occurs. Symptomatic patients or patients who have continued hypoxia should be admitted to the hospital and be monitored until symptoms and hypoxia resolve.

The diagnosis is made definitively by analysis of the joint aspirate, which will demonstrate needle-shaped crystals that are negatively birefringent under polarized light. Aside from synovial fluid crystal analysis, it is also important to perform a cell count and culture on the joint aspirate to rule out infection as septic arthritis and acute gout attacks can exist simultaneously in the same patient and in the same joint.

This patient has developed focal neurologic deficits that resolved after 30 minutes, qualifying as a TIA. TIA can be induced by either an embolus arising from a proximal site or from temporarily decreased blood flow to a watershed area in the brain. A \"low-flow\" TIA typically lasts minutes while an embolic TIA lasts longer, as in this case. An embolic ischemic stroke involves an event in which a clot breaks off and travels to the brain, occluding blood flow within a cerebral artery. Emboli most commonly originate from proximal vessels, such as the internal carotid artery, or from an atrial thrombus. If the embolus successfully undergoes physiologic thrombolysis, blood flow is restored to the affected area and reverses the clinical symptoms. After a TIA, measures for the prevention of an ischemic stroke should be enacted. In this case, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to administer for secondary prophylaxis of a cerebral infarction is aspirin. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are also stroke risk factors which should be optimized, though in this case the patient is already receiving treatment for these comorbidities.",

Patients with splenic injuries may have left upper quadrant tenderness, peritonitis from blood products irritating the peritoneum, or referred pain to the left shoulder secondary to diaphragmatic irritation. In hemodynamically stable patients, minor splenic injuries may be treated nonoperatively with observation and reassessment.

It can also result in decreased venous return to the heart, which manifests with hypotension and obstructive shock. Tension pneumothorax is characterized by absent breath sounds and hyperresonance to percussion as a result of the increased air in the pleural space displacing normal lung parenchyma along with hemodynamic instability. In cases of acute tension pneumothorax, evacuating the accumulated air via needle decompression and aspiration permits expansion of the lung and eliminates tension on the mediastinum.

Regardless of the cause, all patients should receive chronic anticoagulant medications such as warfarin, low molecular weight heparin, or one of the direct oral anticoagulant medications. Additionally, underlying risk factors for VTE should be addressed. This patient's cigarette use increases her risk for VTE, but the use of oral contraceptives, especially in a patient who smokes cigarettes, confers a substantially higher risk for VTE.

Partial-thickness burns are typically painful to temperature, air, and touch, and take 1 to 3 weeks to heal. A full thickness (third-degree) burn may be white, gray, or black, and have a leathery or charred appearance. It does not blanch with pressure and only deep pressure causes pain.

In this patient with evidence of an upper extremity arteriovenous graft presenting in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, there is high suspicion for hyperkalemia as a cause of cardiac arrest as a result of underlying kidney injury. Patients with end-stage kidney disease requiring dialysis are prone to electrolyte abnormalities, especially hyperkalemia. Severe hyperkalemia leads to reduced myocardial excitability resulting in repolarization abnormalities, conduction dysfunction, heart block, and bradycardia. These abnormalities can manifest on an ECG with peaked T waves, P-R interval prolongation, loss of P waves, and if severe, widened ORS complexes, bradycardia, and cardiac arrest. Hyperkalemia resulting in ECG changes or cardiac arrest requires the emergent administration of calcium gluconate or calcium chloride to induce cardiac cell membrane stabilization. Further treatment after calcium may involve insulin and glucose, ~-adrenergic agonists, or bicarbonate to shift potassium into cells, loop diuretics to facilitate the urinary excretion of potassium, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate to promote binding of potassium within the lumen of the gut.

Both ascites and esophageal varices are consequences of portal venous hypertension, which occurs as a result of obstruction of flow through the sinusoids within the liver.

This patient continues to have signs of hemorrhagic shock despite adequate fluid resuscitation; thus, he should also receive pRBCs. Additionally, patients with bleeding varices should receive intravenous antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone, an octreotide infusion, and a proton pump inhibitor.

This patient is lethargic with absent protective airway reflexes (eg, gag reflex), which puts her at an increased risk for aspiration. Aspiration occurs when gastric or oropharyngeal contents enter the airway, which can lead to pneumonitis or pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia presents with cough, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, fever, and abnormal breath sounds. Chest x-ray will exhibit patchy infiltrates, most commonly in the right lower lobe if the patient was upright while the aspiration occurred, or the posterior, gravity-dependent portions of the lungs if the patient was supine.

Within hours of the last drink, alcoholic hallucinosis (auditory or visual hallucinations without confusion or autonomic instability) and seizures (as a result of cortical hyperactivity) can occur. Delirium tremens, the most concerning and life-threatening complication of alcohol withdrawal, involves severe confusion and disorientation, fluctuations in consciousness, agitation, visual hallucinations, and autonomic instability (fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure with hyperthermia). As a result of their activating effect on GABA receptors, benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, are effective in reducing the psychomotor hyperactivity associated with alcohol withdrawal. Long-acting benzodiazepines are preferred because they reduce the risk for recurrent seizures.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The ECG shows torsades de pointes, a dangerous form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia characterized by a sinusoidal pattern with cyclic variation in amplitude. Episodes are typically brief and resolve spontaneously, but patients are at risk for progressing to ventricular fibrillation , hemodynamic collapse, and death. Patients with prolongation of the Q-T interval (which may be familial or acquired, such as with adverse effects of several medications) ,are susceptible to developing torsades de pointes. Medications that are associated with torsades de pointes include class IA and Ill antijarrhythmic agents, macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics , methadone, antipsychotics , antidepressants , antiemetics, and diuretics such as furosemide . Hypomagnesemia , hypokalemia , and hypocalcemia also increase risk. The patient presentation typically involves palpitations, syncope, lightheadedness , tachycardia , and pallor. Immediate treatment requires intravenous magnesium administration , which inhibits calcium influx into myocardial cells and suppresses early afterdepolarizations to interrupt the arrhythmia. Any potential QT-prolonging medications should be discontinued , and consultation with a cardiologist or electrophysiologist is recommended to determine if long-term pharmacologic therapy or an implantable cardiac device is indicated. Hemodynamically unstable patients generally require cardioversion (which may not be possible given the polymorphic nature of the arrhythmia) or defibrillation . Incorrect Answers : A, B, C, D, and E. Amiodarone (Choice A) is an antiarrhythmic agent that is commonly used to treat ventricular arrhythmias ; however, it causes QT prolongation and can worsen torsades de pointes. Amiodarone should be avoided in this patient. Atropine (Choice B) is an anticholinergic agent used in the treatment of bradyarrhythmias because of its muscarinic inhibition . Atropine increases heart rate and shortens the Q-T interval but is not recommended in the treatment of torsades de pointes . Magnesium administration is standard therapy. Calcium gluconate (Choice C) may be considered in addition to magnesium in the treatment of torsades de pointes, as hypocalcemia increases the risk for the arrhythmia as well. Magnesium should be administered first. Epinephrine (Choice D) is used in the treatment of numerous cardiac arrhythmias as a result of its positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. Increasing the heart rate shortens the Q-T interval and may provide a benefit; however, magnesium has been demonstrated as the most effective initial therapy. Lidocaine (Choice E) may be considered as an adjunct to magnesium for persistent torsades de pointes as it does not prolong the Q-T interval. Magnesium should be administered first.",
