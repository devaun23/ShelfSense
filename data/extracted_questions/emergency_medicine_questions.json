Hypertensive emergency is defined as a blood pressure greater than 180/120 mm Hg with evidence of end-organ damage (e g, pulmonary edema and acute heart failure). The patient's severe hypertension causes an acute increase in afterload that the heart is unable to overcome, and impaired forward flow of blood leads to congestion and increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary vascular system and the systemic venous system. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema presents in patients with shortness of breath, tachypnea, hypoxia, and audible rales on examination. Intravenous antihypertensive medications should be used for the treatment of hypertensive emergency to appropriate ly decrease blood pressure and limit progression of end-organ damage. In acute heart failure and pulmonary edema, the blood pressure should be rapidly decreased using nitroglycerin, a potent vasodilator, to lower mean arterial pressure by decreasing vascular resistance. Nitroglycerin, a venodilator, can also be used to shift fluid into capacitance vessels and lower preload. Positive pressure ventilation can also decrease alveolar and interstitial edema and drive fluid back into circulation.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia and has an increased prevalence in patients with a history of immunocompromise, such as HIV, multiple myeloma, or following solid organ transplant. Typical signs and symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia include fever, chills, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, dyspnea, productive cough, rales, decreased breath sounds, increased tactile fremitus, and pleuritic chest pain. Plain film x-ray commonly discloses a lobar pneumonia or, less commonly, bronchopneumonia. The diagnosis may be supported by sputum culture with the presence of gram-positive diplococci in chains. Patients with evidence of unstable vital signs should undergo blood culture to evaluate for possible bacteremia. Therapy includes support of vitals as well as empiric antibiotic therapy either with a third-generation cephalosporin and macrolide or with fluoroquinolones. While pneumococcal pneumonia remains the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia, prophylaxis with pneumococcal vaccines has led to a decline in its incidence over recent decades.",

        "A": "Adenovirus is a cause of viral pneumonia and may lead to severe infections in patients who are immunocomprom ised. However, this patient's fever and the presence of gram-positive, diplococci on sputum culture are suggestive of pneumococcal pneumonia.",
        "B": "Coxsackievirus is an RNA enterovirus that is transmitted via oral secretions or feces. Coxsackievirus group A causes hand, foot, and mouth disease and herpangina. Coxsackievirus group B may cause myocarditis and pericarditis. Haemophi/us influenza (Choice C) is an encapsulated gram-negative bacillus that is a common cause of pneumonia in adults. However, it is less common in comparison to S. pneumoniae (a gram-positive coccus). Klebsiel/a pneumoniae (Choice D) is a gram-negative bacillus that classically causes hospital-acquired pneumonia. It is less frequently a cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Legionel/a pneumophi/a (Choice E) is a gram-negat ive bacillus that is transmitted through aerosols from water sources and causes atypical pneumonia that appears as diffuse, patchy alveolar and interstitial opacities or as a lobar consolidation. It can be associated with hyponatremia. Moraxel/a catarrha/is (Choice F) is a gram-negative diplococcus that is a rare cause of pneumonia in immunocomprom ised adults. It typically causes bacterial rhinosinusitis and has been implicated in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults. Pneumocystis jirovecii (Choice H) is a yeast-like fungus which causes pneumocys tis pneumonia in patients who are immunocomprom ised. Chest imaging typically shows diffuse, bilateral perihilar infiltrates. Pneumocyst is pneumonia is less common than pneumococcal pneumonia, including among immunocompromised patients. Staphylococca l (Choice I) pneumonia typically presents as a lobar pneumonia that occurs in elderly adults following a preceding viral infection."

ECG evidence of hyperkalemia includes flattening of the P-waves, lengthening of the PR interval, widening of the ORS complex, and the presence of tall, peaked T-waves. Acute management in order of priority involves stabilization of the myocardium with calcium gluconate or calcium chloride, shifting serum potassium into the intracellular compartment (using insulin and dextrose, sodium bicarbonate, or ~ adrenergic agonists), and removal of potassium from the body (using diuretics, oral potassium binders, or 7 hemodialysis). After the patient is stabilized, evaluation should be directed toward identifying the cause of the hyperkalemia. In this patient with a recent hospitalization for pneumonia, dementia, underlying chronic kidney injury, loop diuretic use, and recent history of emesis, the most likely explanation is acute on chronic renal failure caused by hypovolemia exacerbated by diuretic use. steps include laboratory studies, urinalysis, imaging, and admission for further management.",

CO has a significantly higher affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen and binds to available hemoglobin. On binding, CO displaces oxygen from heme, limiting total carrying capacity, and results in maintenance of hemoglobin in the relaxed form, with loss of cooperative binding. This results in systemic hypoxemia and tissue hypoxia. Risk factors include prolonged exposure to motor vehicle exhaust (as in operating an outboard motor for an extended period of time); exposure to byproducts of burning charcoal, gas, or petroleum (especially in poorly ventilated areas); or exposure to paint thinners that contain methylene chloride (which is metabolized to CO). Symptoms include headache, light-headedness, nausea, and altered mental status. Patients typically have a paradoxically normal peripheral oxygen saturation and may display tachycardia, tachypnea, and cherry-red skin on physical examination in the late stages of CO poisoning. Acute management involves removing the patient from the exposure and treatment with 100% supplemental oxygen to displace CO from hemoglobin. Severe cases and high-risk patients demonstrating any degree of neurologic deficit or significant end-organ dysfunction should be treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

Administration of ipecac (Choice A) is not recommended for treatment of CO poisoning. While historically ipecac was used to treat numerous types of oral toxin ingestions, it is no longer widely recommended because of limited established benefit and potential risk of harm. Similarly, gastric lavage (Choice C) was a common gastric decontamination procedure for oral toxic ingestions that is no longer widely recommended. Administration of 0.9% saline and vitamin B (thiamine) (Choice B) would be an appropriate treatment for acute alcohol toxicity or 1 withdrawal complicated by volume depletion, with thiamine given to prevent or treat Wernicke encephalopathy.

Naloxone therapy (Choice F) generally provides potential strong benefit without risk of harm in treating encephalopathy caused by suspected opioid overdose.

Unexpected submersion in water leads to reflexive breath holding followed by air hunger and an eventual reflexive inspiratory effort. This leads to hypoxia through either aspiration of water or laryngospasm when water contacts the vocal cords. Prolonged hypoxemia leads to end-organ dysfunction including acidosis, hypoxic brain injury, and cardiac arrhythmias. Exposure of the alveoli to water can lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which appears on chest imaging as noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. ARDS can develop immediate ly after injury or slowly over many hours and can be rapidly fatal. In general, all nonfatal drowning victims with any degree of hypoxia, respiratory distress, or infiltrates on imaging should be hospitalized to monitor for the evidence of the development of ARDS and complications of drowning.",

Admission to the hospital for observation is the most appropriate management for this young girl who recently suffered a nonfatal drowning incident. Unexpected submersion in water leads to reflexive breath holding followed by air hunger and an eventual reflexive inspiratory effort. This leads to hypoxia through either aspiration of water or laryngospasm when water contacts the vocal cords. Prolonged hypoxemia leads to end-organ dysfunction including acidosis, hypoxic brain injury, and cardiac arrhythmias. Exposure of the alveoli to water can lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which appears on chest imaging as noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. ARDS can develop immediately after injury or slowly over many hours and can be rapidly fatal. In general, all nonfatal drowning victims with any degree of hypoxia, respiratory distress, or infiltrates on imaging should be hospitalized to monitor for the evidence of the development of ARDS and complications of drowning. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Antibiotic therapy (Choice B) is not indicated in this patient. Antibiotics are reserved for patients with presumed or proven bacterial infections, but drowning does not necessarily predispose to the development of bacterial infection. Corticosteroid therapy (Choice C) is not useful in the management of drowning victims.

Diuretic therapy (Choice D) is used to treat patients with hypervolemia that develops as a result of renal disease or decompensated heart failure, but diuretics are not useful in the treatment of drowning victims. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (Choice E) can be a useful adjunct in patients with both cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, but this patient is maintaining reasonable oxygenation, so this intervention would be premature."

If gallstones become lodged in the distal aspect of the CBD, obstruction of pancreatic flow can lead to release and activation of pancreatic enzymes within the pancreas, which causes substantial inflammation and pain. Additiona lly, as the flow of bile toward the duodenum is obstructed, patients can develop hyperbilirubinemia and increased liver enzymes. This can predispose to cholangitis, which is an ascending bacterial infection of the biliary tree. Treatment for gallstone pancreatitis is either cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography or, in most cases, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to retrieve the obstructing gallstone. While awaiting procedural intervention, patients should be treated with intravenous fluids, narcotic pain medications, and antibiotics if there is suspicion for biliary tree infection.",

        "A": "induced pancreatitis is a common cause of pancreatitis, but this patient with a history of hyperlipidemia, increased bilirubin, and increased liver-associated enzymes is more likely to have gallstone pancreatitis. Increased direct bilirubin would not be classic if alcohol was the primary cause.",

It does not result in increased liver-associated enzymes. Drug-induced hepatic dysfunction (Choice D) can either be idiosyncratic or dose-dependent, as in the case of acetaminophen overdose. It may present with increased concentrations of ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin, but it requires a compatible history of drug exposure, which is absent in this case. Duodenal ulceration (Choice E) may present with epigastric pain and may cause gastrointestinal bleeding with subsequent melena, but it does not cause an increase in liver enzymes."

Diabetic ketoacidosis (OKA) presents with fatigue, polyuria, polydipsia, shortness of breath or tachypnea, and diffuse abdominal discomfort, most commonly in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. It is caused by the accumulation of serum ketones such as p hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone in the setting of insulin deficiency.

Potassium concentration may be decreased (Choice C), normal, or increased (Choice F) on presentation. Patients with OKA often have a total body deficit of potassium as a result of osmotic diuresis in the setting of hyperglycemia. However, the serum concentration may remain normal or even high since the lack of insulin and metabolic acidosis cause potassium to move out of the cells and into the serum. Increased bicarbonate (Choice D) is seen in metabolic alkalosis, which can occur with volume depletion secondary to persistent nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, OKA causes an increase in the amount of acid in the blood, which is buffered by bicarbonate. Subsequent metabolic acidosis occurs with decreased bicarbonate."

Hypertensive emergency is defined as a blood pressure greater than 180/120 mm Hg with evidence of end-organ damage (e g, pulmonary edema and acute heart failure). The patient's severe hypertension causes an acute increase in afterload that the heart is unable to overcome, and impaired forward flow of blood leads to congestion and increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary vascular system and the systemic venous system. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema presents in patients with shortness of breath, tachypnea, hypoxia, and audible rales on examination. Intravenous antihypertensive medications should be used for the treatment of hypertensive emergency to appropriate ly decrease blood pressure and limit progression of end-organ damage. In acute heart failure and pulmonary edema, the blood pressure should be rapidly decreased using nitroglycerin, a potent vasodilator, to lower mean arterial pressure by decreasing vascular resistance.

While age over 45 years is associated with suicide attempts, this patient's age of 29 years is not (Choice A). Family and spousal support, which this patient has, is a strongly protective factor for suicide. Thus, family support (Choice C) is not a risk factor for this patient attempting suicide.

Pediatric patients typically present with lethargy. Signs of volume depletion include tachycardia, hypotension, a sunken anterior fontane lle, and dry mucous membranes.

CT scan of the abdomen is most likely to confirm the ureterolithiasis in this patient with right flank pain and hematuria. Risk factors for the development of nephrolithiasis include diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, male sex, and prior gastric bypass. Calcium containing stones, including calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate, are the most common varieties, although kidney stones may also be composed of cystine, struvite, and uric acid. The typical presentation of kidney stones that have become lodged in the ureter (ureterolithiasis) includes severe, intermittent, sharp flank pain with either gross or microscopic hematuria, leukocytosis, and occasionally evidence of a concomitant urinary tract infection. While abdominal, plain x-rays were traditionally used for diagnosis, urate stones are radiolucent, and given the availability and sensitivity of advanced imaging, a noncontrast CT scan of the abdomen is now the preferred imaging modality for definitive diagnosis. Acute management depends on the size and location of the stone, in addition to complicating factors such as abnormal anatomy or the concurrent presence of a urinary tract infection. Staghorn calculi, which occur commonly in the setting of infection with urease-producing bacteria, often must be surgically removed. Additionally, stones larger than 6 mm often require intervention because they are unlikely to pass on their own. For smaller stones in clinically stable patients, treatment is hydration and pain control. Medications such as tamsulosin may be used to augment stone passage. At times, urine should be strained to assess the passage of the stone, though data and practice patterns on this are mixed.",

Measurement of serum uric acid concentration (Choice D) is not necessary in this patient because he does not have evidence of a gout flare. While some kidney stones are composed of uric acid, serum uric acid measurement does not reliably predict the composition of any kidney stones. Urine culture (Choice E) should be performed in patients who are suspected to have a urinary tract infection in addition to ureterolithiasis. Laboratory findings consistent with diagnosis of a urinary tract infection include pyuria, positive nitrites, or positive leukocyte esterase on urinalysis."

Complete blood count (Choice A) can be done as part of routine blood work prior to possible surgery or hospitalization, but it would not change or assist in the management. Exploratory laparotomy (Choice B) can be done for obstruction that does not autoreduce with bowel rest and decompression but would not be appropriate prior to insertion of a nasogastric tube for management. Surgery is also indicated in cases of perforation or necrosis, but this patient does not show any signs of peritonitis or guarding suggestive of these complications. Intravenous antibiotic therapy (Choice D) would be indicated in cases of bowel perforation, sepsis, or necrosis, but this patient does not show any signs of peritonitis or guarding suggestive of these complications. Antibiotics are not routinely indicated in the management of bowel obstruction. Manual disimpaction (Choice E) can be helpful in cases of constipation and obstructing rectal stool burden.

Cerebral vasculitis (Choice B) is rare and can present with neurologic deficits, headache, seizures, or coma. Symptoms of dizziness, neck pain, cranial nerve deficits, ataxia, and dysarthria are more consistent with vertebral artery dissection. Lacunar infarcts (Choice C) are ischemic strokes that occur in small penetrating arteries, most commonly involving the basal ganglia or internal capsule. Internal capsule lacunar infarcts can present with purely motor deficits that cause contralateral hemiparesis, ataxic hemiparesis (contralateral hemiparesis plus ataxia), or clumsy hand-dysarthria (hand weakness plus articulation difficulties). Occasionally, sensory symptoms can accompany motor weakness. Ruptured aneurysm (Choice D) typically leads to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhages present acutely with severe headache and an absence of focal neurologic deficits because the hemorrhage occurs in the subarachnoid space rather than the brain parenchyma."

Oral ingestion of hard candies (Choice D) is an effective way of increasing blood sugar in a patient with intact mental status. However, this patient is delirious and cannot be given anything by mouth because of concerns about his ability to protect his airway if an aspiration or emetic event occurs. He may not be able to follow the command to swallow, and his cough and gag reflexes may be impaired, both of which increase the risk for aspirating the hard candy and irreversibly occluding his airway. Rectal administration of dextrose (Choice E) is a less timely and reliable method of increasing blood sugar. This patient is experiencing severe neurologic manifestations of hypoglycemia, and the quickest method of increasing his blood sugar is necessary."

Tension pneumothorax can be a complication of a penetrating thoracic trauma and occurs when air is able to enter the pleural space but is prevented from exiting. Increasing amounts of trapped air in the pleural space compress the lung parenchyma, creating an inability for the lung to expand and causing it to collapse. As the pneumothorax progresses and continues to increase in size, it can result in tracheal and/or mediastinal deviation away from the affected hemithorax.

Pericardia! window (Choice C) or pericardiocentesis (Choice D) would be indicated in cases of traumatic pericardia! effusion causing cardiac tamponade. Tamponade presents with hypotension, jugular venous distention, distant heart sounds, and pulsus paradoxus. This patient has decreased breath sounds, tachypnea, and hypoxia, making pneumothorax more likely.",
        "E": "Thoracotomy is an invasive procedure that allows for control of thoracic hemorrhage, decompression of cardiac tamponade, or management of aortic or pulmonary hemorrhage. It can be indicated in cases of penetrating trauma with hemodynamic instability despite appropriate management, or of pulselessness and receiving CPR for less than 15 minutes with witnessed previous signs of life. This patient's hemodynamic instability is likely caused by tension pneumothorax, which should be managed by needle decompression and tube thoracostomy, not thoracotomy. Tube thoracostomy (Choice F) typically follows needle decompression, which is an emergent and rapid maneuver that can help temporize the patient in preparation for eventual tube thoracostomy. Tube thoracostomy should be done under sterile conditions and requires several minutes."

CT angiography of the chest is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis. This young patient with new-onset exertional dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, recent lower extremity swelling suggestive of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and tachycardia most likely has a pulmonary embolism (PE). The Wells score for pulmonary embolism can be a helpful tool in determining the likelihood of a DVT or PE and directs the most appropriate diagnostic step, which can include a o-dimer or image-based test such as CT angiography. In patients with a low pretest probability, a negative o-dimer effectively rules out a PE. In those with a higher score, the most appropriate diagnostic test is CT angiography, which is a CT scan with iodinated contrast timed to evaluate the pulmonary arteries. Pregnant patients or those with contraindications to CT scans or contrast can undergo ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scans, although this imaging modality is not universally available. Pulmonary emboli can be found in the main pulmonary, segmental, or subsegmenta l arteries and appear as filling defects on imaging. For patients without evidence of cardiogenic shock, treatment is systemic anticoagulation, which can be accomplished with warfarin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or with direct oral anticoagulants. ECG findings in PE include sinus tachycardia, right-axis deviation, right bundle branch block, an S-wave in lead I, a Q wave in lead Ill, and an inverted T wave in lead Ill. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E. Measurement of serum troponin I (Choice A) is unlikely to lead to a diagnosis in this case. Troponin is a cardiac biomarker that can occasionally be increased in cases of pulmonary embolism with associated right heart strain or failure, but it does not confirm the diagnosis. D-dimer assay (Choice C) is used to rule out PE in patients with a low to intermediate probability of PE, but this patient has a high probability of PE and should proceed directly to CT angiography. Echocardiography (Choice D) is indicated if there is evidence of shock secondary to right ventricular failure. Large pulmonary emboli can cause obstructive shock and right ventricular failure, which is demonstrated on echocardiography by right ventricular dilation or hypokinesis or bowing of the interventricu lar septum into the left ventricle. Measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (Choice E) is appropriate for patients who are suspected to have acute decompensated heart failure. BNP is released by the ventricles in response to stretch from increased volume or pressure. It may be increased in cases of PE with shock but is also nonspecific. Educational Objective: A pulmonary embolism often presents with findings suggestive of a recent DVT (unilateral leg swelling) along with chest pain, tachycardia, and occasional ly hypoxia. In patients with a high probability of PE, CT angiography is the most appropriate",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Infection is the most likely precipitant of this patient's acute chest syndrome (ACS). ACS occurs as a result of vaso-occlusion within the pulmonary microvasculature and is diagnosed in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who present with a new pulmonary infiltrate in the setting of fever or other new respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, increased work of breathing, tachypnea, or hypoxemia. While ACS is a distinct clinical syndrome, it is common ly precipitated by another illness such as bacterial or viral pneumonia, asthma exacerbation with hypoventilation, or fat emboli, among others. It is both impractical and nearly impossible to distinguish ACS from pneumonia, so nearly all patients receive antibiotics to treat bacterial pneumonia. Additional ly, the use of either simple transfusion or exchange transfusion may be a component of therapy. Further treatment involves maintaining normoxia with supplemental oxygen or the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, judicious use of fluids, and aggressive pulmonary hygiene measures, including the use of an incentive spirometer. Patients with a pulmonary embolism should be placed on full anticoagulation while all others should receive prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism. Pain should be managed aggressive ly.",

        "B": "Embolism should always be considered in patients with ACS, but thrombi found within the pulmonary vasculature are more likely to form in situ rather than represent emboli from the veins of the lower extremities. Fat emboli may also precipitate ACS, but these are not visualized on CT angiography and there is no treatment other than supportive care.",
        "C": "Hypoventilation can precipitate ACS, but this patient's prodrome with cough and shortness of breath is more suggestive of pneumonia than hypoventilation in isolation. Similarly, thrombosis (Choice E) can precipitate ACS, but this patient's symptoms prior to presentation suggest an alternative cause."

Fever, tachypnea, and leukocytosis also support a diagnosis of sepsis. Hypotension, cool mottled extremities, and end-organ dysfunction indicate the presence of shock. The patient's risk for developing a severe infection is increased by use of daily corticosteroids and a tumor necrosis factor a blocker for her rheumatoid arthritis.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Cardiac tamponade can result in obstructive shock caused by compression of the cardiac chambers. Findings suggestive of cardiac tamponade include hypotension, jugular venous distention, distant heart sounds, pulsus paradoxus, and a low-voltage ECG. Gastrointestinal bleeding (Choice B) may result in hemorrhagic/hypovolemic shock, and the use of ibuprofen and corticosteroids are risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding. The presence of fever and leukocytosis and the absence of any reported history of bleeding make sepsis a more likely diagnosis. The initial management for both septic and hemorrhagic shock is fluid resuscitation. Non-ST-elevation myocardia l infarction (Choice C) may lead to cardiogenic shock because of impaired ventricular contraction and inadequate cardiac output. Typical findings include jugular venous distention, pulmonary crackles, and a weak pulse. Measuring troponin concentration and performing echocardiography can support or refute the diagnosis. Pulmonary embolism (Choice D) can cause an obstructive form of shock in which the right ventricle fails as it contracts against greater resistance in the pulmonary vasculature. This results in diminished left heart return and cardiac output, with the consequence of decreased perfusion to the right ventricle and further loss of function."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Abscess formation occurs in the settin Correct Answer: B. Abscess formation occurs in the setting of an acute inflammatory response to an infectious organism, resulting in an organized collection of pus, necrotic cellular debris, and infectious organisms present on histology. A bacterial abscess presents with cutaneous erythema, warmth, fluctuance, and purulent drainage, often following inoculation from an injury such as a spider bite, puncture, or abrasion. Systemic symptoms including fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis are often but not necessarily present. Most commonly, abscess formation is acute and results from a bacterial infection of the skin. The two most common pathogens to cause bacterial infections of the skin are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A). S. aureus is most likely to cause a bacterial abscess. It also causes impetigo, erysipelas, and folliculitis. Other less common organisms include C/ostridium perfringens, which infects an open wound and causes necrotizing fasciitis, Enterococcus faecalis, which causes nosocomial infections, and Pasteurel/a multocida, which causes infections secondary to cat and dog bites. Incision and drainage would be appropriate therapy for an abscess to release pus and debris to control the source of the infection. While the patient may also require oral antibiotics, without incision and drainage the oral antibiotics will not effectively penetrate the abscess wall; thus, it is the most important next step.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Biopsy of the affected area is not necessary in this case. Skin biopsy is performed when there is diagnostic uncertainty about the cause of a skin finding and can be used to obtain a sample for culture. It involves surgically removing a small core of skin and submitting it for pathology in formalin or for tissue culture in sterile saline. In this case, the diagnosis of bacterial abscess is clinical, and a biopsy is unnecessary. Oral antibiotic therapy (Choice C) is inadequate in this case without appropriate surgical drainage of the bacterial abscess. While the patient may receive oral antibiotic therapy following incision and drainage, the bacterial source control provided by the surgical procedure is more critical than antibiotic therapy alone. Topical corticosteroid therapy (Choice D) is used to treat inflammatory processes of the skin including dermatitis, psoriasis, and lichen planus. While the presence of erythema around the abscess clearly indicates inflammation, treating this inflammation with topical corticosteroids without treating the underlying cause, a bacterial abscess, will be ineffective. X-ray of the right knee (Choice E) is not necessary in this case because there is no suggestion of bony involvement of the infection. X ray of the right knee will not provide any information about the soft tissue surrounding the abscess. Imaging is unnecessary in this case, but if x-ray evaluation of the soft tissue was necessary, an MRI would be more appropriate."

The presence of hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status indicate an acute shock state, and the patient requires emergent volume resuscitation. Isotonic crystalloid solutions are effective, inexpensive, and readily available in most medical settings. Incorrect Answer: A, B, C, and D. Urine toxicology screening (Choice A) does not take precedence over immediate fluid resuscitation. It may be considered as part of the evaluation for the underlying cause of the patient's fall and somnolence, and it could rule out toxic ingestions that may be contributing factors. CT scan of the head (Choice B) is not recommended prior to fluid resuscitation because the patient's condition is likely to deteriorate rapidly in the imaging suite if her shock is not addressed first. CT scan of the head may be considered after the patient is stabilized as part of the evaluation for her fall and somnolence. Administration of 5% dextrose (Choice C) is not recommended because it is a hypotonic solution (the dextrose component is readily taken up into cells) and water shifts out of the vasculature, rendering it less effective than isotonic crystalloids. Administration of 5% dextrose may be considered if it is the only fluid option available or as an adjunct to isotonic crystalloid solutions in the setting of hypoglycemia. Administration of insulin (Choice D) is not indicated at this time. The patient has a normal blood glucose concentration, and her somnolence and metabolic acidosis are better explained by sepsis and potential acute renal injury than by a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Upper endoscopy is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis in this patient with signs and symptoms of upper gastrointestina l bleeding (UGIB). Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is often separated into upper and lower GI bleeding. Patients with UGIB often present with dizziness or light-headedness, nausea, epigastric pain, and melena. Occasionally, as in the case of variceal bleeding, hematemesis may accompany these symptoms. Laboratory findings may show an increased blood urea nitrogen concentration, but the decrease in hemoglobin concentration often lags behind clinically significant bleeding. Treatment should initially focus on resuscitation with crystalloids and erythrocyte transfusion as needed. All patients are started on an intravenous proton pump inhibitor, and patients with cirrhosis and suspected variceal bleeding should receive octreotide and antibiotics. Major causes of UGIB aside from esophageal varices include Mallory-Weiss tear, peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, esophagitis, and angiodysplasia. Rare causes include Dieulafoy lesion, gastric antral vascular ectasia, and aortoenteric fistula. After patients have been stabilized, upper endoscopy should be performed both to determine the cause of bleeding and to intervene on any lesions that are amenable to treatment, such as bleeding ulcers or visibly bleeding blood vessels.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "CT scan of the abdomen is insensitive for evaluating the cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. Resuscitation followed by endoscopy should generally be performed first. If no cause of bleeding is identified, then CT angiography may be able to localize brisk bleeds that exist at locations distal to the duodenum.",
        "B": "Colonoscopy is the intervention of choice when patients are suspected of having a source of lower GI bleeding such as diverticulosis or angiodysplasia, which often presents with hematochezia rather than melena. Celiac angiography (Choice D) is not the correct answer. Angiography can be performed if there is suspicion of a brisk bleed at a site distal to the duodenum that cannot be reached by an endoscope. If a bleeding vessel is identified, embolization can be performed, but this should never be the first step in evaluation of GI bleeding. Exploratory operation (Choice E) is indicated in patients who develop perforated bowel. While this can occur in the setting of gastric or duodenal ulcers, it is rare, and patients often have peritoneal signs on examination and evidence of sepsis, which this patient lacks."

Simple and uncomplicated febrile seizures are generalized and defined as lasting less than 15 minutes and not recurring within a 24-hour period, whereas complex febrile seizures are focal, prolonged, and recurring. It is important to differentiate febrile seizures secondary to a viral illness from a bacterial central nervous system infection, which can also present with fever and seizure, but patients are typically ill-appearing and may have signs of meningismus. In patients with febrile seizures that have spontaneously resolved, active treatment with benzodiazepines is not necessary and the fever can be treated symptomatically with antipyretics (eg, acetaminophen). Most children who present with simple febrile seizures can be discharged safely as long as they have returned to baseline and parents are given anticipatory guidance and strict return precautions. Children with focal or prolonged seizures may require further observation, intervention, or diagnosis, especially if there is delayed recovery to baseline or a prolonged postictal phase.",

This patient presents with symptoms consistent with unstable angina, defined by angina symptoms that are new, occur at rest, or are worsening in severity. Unstable angina is a type of acute coronary syndrome, which requires urgent diagnostic workup including serial ECGs, troponin testing, cardiology consultation, and myocardial perfusion testing, stress testing, or cardiac catheterization. Nitroglycerin is a potent venodilator that decreases cardiac preload and myocardial oxygen demand, making it a first-line therapy in the treatment of angina pectoris along with aspirin, which inhibits platelet aggregation. Patients with unstable angina are stratified on the basis of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score, which assists in identifying the need for therapeutic anticoagulation and coronary angiography. In this patient with improving chest pain, a normal ECG, and serial troponin concentrations within the reference range, the most appropriate next step in management is urgent myocardial perfusion testing.",

Emergent cardiac catheterization (Choice B) would be appropriate in cases of acute myocardial infarction, which would present similarly with anginal chest pain but would have ECG changes showing ST-segment elevation and increased concentrations of serum troponin. This patient's diagnostic work-up shows no abnormalities, making acute myocardial infarction unlikely. This patient may require cardiac catheterization because his TIMI score is high; however, it (or a noninvasive stress test) should occur urgently within 3 days, as opposed to emergently.

In penetrating abdominal trauma, evaluation of the depth of the wound tract is quickly done to determine whether it has violated the peritoneum. Gunshot wounds are particularly high-ene rgy and can cause severe intra-abdomina l injury including hemorrhage and viscus perforation. Laparotomy of the abdomen is indicated for hemodynamically unstable patients (eg, tachycardia and hypotension) presenting after penetrating abdomina l trauma because it permiits the control of hemorrhage and the repair of identified injuries. In stable cases, imaging precedes surgical intervention.",

Contrast study of tracts can be used to evaluate patency and location of things like gastrostomy tubes, cholecystostomy tubes, and jejunostomy tubes. CT scan of the abdomen (Choice D) would be helpful in diagnosing other traumatic injuries such as liver or splenic lacerations, duodenal hematoma, bowel perforation, or retroperitoneal hematoma. However, for patients who are hemodynamically unstable, a CT scan may delay diagnosis and prompt management of intra-abdominal injuries. Intravenous pyelography (Choice E) involves the intravenous injection of radio-opaque contrast to visualize the renal collecting system, ureters, and bladder under fluoroscopy. This allows for the investigation of suspected urinary tract anatomic abnormalities, malignancies, and strictures.",

Peritoneal lavage (Choice H) is used for the evaluation of hemoperitoneum in abdominal injury. While it has mostly been replaced by evaluation with ultrasonography, CT scan, or laparoscopy, it may be useful in situations with equivocal results or in low-resource settings.

It is caused by widespread lgE-mediated mast cell degranulation and is characterized by histaminergic responses within multiple organ systems leading to flushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and vasodilation, which can lead to airway obstruction and circulatory collapse. It is generally acute in onset following a specific exposure and generally does not self-resolve. If not managed promptly, death can occur from hypoxia and/or distributive shock. Anaphylaxis is a form of distributive shock, which is characterized by a primary reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). This reduction in SVR is secondary to lgE-mediated histamine and cytokine release. Cardiac output increases to compensate for low SVR in the early stages of distributive shock. If the inciting state is not appropriate ly treated, further decompensation can occur, resulting in progressive hypotension and insufficient perfusion with associated end-organ damage.

Acute serum sickness (Choice A) is a type Ill (immune complex-mediated) hypersensitivity reaction in which antibodies to foreign proteins are produced and immune complexes deposit in membranes, leading to tissue damage. It typically presents with fever, urticaria, arthralgias, proteinuria, and lymphadenopathy 5 to 10 days after exposure. Anaphylaxis is typically an immediate and acute reaction. Cardiogenic shock (Choice C) can occur in diseases such as myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. In cardiogenic shock, there is severe dysfunction of the cardiac myocytes resulting in markedly decreased contractility, tachycardia, hypotension, and impaired end-organ perfusion (cool extremities and low urine output). Disseminated intravascular coagulation (Choice D) presents with bleeding, thrombocytopenia, increased prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times, decreased plasma fibrinogen concentration, and increased d-dimer and fibrin split product concentration. It can be caused by trauma, severe sepsis, and occasionally malignancy. It is unlikely to cause hypotension unless the patient is experiencing severe bleeding resulting in hemorrhagic shock or refractory sepsis. Septic shock (Choice E) is characterized by vasoplegia (impaired response of the vasculature to vasoconstricting stimuli) with markedly decreased systemic vascular resistance, which can cause hypotension and tachycardia. However, sepsis typically occurs because of an overwhelming bacterial infection, and this patient's immediate and acute symptoms are more likely caused by antigen exposure and anaphylaxis."

A 71-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her family because of a 1-day history of intermittent agitation and confusion. During the past 2 days, she has had a cough and has felt cold. She has hypertension, coronary artery disease, and Graves disease; she takes lisinopril, methimazole, and lovastatin. She has no known allergies. On arrival, she is oriented to person but not to place or time. Her temperature is 39.4 °C (103°F), pulse is 150/min and regular, respirations are 26/min, and blood pressure is 114/52 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. The skin is warm and moist to the touch. Cardiac examination shows no murmur or gallop. Rhonchi are heard in the right lung base. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Cranial nerves, motor function, sensation, and cerebellar function appear to be intact, but patient agitation prevents a detailed neurologic examination. Patellar reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. 'I 3. Item 1 of 2 In addition to x-ray of the chest, which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis? A) Blood culture B) Complete blood count with differential C) CT scan of the head D) Measureme nt of serum calcium and magnesium concentrations E) Thyroid function testing Correct Answer: E. Thyroid storm is a serious potential complication of hyperthyroidism. It typically occurs in a patient with a known diagnosis of hyperthyroidism following physiologic stress from surgery or trauma, or in the setting of infection, such as in this patient who presents with signs and symptoms of pneumonia. Signs and symptoms of thyroid storm include hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, diaphoresis, agitation, tremor, hyperreflexia, nausea, and diarrhea, and may progress to high-output heart failure, obtundation, seizure, or coma. The initial diagnosis of thyroid storm is made through a combination of clinical features and thyroid function testing, which shows increased serum concentrations of triiodothyronine (T and thyroxine (T and a decreased ) ), 3 4 concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Management requires supportive care, treatment of the underlying provocative stress, as well as intravenous corticosteroids, ~-adrenergic blockers, propylthiouracil, and potassium iodide. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Blood culture (Choice A) is an appropriate step for the diagnosis of bacteremia and sepsis. This patient's altered mental status, hyperreflexia, and known history of Graves disease is more concerning for thyroid storm Exam Section: Item 3-4 of 50 B) Complete blood count with differential C) CT scan of the head D) Measureme nt of serum calcium and magnesium concentrations E) Thyroid function testing Correct Answer: E.

Signs and symptoms of thyroid storm include hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, diaphoresis, agitation, tremor, hyperreflexia, nausea, and diarrhea, and may progress to high-output heart failure, obtundation, seizure, or coma. The initial diagnosis of thyroid storm is made through a combination of clinical features and thyroid function testing, which shows increased serum concentrations of triiodothyronine (T and thyroxine (T and a decreased ) ), 3 4 concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Management requires supportive care, treatment of the underlying provocative stress, as well as intravenous corticosteroids, ~-adrenergic blockers, propylthiouracil, and potassium iodide. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Blood culture (Choice A) is an appropriate step for the diagnosis of bacteremia and sepsis. This patient's altered mental status, hyperreflexia, and known history of Graves disease is more concerning for thyroid storm. Complete blood count with differential (Choice B) may disclose neutrophilia in the setting of pneumonia or leukocytosis in the setting of thyroid storm. These findings are relatively nonspecific and are less useful for the diagnosis in comparison to thyroid function testing. CT scan of the head (Choice C) is useful for excluding the presence of intracranial mass lesions prior to performing a lumbar puncture in patients with meningitis. Meningitis presents with fever, headache, photophobia, phonophobia, and neck stiffness, with possible Kernig or Brudzinski signs on examination. Measurement of serum calcium and magnesium concentrations (Choice D) may be useful for assessing potential causes of hyperreflexia. However, this patient's vital signs and her known history of Graves disease suggest thyroid storm rather than electrolyte derangement as the most likely cause of her hyperreflexia. Educational Objective: Thyroid storm is a serious potential complication of hyperthyroidism. It typically occurs in patients with a known diagnosis of hyperthyroidism following physiologic stress, such as infection (eg, pneumonia), surgery, or trauma. Thyroid storm presents with vital sign instability, mental status changes including agitation, obtundation, or coma, tremor, seizures, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, nausea, diarrhea, and potential high-output heart failure Exam Section: Item 3-4 of 50",

High rates of gallstone formation are also seen after periods of rapid weight loss, though the mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood. Acute cholecystitis typically presents with fever, abdominal pain, and tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant, often in a patient with a history of biliary colic and cholelithiasis. The pain may also radiate to the right shoulder or interscapular region. It may be distinguished from biliary colic by its constant rather than intermittent nature and associated findings of fever and leukocytosis. Abdominal ultrasonography is the first-line diagnostic examination for the evaluation of potential acute cholecystitis. Characteristic ultrasonography findings of acute cholecystitis include gallbladder wall thickening and hyperemia, pericholecystic fluid, presence of gallstones, a dilated cystic duct or common bile duct, and a sonographic Murphy sign (pain with compression directly over the gallbladder). Treatment includes supportive therapy, intravenous fluids, intravenous antibiotics, and urgent surgical resection of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy).

Failure to place the patient in Trendelenburg position (Choice C) may increase the difficulty of placing a central venous catheter in the jugular or subclavian veins. However, this positioning may not be possible in very ill patients and is not mandatory for the treatment of shock. Positioning may skew measurement of central venous pressure, though no abnormality in positioning is suggested in this case. Improper placement of the central venous catheter (Choice D) is unlikely given the successful administration of antibiotics and fluids. This patient's refractory hypotension is more concerning for septic shock than for a misplaced central line."

This patient is presenting with shortness of breath and shallow respirations with associated hypercarbic respiratory failure as seen on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. This patient likely has underlying obstructive lung disease secondary to obstructive sleep apnea or obesity hypoventilation syndrome , as evidenced by an increased HC0 indicating a compensatory metabolic alkalosis in the setting of 3 respiratory acidosis. Nevertheless , and regardless of the reason for the derangement , this patient's hypercarbia is severe, acute on chronic, and causing persistent respiratory acidosis as evidenced by a decreased pH in spite of noninvasive and appropriate corrective measures. Hypercarbia is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's decreased level of consciousness and is likely compounding baseline deficits from dementia . Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is often the first step in the management of hypercarbic respiratory failure, but if it is insufficient, as in this case with continued altered mental status and severe acidosis, endotracheal intubation to protect the airway and facilitate invasive positive pressure ventilation is necessary. Incorrect Answers : A, B, C, and D. Adjusting bilevel positive pressure ventilation settings (Choice A) would be appropriate if the patient showed a positive response to initial treatment or if initial settings were incorrect or inadequate. However, the patient's mental status remains unchanged , making intubation a more appropriate next step. Administering albuterol, helium, oxygen, or methylprednisolone (Choices B, C, and D) can be helpful in the setting of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and may be helpful in this patient with hypercarbic respiratory failure. However, medical management should follow endotracheal intubation, which is the most appropriate next step.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Gastritis classically presents with left upper quadrant or epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. If erosive gastritis or an ulcer is present, emesis may be blood-streaked, frankly bloody, or coffee-ground in character. If bleeding has been present for several hours, stool may be melanotic. Gastritis commonly occurs from alcohol abuse, excess use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, infections, or smoking. Other causes of upper gastrointestina l (GI) bleeding include esophagitis, esophagea l varices, peptic ulcer disease, and arteriovenous malformations. Regardless of the cause of bleeding, any patient presenting with tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, and signs of hemorrhagic shock (such as this patient's borderline hypotension) should receive immediate intravenous fluid resuscitation, typically with isotonic crystalloids such as 0.9% saline. Massive hematemesis, persistent hemodynamic instability, or concern for active bleeding should prompt emergent blood transfusion.",

        "C": "Insertion of a nasogastric tube has a role in gastric decompression in cases of small bowel obstruction but does not have a primary role in the management of undifferentiated upper gastrointestina l bleeding. It is arguably contraindicated in cases of esophageal varices, as placement of the tube may exacerbate a variceal bleed by disrupting a thrombus or worsening the culprit bleeding lesion. A tagged red blood cell scan (Choice D) can be used in the diagnosis of lower gastrointestina l bleeding to evaluate for the site of bleeding. In this case, the patient is likely experiencing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be diagnosed with upper endoscopy. Regardless, further diagnostic tests are not appropriate prior to managing this patient's hemodynamic instability. Upper endoscopy (Choice E) is the definitive means of diagnosis and treatment for a patient with gastrointestinal bleeding suspected to come from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum (upper GI tract). However, it should take place after fluid resuscitation and stabilization of the patient's hemodynamics."

Intravenous potassium supplementation should always be given before insulin if the serum potassium concentration is below 3.5 mEq/L as insulin causes potassium to shift intracellularly, which can lead to life-threatening hypokalemia with consequent cardiac arrhythmias and death. The potassium concentration should be monitored frequently during intravenous insulin administration and should be repleted when it falls below 3.5 mEq/L.",

Management of heat-related illness involves removing the individual from the heat, removing excess clothing, and initiating cooling measures such as immersion in cool water or evaporative cooling. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. While exercise can lead to the depletion of magnesium (Choice A), it would not explain the patient's hyperthermia and altered mental status. Exercise typically causes hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia (Choice B) as a result of potassium release from muscle cells. Potassium derangement would generally only cause muscle cramps and ECG abnormalities and would not completely explain the clinical picture in this case. High-output cardiac failure (Choice C) presents with shortness of breath, orthopnea, paroxysma l nocturnal dyspnea, and peripheral edema, often in the setting of an arteriovenous fistula, cirrhosis, sepsis, or severe anemia. In an athlete presenting after running a marathon, heat stroke is more likely. Creatine kinase is an enzyme found primarily in muscle cells, which is released in states of myocyte destruction or turnover and serves as an accurate surrogate marker for myocyte injury. Intense exercise can lead to myocyte injury and rhabdomyolysis, characterized by myalgias, myoglobinuria, and acute kidney injury. While exercise can release creatine kinase from muscle cells (Choice E), it would not be sufficient to explain the patient's hyperthermia and altered mental status."

Renal calculi typically cause symptoms of unilateral acute flank or back pain, nausea, vomiting, and hematuria. There are three main sites of anatomic narrowing along the ureter that may obstruct the passage of a calculus: at the ureteropelvic junction of the renal pelvis and the ureter, the ureterovesical junction as the ureter enters the posterior bladder, and at the pelvic inlet when the ureter crosses the common iliac vessel bifurcation.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cardiogenic pulmonary edema results from increased filling pressures or impaired forward flow in the heart. This increases hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary venous circulation, resulting in the transudation of fluid from the pulmonary capillaries into the pulmonary interstitial and alveolar spaces, impairing gas exchange. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema can be brought on suddenly by an increase in blood pressure (known as \"flash\" pulmonary edema), which is likely the cause in this case. Patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema typically experience progressive dyspnea on exertion and then at rest, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and orthopnea. Physical examination findings include hypoxia, crackles (representing fluid-filled alveoli opening suddenly), and decreased breath sounds. Initially, crackles will be present only in the dependent regions of the lung, but with increasing severity of edema, will spread to involve the lung fields diffusely. This patient's lower extremity edema further suggests a status of volume overload. The chest x-ray also demonstrates diffuse interstitial infiltrates, suggesting pulmonary edema.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Acute bilateral pneumonia would not explain this patient's chest x-ray findings or peripheral edema. A patient with an acute infection may also be hypotensive as a feature of sepsis rather than severely hypertensive, as in this case. COPD exacerbation (Choice C) is characterized by shortness of breath and shallow respirations with wheezing present on physical examination. Accumulation of carbon dioxide as a result of the inability to fully expire will also cause a respiratory acidosis, which may present with altered mental status. The patient's physical examination findings are more consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Large, left-sided pleural effusion (Choice D) would demonstrate opacification of the left hemithorax with blunting of the left costophrenic angle. Physical examination would demonstrate dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds on the left side only. This patient's physical examination and x-ray findings instead suggest cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Pulmonary embolism (Choice E) presents with acute onset dyspnea and may present with pleuritic chest pain. Asymmetric lower extremity edema may be present, indicating the presence of a deep venous thrombosis. However, diffuse crackles and diffuse interstitial infiltrates are not characteristic. Additionally, hypotension and hemodynamic instability would be more likely than hypertension, especially in the setting of a large enough embolus to result in tachycardia and a new oxygen requirement."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction lasting less than 24 hours caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without evidence of infarction. This patient has developed focal neurologic deficits that resolved after 30 minutes, qualifying as a TIA. TIA can be induced by either an embolus arising from a proximal site or from temporarily decreased blood flow to a watershed area in the brain. A \"low-flow\" TIA typically lasts minutes while an embolic TIA lasts longer, as in this case. An embolic ischemic stroke involves an event in which a clot breaks off and travels to the brain, occluding blood flow within a cerebral artery. Emboli most commonly originate from proximal vessels, such as the internal carotid artery, or from an atrial thrombus. If the embolus successfully undergoes physiologic thrombolysis, blood flow is restored to the affected area and reverses the clinical symptoms. After a TIA, measures for the prevention of an ischemic stroke should be enacted. In this case, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to administer for secondary prophylaxis of a cerebral infarction is aspirin. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are also stroke risk factors which should be optimized, though in this case the patient is already receiving treatment for these comorbidities.",

        "B": "Clopidogrel or dipyridamole (Choice C) may be used as combination therapy with aspirin in patients with a TIA or stroke who are already taking aspirin. However, as this patient's only previous medications are lisinopril and pravastatin, aspirin is the first-line choice for secondary prophylaxis of a cerebral infarction. Tissue plasminogen activator (Choice D) is used for its thrombolytic properties to treat ischemic stroke provided that it can be initiated within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Because this patient's symptoms have resolved, she does not require tissue plasminogen activator. Oral anticoagulation with warfarin (Choice E) may be indicated in a patient with atrial fibrillation who develops a TIA. However, in this patient whose only comorbidities are hyperlipidemia and hypertension, warfarin is not indicated and carries an unnecessary increased risk for bleeding."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The spleen is one of the most common organs damaged during blunt abdominal trauma, with injury patterns such as laceration and rupture. Ultrasonography demonstrates the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, with hypoechoic fluid in between the spleen and the left kidney, raising concern for acute blood products in the setting of trauma. Splenic rupture can cause large amounts of blood to leak into the peritoneal and retroperitoneal spaces, which can result in hemodynamic instability characterized by tachycardia and if severe, hypotension. Patients with splenic injuries may have left upper quadrant tenderness, peritonitis from blood products irritating the peritoneum, or referred pain to the left shoulder secondary to diaphragmatic irritation. In hemodynamically stable patients, minor splenic injuries may be treated nonoperatively with observation and reassessment. In unstable patients, exploratory laparotomy is required for repair of the injury or splenectomy, depending on the nature and severity of the splenic injury.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Duodenal hematoma can occur after blunt abdominal trauma to the epigastric region, especially in children (eg, seat belt injury). The presentation can be subtle with nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and decreased oral intake. Patients may demonstrate a midline mass on examination along with increased amylase and lipase concentrations on laboratory examination caused by associated pancreatitis. Duodenal hematomas can be diagnosed on CT scan of the abdomen, but not on a focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination, which evaluates for free fluid in the abdomen. Laceration of the inferior vena cava (IVC) (Choice B) is an uncommon injury because of its retroperitoneal position and protection by surrounding structures. An IVC injury can lead to severe hemorrhage and high mortality. Because of its retroperitoneal location, free fluid may not appear on a FAST examination, which primarily evaluates for intraperitoneal blood and fluid. As a result of its retroperitoneal location, laceration of the left kidney (Choice C) would not cause intraperitoneal free fluid. A FAST examination showing intraperitoneal free fluid in the left upper quadrant is more likely caused by a splenic injury. Kidney injury can present with hematuria and is best evaluated with a CT scan. Perforated viscus (Choice D) can present after blunt abdominal trauma with abdominal pain, distention, tenderness to palpation, peritonitis, anemia, leukocytosis, and x-ray evidence of pneumoperitoneum. Peritonitis requires an emergent surgical laparotomy to identify and repair any perforation, lavage the peritoneum, and prevent sepsis, exsanguination, and bowel necrosis."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient's laboratory panel suggests severe dehydration as the primary aberrancy driving his clinical picture. Features of severe Correct Answer: C. This patient's laboratory panel suggests severe dehydration as the primary aberrancy driving his clinical picture. Features of severe dehydration include hypotension, tachycardia, decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, and flat neck veins. His severely increased creatinine concentrations suggests acute prerenal kidney injury, which is caused by ineffective perfusion of the kidneys, whether caused by hypovolemia, as in this case, or hypotension. His hyperglycemia also suggests a high serum osmolality induced by dehydration as does his hypercalcemia. Treatment of dehydration and prerenal kidney injury is with intravenous isotonic fluids, such as 0.9% saline. This will expand his intravascular volume and improve perfusion to the kidneys. However, if decreased perfusion to the kidneys persists to the point of ischemia, then acute tubular necrosis, a form of intrinsic kidney injury, can develop. Prerenal and intrinsic kidney injury can be distinguished by the fractional excretion of sodium, which is <1 % in prerenal and >2% in intrinsic kidney in Jury.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Administration of insulin is not the best first step as the primary cause of his hyperglycemia is dehydration. Administering insulin would be critical if the patient were demonstrating signs of diabetic ketoacidosis. However, he has a normal serum bicarbonate and anion gap at this time. Thus, addressing his dehydration will likely resolve the majority of his hyperglycemia and should be the first step in management. Administration of metoprolol (Choice B) is not appropriate in this case as the patient is tachycardic as a result of dehydration, not because of a primary arrhythmia. The patient's decreased intravascular volume and consequent decreased stroke volume require tachycardia to maintain cardiac output and hemodynamic stability. If metoprolol were administered, his heart rate would decrease, and he would likely begin to suffer further complications of inadequate perfusion and end-organ ischemia. CT scan of the head (Choice D) may be warranted as a component of this patient's work-up but is not the most appropriate first step in management. If the patient is still disoriented after correcting his metabolic disturbances, then a CT scan of the head is warranted.",
        "E": "Hemodialysis is indicated when acute kidney injury causes severe acidemia, electrolyte disturbances such as hyperkalemia , volume overload, or uremia. None of these are present in this case. This patient's prerenal kidney injury will likely correct with intravenous fluid administration. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder (Choice F) is indicated in patients whose acute kidney injury is suspected to be caused by postrenal obstruction causing hydronephrosis, such as nephrolithiasis or an enlarged prostate. This patient's clinical and laboratory picture are more consistent with a prerenal cause."

This patient's history of wrist pain overlying the snuffbox following a fall on an outstretched hand, as well as her radiographic findings, are consistent with a scaphoid fracture. The scaphoid is at significant risk for fracture after falling on an outstretched hand because of its narrow and fragile central waist. Scaphoid fractures can have significant and long-lasting effects as a result of the risk for nonunion and proximal osteonecrosis of the bone, which receives its vascular supply in a distal-to-proximal fashion. Patients with non-displaced scaphoid fractures should undergo thumb spica splinting until union has been demonstrated with follow-up x-rays. Patients with displaced fractures , carpal instability, or delayed presentation should be referred for surgical repair. Incorrect Answers : A, B, C, and D. Activity as tolerated (Choice A) prior to union of the fracture increases the patient's risk for non-union and of prolonged functional deficits. Arthrocentesis (Choice B) is useful for the diagnosis of septic or inflammatory arthritis. This patient's lack of fever and her presentation immediately following a fall are more suggestive of a traumatic fracture of the scaphoid. Elastic bandage and ice packs (Choice C) will result in insufficient restriction of mobility in comparison to a thumb spica splint and are not recommended for the treatment of a scaphoid fracture. Fracture reduction (Choice D) is recommended for displaced scaphoid fractures, carpal instability, or patients with a delayed presentation. This patient's x-rays are more consistent with a non-displaced acute scaphoid fracture.

Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. High-sodium diet (Choice A), in addition to obesity, can contribute to the development of hypertension, which is apparent in this patient, but a high-sodium diet does not predispose to VTE. Lack of exercise (Choice B) is not a risk factor for VTE, although prolonged periods of immobility such as during international flights may confer some increased risk. Uncontrolled hypertension (Choice C) increases the risk for myocardia l infarction and stroke but does not increase the risk for VTE.

Smoke inhalation injury should be suspected in patients presenting with facial burns, hoarse voice, wheezing, soot in the airway, strider, or carbonaceous sputum. The inhalation of smoke and additional chemicals in the setting of a fire presents the risk for injury to the pharyngeal, laryngeal, and tracheal mucosa. Resultant inflammation drives the rapid development of mucosa! edema, which can cause acute airway obstruction. Airway obstruction is an immediate life-threatening condition that must be managed at or before the time it occurs. If care is not taken to immediately maintain an unobstructed path for air to flow into the tracheobronchia l tree, rapid hypoxia, hypercapnia, and death can occur if significant airway edema ensues.

Endotrachea l intubation is the most appropriate next step in management of the patient's airway in the setting of acute smoke inhalation injury. Smoke inhalation injury should be suspected in patients presenting with facial burns, hoarse voice, wheezing, soot in the airway, strider, or carbonaceous sputum. The inhalation of smoke and additional chemicals in the setting of a fire presents the risk for injury to the pharyngeal, laryngea l, and tracheal mucosa. Resultant inflammation drives the rapid development of mucosal edema, which can cause acute airway obstruction. Airway obstruction is an immediate life-threatening condition that must be managed at or before the time it occurs. If care is not taken to immediately maintain an unobstructed path for air to flow into the tracheobronchia l tree, rapid hypoxia, hypercapnia, and death can occur if significant airway edema ensues. Emergent endotrachea l intubation is the most appropriate initial step and should be performed immediately to prevent airway obstruction. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Cyanide inhibits the electron transport chain, leading to lactic acidosis, compensatory respiratory alkalosis, hypotension, lethargy, and bradycardia. The management of cyanide poisoning includes supportive care with intravenous fluids and vasopressors, sodium thiosulfate, which increases the conversion of cyanide to thiocyanate for renal excretion, amyl nitrites (Choice A) to induce methemoglobinemia, which binds with cyanide and prevents it from acting on the electron transport chain, and hydroxocoba lamin (Choice B), which combines with cyanide to create nontoxic cyanocobalamin. This patient may require these interventions but not prior to securing the airway. Arterial blood gas analysis (Choice C) and an x-ray of the chest (Choice E) are not helpful at this time to make further decisions about management. This patient is at risk for imminent airway obstruction as a result of signs of smoke inhalation injury and strider on inspiration, and the next step in management of this patient is endotracheal intubation."

Cellulitis presents with cutaneous erythema, warmth, and induration, often following inoculation from an injury such as an abrasion. Systemic symptoms, including fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosi s are often present. Most commonly, it is acute and results from a bacterial infection of the skin. The two most common pathogens to cause cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A). Clinically, the cellulitis caused by S. aureus is typically purulent while that caused by S. pyogenes is not. Treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis, as seen in this case, is with empiric antibiotic therapy, which covers both S. aureus and S. pyogenes, such as cephalexin. If the cellulitis demonstrates purulence or the patient has a history of prior methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections, coverage of MRSA is also warranted. Potential oral antibiotic choices for MRSA coverage include doxycycline, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, or clindamycin.",

The patient is presenting with classic signs and symptoms of acute coronary syndrome, with angina, nausea, dyspnea, anxiety, and diaphoresis that began during exertion. Additional ly, the ECG shows marked ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads V2 through V6. Polarization and repolarization abnormalities along these vectors correspond with injury to the myocardial territory supplied by the left anterior descending coronary artery, which includes the anterior portion of the interventricular septum, the anterior left ventricle, and the anterolatera l papillary muscle. The left anterior descending artery branches from the left main coronary artery and perfuses a significant portion of the myocardium. An occlusive atherosclerotic or thromboembolic lesion in this vessel resulting in transmural myocardial ischemia and infarction is likely underlying this patient's presentation. Treatment requires the use of antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel) plus anticoagulants (eg, heparin), pain control, and revascularization through angioplasty, thrombolysis, or coronary artery bypass grafting. Potential complications include papillary muscle rupture with subsequent mitral regurgitation, dysrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, ventricular wall rupture, and post-infarction pericarditis.",

Infarction of this territory may result in ST-segment changes in the lateral, posterior, and/or inferior ECG leads (depending on right- or left-dominant coronary artery circulation). The posterior coronary (Choice C) artery, in the setting of a right-dominant circulation (~85% of patients), provides a majority of the blood supply to the inferior portion of the heart. Corresponding ST-segment changes are typically found in the inferior ECG leads II, Ill, and aVF.

Corresponding ST segment changes are typically seen in the inferior ECG leads II, Ill, and aVF. Impaired perfusion to the SA and AV nodes can also result in significant bradycardia or heart block. Septal perforating (Choice E) branches of the left anterior descending artery provide most of the blood supply to the interventricular septum.

The items in the set must be answered in sequential order. Once you click Proceed to Item, you will not be able to add or change an answer. A 73-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by paramedics because of a 4-day history of progressive shortness of breath. Paramedics report that during transport the patient was awake and alert. Pulse oximetry on room air showed an oxygen saturation of 88%; 4 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula was initiated. Diffuse wheezes were heard bilaterally and inhaled albuterol and ipratropium were administered. Medical history includes congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications are furosemide, albuterol, insulin, glyburide, and tramado l. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 50 years. On arrival, he is slow to respond and sleepy but easily aroused. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 167/ 98 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry now shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are normal and reactive. Severe inspiratory and expiratory wheezes are heard on auscultation. 'I 39. Item 1 of 2 Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's change in mental status during transport to the hospital? A) Circulating endotoxins Correct Answer: B. Hypercarbia most likely explains this patient's change in mental status during transport to the hospital. Patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly develop hypercarbia at baseline as a result of their obstructive disease, but acute exacerbations, which are frequently the result of respiratory tract infections, can lead to an acute worsening of the underlying obstruction. Patients present with increased dyspnea and wheezing, which represents turbulent airflow through the constricted bronchial tree. Concurrent cough and sputum production are also common. When the underlying obstruction is exacerbated by a trigger, patients develop profound air trapping and are less capable of expelling carbon dioxide. On arterial blood gas analysis, this manifests as an increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Severe hypercarbia can lead to lethargy and mental status changes. For this reason, all patients with a COPD exacerbation and altered mental status should be evaluated for the presence of hypercarbia. Treatment involves the administration of bronchodilator medications, steroids, and positive pressure ventilation. Occasionally, intubation is required if the patient becomes obtunded. Additionally, patients with COPD tend to have a lower oxygen saturation at baseline as a result of their underlying pulmonary parenchyma l disease. During COPD exacerbations, the goal oxygen saturation should target between 88% to 92%. Historically, administration of supplemental oxygen to raise the saturation beyond this amount has been postulated to blunt respiratory drive, though actual evidence for this is limited. It is probable instead that the administration of supplemental oxygen worsens ventilation-perfusion mismatch in this patient population. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E. Circulating endotoxins (Choice A) may be present in patients with sepsis. This patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation of his COPD d d t h 'd f • Exam Section : Item 39-40 of 50 • Hypercarbia most likely explains this patient's change in mental status during transport to the hospital. Patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly develop hypercarbia at baseline as a result of their obstructive disease, but acute exacerbations , which are frequently the result of respiratory tract infections, can lead to an acute worsening of the underlying obstruction. Patients present with increased dyspnea and wheezing , which represents turbulent airflow through the constricted bronchial tree. Concurrent cough and sputum production are also common. When the underlying obstruction is exacerbated by a trigger, patients develop profound air trapping and are less capable of expelling carbon dioxide. On arterial blood gas analysis, this manifests as an increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Severe hypercarbia can lead to lethargy and mental status changes. For this reason, all patients with a COPD exacerbation and altered mental status should be evaluated for the presence of hypercarbia . Treatment involves the administration of bronchodilator medications , steroids, and positive pressure ventilation. Occasionally, intubation is required if the patient becomes obtunded . Additionally , patients with COPD tend to have a lower oxygen saturation at baseline as a result of their underlying pulmonary parenchymal disease. During COPD exacerbations , the goal oxygen saturation should target between 88% to 92%. Historically, administration of supplemental oxygen to raise the saturation beyond this amount has been postulated to blunt respiratory drive, though actual evidence for this is limited. It is probable instead that the administration of supplemental oxygen worsens ventilation -perfusion mismatch in this patient population. Incorrect Answers : A, C, D, and E. Circulating endotoxins (Choice A) may be present in patients with sepsis. This patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation of his COPD and does not have evidence of sepsis. Hyperglycemic nonketotic coma (Choice C) is incorrect. This patient's symptoms are primarily respiratory, thus his altered mental status is more likely secondary to hypercarbia . A clinical history of hyperglycemia , polyuria, polydipsia, and dehydration would also be expected. Hypoxemia (Choice D) is incorrect. It is common for patients with COPD to have a low oxygen saturation at baseline. This patient's oxygen saturation of 88% corresponds with a partial pressure of oxygen of approximately 55 mm Hg. While this is lower than normal, it would be unlikely to cause altered mental status and may actually be a baseline, around-the-clock saturation for many patients with COPD. Medication adverse effect (Choice E) is incorrect. Insulin and glyburide can cause hypoglycemia, but this patient would likely have demonstrated altered mental status at the time when the paramedics arrived. Tramadol can also cause lethargy, but symptoms would have been expected at the scene. Educational Objective: Acute exacerbations of COPD cause increased air trapping and poor ventilation resulting in progressive hypercarbia. As well, the administration of supplemental oxygen during an acute exacerbation should target a goal oxygen saturation of 88% to 92%, as higher saturations can worsen the patient's underlying ventilation -perfusion mismatch. Severe hypercarbia can cause lethargy and altered mental status. F'",

Major causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) include peptic ulcer disease, Mallory-Weiss tear, gastritis, and Dieulafoy lesion among others, but few etiologies cause hemorrhage as dramatic and potentially catastrophic as ruptured esophageal varices. This patient has evidence of decompensated cirrhosis with a distended abdomen and fluid wave indicating ascites. Both ascites and esophageal varices are consequences of portal venous hypertension, which occurs as a result of obstruction of flow through the sinusoids within the liver. All patients with bleeding esophageal varices should have two large-bore intravenous catheters inserted for the administration of isotonic crystalloids and packed red blood cells (pRBCs). This patient continues to have signs of hemorrhagic shock despite adequate fluid resuscitation; thus, he should also receive pRBCs. Additionally, patients with bleeding varices should receive intravenous antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone, an octreotide infusion, and a proton pump inhibitor. Initial care should focus on stabilizing the patient to facilitate upper endoscopy, at which point varices can be ligated for definitive source control and to prevent further bleeding.",

Even though the international normalized ratio (INR) may be increased in patients with cirrhosis, these patients may be prone to either abnormal clotting or bleeding. Esophageal rupture (Choice C) presents with severe retrosternal pain and signs of sepsis, not gastrointestinal bleeding. Esophageal rupture may occur as a result of trauma, instrumentation during endoscopy, or from violent retching. He/icobacter pylori infection (Choice D) causes peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, which may cause gastrointestinal bleeding, but it does not frequently cause life-threatening hemorrhage and is more likely to present with epigastric pain and melena."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Alcohol use disorder causes changes in the expression of central nervous system y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate receptor subunits, leading to sympathetic hyperactivity in the setting of alcohol withdrawal. Initially, this hyperexcitability results in tremors, anxiety, diaphoresis, hypertension, tachycardia, and nausea. Within hours of the last drink, alcoholic hallucinosis (auditory or visual hallucinations without confusion or autonomic instability) and seizures (as a result of cortical hyperactivity) can occur. Delirium tremens, the most concerning and life-threatening complication of alcohol withdrawal, involves severe confusion and disorientation, fluctuations in consciousness, agitation, visual hallucinations, and autonomic instability (fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure with hyperthermia). As a result of their activating effect on GABA receptors, benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, are effective in reducing the psychomotor hyperactivity associated with alcohol withdrawal. Long-acting benzodiazepines are preferred because they reduce the risk for recurrent seizures. Many centers employ a symptom-based approach to the treatment of alcohol withdrawal using clinical assessment tools such as the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised (CIWA-Ar) scale .",

Treatment with anticonvulsants, such as phenytoin (Choice D) or valproic acid (Choice E), is not typically necessary for seizures associated with alcohol withdrawal and does not address the underlying cause of the seizures. Benzodiazepine or barbiturate doses, in escalation, are most appropriate."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The ECG shows torsades de pointes, a dangerous form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia characterized by a sinusoidal pattern with cyclic variation in amplitude. Episodes are typically brief and resolve spontaneously, but patients are at risk for progressing to ventricular fibrillation , hemodynamic collapse, and death. Patients with prolongation of the Q-T interval (which may be familial or acquired, such as with adverse effects of several medications) ,are susceptible to developing torsades de pointes. Medications that are associated with torsades de pointes include class IA and Ill antijarrhythmic agents, macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics , methadone, antipsychotics , antidepressants , antiemetics, and diuretics such as furosemide . Hypomagnesemia , hypokalemia , and hypocalcemia also increase risk. The patient presentation typically involves palpitations, syncope, lightheadedness , tachycardia , and pallor. Immediate treatment requires intravenous magnesium administration , which inhibits calcium influx into myocardial cells and suppresses early afterdepolarizations to interrupt the arrhythmia. Any potential QT-prolonging medications should be discontinued , and consultation with a cardiologist or electrophysiologist is recommended to determine if long-term pharmacologic therapy or an implantable cardiac device is indicated. Hemodynamically unstable patients generally require cardioversion (which may not be possible given the polymorphic nature of the arrhythmia) or defibrillation . Incorrect Answers : A, B, C, D, and E. Amiodarone (Choice A) is an antiarrhythmic agent that is commonly used to treat ventricular arrhythmias ; however, it causes QT prolongation and can worsen torsades de pointes. Amiodarone should be avoided in this patient. Atropine (Choice B) is an anticholinergic agent used in the treatment of bradyarrhythmias because of its muscarinic inhibition . Atropine increases heart rate and shortens the Q-T interval but is not recommended in the treatment of torsades de pointes . Magnesium administration is standard therapy. Calcium gluconate (Choice C) may be considered in addition to magnesium in the treatment of torsades de pointes, as hypocalcemia increases the risk for the arrhythmia as well. Magnesium should be administered first. Epinephrine (Choice D) is used in the treatment of numerous cardiac arrhythmias as a result of its positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. Increasing the heart rate shortens the Q-T interval and may provide a benefit; however, magnesium has been demonstrated as the most effective initial therapy. Lidocaine (Choice E) may be considered as an adjunct to magnesium for persistent torsades de pointes as it does not prolong the Q-T interval. Magnesium should be administered first.

The pain occurs at rest or with minimal exertion. He rates the pain as an 8 on a 10-point scale. Nitroglycerin has provided\nonly moderate relief. He has not had diaphoresis, nausea, or dyspnea. He has coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.\nHe has no history of liver disease or bleeding problems. In addition to nitroglycerin, medications include glyburide, valsartan, and\nhydrochlorothiazide. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 85 kg (188 lb); BMI is 27 kg/m2 . His temperatu re is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 87/min,\nrespirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/68 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. Physical\nexamination discloses no abnormalities. A chest x-ray shows minimal cardiomega ly. An ECG shows T-wave inversions in the anterior leads not\nseen on previous ECGs. Serum cardiac enzyme concentrations are within the reference ranges. The patient is given 3 L of oxygen via nasal\ncannula. Morphine (4 mg) is administered, and the patient is pain-free. In addition to administration of aspirin, which of the following is the most\nappropriate next step?",

This 61-year-old patient with a history of stable angina but with new onset chest pain at rest and T-wave inversions in the anterior leads most likely has unstable angina. There are three primary categories of acute coronary syndrome (ACS): unstable angina (UA), non-ST-elevation myocardia l infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A STEMI presents with chest pain, ST elevations on ECG, and positive cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponin). Treatment is with thrombolytics or immediate cardiac catheterization.

Administration of heparin is the next most appropriate step. This 61-year-old patient with a history of stable angina but with new onset chest pain at rest and T-wave inversions in the anterior leads most likely has unstable angina. There are three primary categories of acute coronary syndrome (ACS): unstable angina (UA), non-ST-elevation myocardia l infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Appropriate anticoagulant choices include either unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin. Patients are then typically risk stratified using various scoring models to determine the urgency of cardiac catheterization, but most will undergo catheterization within 24 hours. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (Choice B) is appropriate for patients with a STEMI who do not have immediate access to a cardiac catheterization suite. Thrombolytics are not given for UA or NSTEMI. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (Choice C) is used as an adjunctive measure in patients with cardiogenic shock secondary to ACS. This patient does not have evidence of cardiogenic shock. Referral to a cardiac surgeon (Choice D) is not appropriate at this time. The patient should first be treated with anticoagulants and antiplatelets followed by cardiac catheterization. In patients with multivessel coronary disease not amenable to cardiac stent placement, coronary artery bypass graft surgery is an alternative option. Ventilation-perfusion lung scan (Choice E) is one imaging modality used to diagnose a pulmonary embolism (PE). While this patient's symptoms could be secondary to a PE, his known cardiac disease, worsening chest pain, and new ECG changes are more consistent with unstable angina."

Heart failure and atrial fibrillation share many common risk factors, and each predisposes to development of the other. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (pulse >100/min) can result in reduced stroke volume and decreased cardiac output leading to symptomatic heart failure, and potentially hypotension and hemodynamic instability in severe cases. This patient is presenting with hemodynamically unstable atrial fibrillation with hypotension and tachycardia.
