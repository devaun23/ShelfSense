    "correct_explanation": "This patient should begin isoniazid therapy for treatment of potential latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Controlling the spread of TB relies on the diagnosis and management of patients with active TB infection and potential latent\ninfection, which has a risk for reactivating into symptomatic, transmissible disease. There is no definitive test for latent TB infection, and diagnosis is based on clinical risk factors and a demonstrable immune response to TB\nantigens. The immune response may be disclosed using the PPD skin test or an interferon-gamma release assay. In this patient, receipt of the BCG vaccine in childhood can make interpretation of the PPD skin test challenging, as\nthe immune response may be caused by the presence of latent TB or because of prior BCG vaccination. Given this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends interpreting PPD skin tests the same for\nBCG-vaccinated and non-BCG-vaccinated individuals. For patients with greater than 10 mm induration on PPD skin test or a positive serum interferon-gamma release assay and a negative chest x-ray, treatment for latent TB\ninfection should be initiated if they fall into one of the following high-risk groups: recent immigration from a high-prevalence country, intravenous substance use, resident or employee of a setting in which people are in close contact\n(eg, correctional facility, nursing care facility, homeless shelter, hospital), presence of significant medical comorbidities, or pediatric patients exposed to high-risk adults. CDC guidelines now favor a shorter (3 to 4 months) rifamycin-\nbased and isoniazid combination regimen over isoniazid monotherapy, though of the options presented, only isoniazid monotherapy presents a correct choice. Rifamycin-based regimens are preferred given their efficacy, favorable\ntreatment completion rates, and relatively low hepatotoxicity rates.",

HAV is a nonenveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that is spread through fecal-oral transmission. It is commonly acquired through ingestion of poorly cooked, improperly handled, or raw foods,\nincluding shellfish. HAV has an incubation period of several weeks. Presenting signs and symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, abdominal pain, jaundice, and hepatomegaly, although many patients are\nasymptomatic. Laboratory findings include transaminitis, increased alkaline phosphatase, hyperbilirubinemia, and bilirubinuria. The diagnosis is confirmed by the serologic detection of anti-HAV IgM antibodies. HAV infection is\ntypically a self-limited illness and does not progress to chronic infection.\nIncorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D.\nChronic carrier state (Choice A) is not associated with HAV. Generally, once a patient has been infected with HAV, the disease is self-limiting and confers immunity. It would be extremely rare to enter a chronic carrier state of HAV.\nChronic hepatitis (Choice B) and hepatocellular carcinoma (Choice D) are not associated with HAV. Hepatitis B is more commonly associated with chronic infection, leading to cirrhosis and potentially hepatocellular carcinoma. For\nthis reason, vaccination against hepatitis B is commonly administered to newborns, although it can also be given in adulthood and is recommended for health care workers, injection drug users, men who have sex with men, and\npatients with HIV or hepatitis C.\nFulminant hepatitis (Choice C) is not commonly seen with HAV. Autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C are more likely to progress into fulminant hepatitis. In rare cases, HAV can become fulminant, but it is significantly\nmore likely to continue its course as a self-limited illness with no long-term effects.\nEducational Objective: Hepatitis A virus is a common cause of food poisoning and traveler’s diarrhea among travelers in the developing world. The disease course of hepatitis Ais generally benign with fever, nausea, vomiting, and\ndiarrhea, and further complications are rare. Vaccination against hepatitis A virus is recommended to all travelers who visit developing countries. ————SS\n\nComprehensive Clinical Science Self-Assessment\nSERSSeeeEe8 SEESSe00EE8 TTT TT TTT TT SE eee008888\nv HE] Prey yr ry yr PPT TT rrr rr ee ee]\nEESEEESEEES pede dee ad EEESEEEEEe Poy PP\nSERSEES0RE8 PTT TTT Tyr TT SIPS eee\nIBPBESEEEREH aVRFAREEEERRAS ViECEEEEERyRE Ve HACE CUPKLC\nEEEEEEEEEER po SERSSEEeUES ee eee\nEEEEEESEEee SSeS 00008 Piet ttt | a eon\nSBI penn tae8 SESS 000808 PTTATT TT AT\nWESSEL av PSS aE HS Me BHC Web the eh\nEESEEEEEEES Eee SR8 BEeesiiee EEESERERE8R\nEERE HEH EGE Eee) | eect\nul Soo aVF ESTEE ESTSS V3 ans Ghee ee Ve ee SP eos\nBEE Eee ee ee Ee\nooo ooo ooo\net aaa (eeser succes aces feuer Geeee (eeeves\nBEE EEE\nSesdtasftes vocttard ari eteritesitisatart\n“ 4 pa“ Is pO) 7\nysuagas teaserssceersecsessey sesseseeeeeas\nHEHEHE EEE HH SEE88 (ees ee\nSet Pens Ieee eee ee a eNees pun a neee ine\nVv. pl Bue PIES pe ee\n5 CO eee eee\nSESE ESEREEE RES EE BE ERE eee"

Caudal regression syndrome falls under the umbrella of diabetic\nembryopathies and includes conditions in which there is an anomaly in the embryo associated with diabetes in the mother. Most often, this is caused by poor control of diabetes and hyperglycemia prior to and during pregnancy. The\ntheorized pathophysiology of these disorders involves abnormal myoinositol uptake, which leads to abnormalities in the arachidonic acid and prostaglandin pathway.

    "correct_explanation": "This patient presents with signs of osteomalacia secondary to vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D plays a role in serum calcium and phosphate homeostasis by promoting intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate, increasing bone\nmineralization at low concentrations, and bone resorption at higher concentrations. Vitamin D deficiency can be caused by malabsorption in the intestinal tract, malnutrition or insufficient dietary intake, and decreased sun exposure.\nElderly patients are at particularly increased risk for vitamin D deficiency as a result of decreased vitamin D synthesis with age and lack of sunlight exposure. Patients dependent on parenteral nutrition often have poor oral intake\nand are very frequently vitamin D deficient. Decreased concentrations of vitamin D result in decreased intestinal calcium absorption and hypocalcemia, sensed by the parathyroid gland via calcium-sensing receptors, leading to an\nincrease in secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) to normalize serum calcium levels. Increased PTH stimulates osteoclastic bone reabsorption and distal convoluted tubular calcium reabsorption and phosphate excretion in the\nkidney. These mechanisms are often inadequate to maintain calcium homeostasis and lead to osteomalacia, an adult form of vitamin D deficiency characterized by loss of bone mineral density and abnormal osteoid mineralization.\nPatients with osteomalacia present with nonspecific symptoms including muscular weakness, myalgia, bone pain, and in later stages may have bone deformity, gait alteration, and falls. Patients may also have signs and symptoms\nof hypocalcemia including confusion, memory difficulties, myalgias, and perioral and/or peripheral paresthesias. Pseudofractures, also known as looser zones, are a type of insufficiency fracture that are characteristic of\nosteomalacia and are visible on x-rays as lines of lucency corresponding to areas of low bone mineral density. Pseudofractures typically occur in the ribs, posterior ulna, pubic and iliac bones, and in the femoral neck or shaft.\nTreatment is with oral supplementation of both vitamin D and calcium, and typically results in improvement in symptoms of weakness and pain, as well as normalization of laboratory values.",

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an\nimmune-mediated demyelinating disease. Onset usually occurs between the ages of 20 to 40 years and is most common in those assigned female at birth. Additional risk factors include residing in temperate climates and having a\nfamily history of MS. Presenting symptoms depend on the location of the lesion. Optic neuritis is a common initial manifestation and typically presents with poor visual acuity and a consequent afferent pupillary defect on physical\nexamination. According to the McDonald criteria for diagnosing MS, the patient must have evidence of demyelinating lesions that are separated in time and location. This evidence can be based on subjective symptoms and/or\nimaging evidence. This patient presents with episodic neurologic symptoms that could be localized to different central nervous system locations (eg, optic nerve, cerebral white matter) at different times. Oligoclonal bands of\nimmunoglobulins, indicating immune overactivation, can be found in the cerebrospinal fluid, but are not necessary for diagnosis. Treatment includes corticosteroids for symptomatic management of acute flares and long-term\ndisease-modifying treatments, such as interferons, monoclonal antibodies, and immunomodulators (eg, subcutaneous glatiramer).",

Abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, as seen in this patient who has not had a drink in 2 days, leads to\nsympathetic (excitatory) excess. Uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal typically presents with tremors, anxiety, restlessness, headache, nausea, and diaphoresis, which can occur hours after the cessation of alcohol use. If left\nuntreated, alcohol withdrawal can be complicated by seizures and alcoholic hallucinosis (auditory or visual hallucinations). Delirium tremens, the most concerning and life-threatening complication of alcohol withdrawal, involves\nsevere confusion and disorientation, fluctuations in consciousness, agitation, visual hallucinations, and autonomic instability (fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure with hyperthermia). Alcohol withdrawal is managed with\nbenzodiazepines (eg, diazepam) to prevent or treat the symptoms of withdrawal, including agitation, and reduce risk for seizures. Additional supportive care is with fluids, nutritional supplementation, and frequent assessment\nincluding vital sign checks.\nIncorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E.\nDisulfiram (Choice B) inhibits some isoforms of aldehyde dehydrogenase, resulting in acetaldehyde accumulation. This accumulation causes nausea and vomiting in patients who concurrently take the medication and drink alcohol.\nThis would not be beneficial in a patient with acute alcohol withdrawal.\nFresh frozen plasma (Choice C) contains clotting factors in addition to fibrinogen, antithrombin III, and other plasma proteins. It has traditionally been used to replace clotting factors in a variety of coagulant-deficient diseases, such\nas disseminated intravascular coagulation, but the use of cryoprecipitate and/or prothrombin complex concentrates have largely supplanted its use. It would not be beneficial in this patient.\nLactulose (Choice D) is the treatment of choice for hepatic encephalopathy. This is most commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis whose ability to process ammonia from the gastrointestinal tract is impaired. It is not generally used\nin patients with acute alcohol withdrawal.\nPropranolol (Choice E) is a nonselective B-adrenergic antagonist with similar activity at 8B; and By receptors. It may be used in the treatment of hypertension, arrhythmias, migraines, essential tremor, and hyperthyroidism. While\npropranolol may decrease this patient’s heart rate and control some symptoms related to her withdrawal, it will not improve her seizure risk, making diazepam a more appropriate option.\nEducational Objective: Alcohol withdrawal typically presents with tremors, anxiety, restlessness, headache, nausea, and diaphoresis. It can be complicated by seizures, alcoholic hallucinosis, and delirium tremens. It is treated with\nbenzodiazepines.\n\nComprehensive Clinical Science Self-Assessment"

CGD results from a defect in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide\nphosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex. NADPH oxidase complex within phagocytes, such as neutrophils, uses oxygen as a substrate for the generation of oxygen-free radicals (superoxide anions). Free radical oxygen species are\nsubsequently used for the creation of hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid. Activation of this pathway leads to an oxidative burst, which results in bacterial death. Deficiency of the NADPH oxidase complex renders phagocytes\nincapable of neutralizing catalase-positive bacteria, which are capable of neutralizing their own hydrogen peroxide, thus leaving the host cells without a substrate necessary to complete the respiratory burst. Diagnosis is made by\nassessing the neutrophil oxidative burst with a dihydrorhodamine test or a nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test. In the latter test, normal phagocytes use the action of NADPH to reduce nitroblue, which leads to a color change from\nyellow to blue. Patients with CGD will not show a color change.

    "correct_explanation": "Choice A corresponds with a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Erythrocytes in the setting of IDA are pale (hypochromic) and small (microcytic), but normal in shape. Iron is required for the synthesis of heme, which is a\nnecessary component of the hemoglobin molecule, and thus of erythrocytes. It functions to shuttle oxygen to and from peripheral tissues. In individuals who do not have adequate intake of dietary iron in the form of heme,\ndeficiency can develop. IDA may also develop as a result of chronic blood loss from menstruation or colorectal bleeding, or can occur as a result of malabsorption syndromes such as celiac disease and in patients who have\nundergone gastric bypass surgery. Another common cause is underproduction of erythrocytes, as seen in this patient with chronic alcohol use and evidence of hepatic damage. Erythrocytes on peripheral blood smear are\nhypochromic as a result of deficient hemoglobin concentration. It is thought that erythrocytes are microcytic as a result of continuing erythrocyte division in order to reach an adequate hemoglobin concentration. Because\nhemoglobin stores are inadequate, cell division continues beyond what would normally occur and causes the cells to be smaller than normal. Ferritin stores are depleted in IDA and as a result, transferrin saturations are\ndecreased. Treatment in the case of poor dietary intake is with oral iron supplementation. If severe, intravenous iron can be given.",
    "educational_objective": "Iron deficiency anemia most commonly results from chronic gastrointestinal blood loss but can also be seen in patients with malnutrition and chronic alcohol use. Patients with iron deficiency anemia will\nhave low concentrations of serum iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin. Blood smear will show a microcytic, hypochromic anemia.\n\n¥"

It encompasses many types of breast carcinoma, including invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma, medullary\ncarcinoma, inflammatory breast carcinoma, and cystosarcoma phyllodes, with the most common type being invasive ductal carcinoma. Risk factors for the development of breast cancer include exogenous estrogen administration,\na family history of breast cancer, genetic mutation (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2), early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity, and obesity. It commonly presents with an abnormal, potentially palpable breast lump, with or without\nassociated skin or nipple retraction. However, many cases are asymptomatic and found on routine screening mammography. When a patient presents with a breast mass, the evaluation should include a physical examination and\nthorough history, including family history. Physical examination typically shows a smooth, rubbery, freely mobile mass without coexisting skin changes, lymphadenopathy, or nipple discharge in benign lesions. In contrast, malignant\nlesions often present with irregular, firm, adherent masses and one or more of these concurrent signs. Further evaluation includes diagnostic imaging with either ultrasonography, if under age 35 years, or mammography, if over age\n35 years. If the palpable lesion is not visible on the first modality, the subsequent modality should be used.

Patients with type 1\ndiabetes are insulin-dependent, as their pancreas, through an autoimmune mechanism, fails to produce an adequate amount of insulin to meet their needs. Human placental lactogen, produced by the placenta, additionally\nincreases maternal insulin resistance. This combination of factors leads to markedly increased concentrations of glucose in the maternal circulation, and subsequently, the fetal circulation. Maternal and fetal hyperglycemia early in\npregnancy can lead to severe birth defects and may even cause spontaneous abortion. Ongoing exposure to hyperglycemia can negatively impact neurocognitive development, as well as cause polycythemia in the newborn. Fetal\nhyperglycemia also causes the fetus to produce excess insulin. The insulin then acts as a growth factor, leading to macrosomia, and inhibits the production of surfactant. This relative deficiency of surfactant leads to increased\nalveolar surface tension, alveolar collapse, and hyaline membrane disease marked by fetal respiratory distress, hypoxia, rhonchi on auscultation, and diffuse alveolar infiltrates on imaging. Additional complications of maternal\ndiabetes include uteroplacental insufficiency, preeclampsia, and polyhydramnios.",

There are two\nmain causes of renal artery stenosis: fibromuscular dysplasia and atherosclerosis. In younger patients such as this patient, fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause, while older patients develop renal artery stenosis more\ncommonly from atherosclerosis. Due to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and high concentrations of angiotensin II, secondary hypertension develops. Angiotensin II also leads to increased sodium reabsorption\nin the renal tubules, aldosterone release by the adrenal cortex with subsequent increased sodium and fluid retention and hypokalemia, vasopressin release from the posterior pituitary leading to increased fluid retention, enhanced\nadrenergic function through inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake in sympathetic nerve endings, and stimulation of hypothalamic thirst centers. This patient has hypernatremia and hypokalemia due to increased angiotensin II\nconcentration. On physical examination, a bruit may be auscultated on the side of the renal artery stenosis. Urinalysis is typically normal. Diagnosis is established with renal artery Doppler ultrasonography or magnetic resonance\nangiography. Treatment involves angioplasty or stenting of the stenosed renal artery to improve flow. ACE inhibitors can be considered for unilateral renal artery stenosis but can lead to acute kidney injury in the setting of bilateral\nstenosis.",

Fibroblasts in the lungs become activated and produce excessive amounts of extracellular matrix proteins,\nleading to formation of fibrotic scar tissue. This excess tissue reduces the compliance of the lungs and makes it harder for them to expand. This leads to a decline in overall pulmonary function and a restrictive pattern of disease\ncharacterized by decreased total lung capacity. Symptoms of IPF include shortness of breath, especially with physical activity, dry, hacking cough, fatigue, and weight loss. The major risk factors associated with IPF are advancing\nage, smoking, and exposure to environmental irritants. Though a direct genetic link has not been identified, IPF does seem to have a hereditary basis. The prognosis for IPF is generally poor. Median survival time from the time of\ndiagnosis is 2 to 5 years. Treatment typically includes oxygen therapy and medications such as corticosteroids (prednisone) or immunomodulators.",

Bronchogenic carcinoma most commonly occurs in smokers in their fifth to sixth decades of life. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke,\nradon, or asbestos, and family history of lung cancer. Treatment generally includes surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted pharmacologic therapy, and immunotherapy. The treatment of choice is dependent on the\nstage and type of cancer as well as the patient's ability to tolerate invasive treatments. Early detection and treatment are paramount as prognosis in advanced stage disease has a 5-year survival rate of less than 15%. Diagnosis is\nmade via chest x-ray, CT scan, PET scan, and biopsy. Histologic examination is required for definitive confirmation.",

It is a hereditary disease resulting from deleterious mutations in SERPINAT7, which is located on the long arm of chromosome 14\nand encodes a,-antitrypsin. The mutation is inherited in an autosomal codominant fashion. a4-Antitrypsin is a protease inhibitor that decreases the activity of various proteases, including neutrophil elastase. Defective a4-antitrypsin\nfunction results in increased proteolytic degradation of alveolar septae in the lung parenchyma, resulting in panacinar emphysema. Panacinar emphysema is characterized by emphysematous destructive changes of pulmonary\nalveolar tissue beginning in bilateral lung bases resulting in bullous changes of the lungs, with the potential to spread diffusely. Hepatic damage occurs via a different mechanism and results from accumulation of misfolded a4-\nantitrypsin within hepatocytes. This results in hepatocyte injury and progression to cirrhosis at a young age. In patients with a,-antitrypsin deficiency, the development of both cirrhosis and panacinar emphysema can occur without\nsignificant additional risk factors for each disease.

Central diabetes insipidus may result from head trauma or surgery, as in this case. It is characterized by\ninadequate secretion of ADH (vasopressin) from the posterior pituitary. ADH typically binds V> receptors of the late distal convoluted tubule and the collecting tubule principal cells, which results in the insertion of aquaporin\nchannels in the luminal surface. This results in increased free-water absorption and is typically used to maintain tight regulation of serum osmolality. Inadequate production of ADH by the posterior pituitary gland (ie, central diabetes\ninsipidus) may occur in the setting of various pathologies, such as pituitary tumors, trauma, tuberculosis, or intracranial surgery. This results in a decreased concentration of aquaporin channels inserted within the principal cells of\nthe collecting tubule, leading to an inability to absorb adequate amounts of free water, which results in dilute urine and increased serum osmolality. Diabetes insipidus can also be of peripheral cause, such as a lack of response to\nADH by the kidney tubular cells. Patients typically present with the production of large volumes of dilute urine, hypernatremia, and altered mental status. Treatment of central diabetes insipidus is with desmopressin therapy, an\nanalog of ADH, which results in recovery of free water via aquaporin insertion in the collecting tubule.",

This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following pregnancy complications?\n\nA) Abruptio placentae\n\nB) Congenital heart block\n\nC) Fetal macrosomia\n\nD) Neural tube defect\nCorrect Answer: E.\nThis patient is at greatest risk for oligohydramnios, which describes an inadequate amount of amniotic fluid or a low amniotic fluid index. The reduced amniotic fluid volume leads to impaired lung development in the fetus, physical\ndeformities or growth restriction of the newborn as a result of amniotic sac constriction, and umbilical cord compression leading to variable decelerations on fetal heart rate monitoring. While oligohydramnios can result from prelabor\nrupture of membranes, fetal infection, post-term pregnancy, changes in maternal fetal circulation that lead to uteroplacental insufficiency, or congenital malformations of the fetal genitourinary tract (eg, posterior urethral valves or\nrenal agenesis), it can also occur as the result of a teratogen, such as maternal use of ACE inhibitors (eg, lisinopril). Lisinopril is a first-line medication for the treatment of hypertension but is typically avoided in pregnant patients, as\nit can cause fetal hypotension with consequent kidney injury and oligo- or anuria. As amniotic fluid is largely composed of fetal urine, anuria in the fetus directly leads to oligohydramnios and its known sequelae. Therefore, this\npatient who has had her hypertension treated with lisinopril during her pregnancy is most at risk for oligohydramnios due to lisinopril’s effect on fetal kidney development.\nIncorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D.\nAbruptio placentae (Choice A) is a premature separation of the placenta from the uterine endometrium. Presenting findings include abdominal or pelvic pain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and tetanic contractions. An abnormal fetal\nheart rate may be detected, and fetal demise may occur if the abruption is large. Risk factors for its development include severe hypertension, cocaine use, and a history of a"

    "correct_explanation": "This patient's symptoms are consistent with decompression sickness (DCS). DCS can occur in a variety of situations in which the body undergoes a decrease in atmospheric pressure but is most frequently encountered in divers\nusing a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba). Scuba divers typically breathe compressed air, which is composed primarily of nitrogen (the role of other compressed breathing gases, for example helium, is beyond\nthe scope of this question). The solubility of a dissolved gas in liquid is directly dependent on the partial pressure of the gas (known as Henry’s Law of gases). For this reason, blood and other human tissues will accumulate\ndissolved nitrogen when the body is exposed to greater atmospheric pressures. Excessively rapid ascent can lead to a sudden decrease in the partial pressure of dissolved nitrogen within bodily tissues, with a corresponding\ndecrease in nitrogen solubility, allowing nitrogen bubbles to form within the bloodstream and various tissues. Formation of nitrogen bubbles during decompression is the underlying cause of the majority of the symptoms of DCS. The\nrisk for DCS increases with faster rates of ascent (failure to follow dive tables or adhere to safety stops), deeper maximum depth or greater time spent at depth, repetitive dives, or flying to altitude shortly after diving. Signs and\nsymptoms of DCS can include musculocutaneous (rash, pruritus, joint pain), cardiopulmonary (chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis), gastrointestinal (abdominal pain), or neurologic findings (altered mental status, obtundation,\nheadache, visual field deficits, scotomata, focal motor or sensory deficits). The central nervous system can be affected by ischemic stroke or spinal cord infarction, particularly in the setting of patent foramen ovale, which allows\npassage of nitrogen gas emboli into the arterial circulation. The diagnosis is clinical. The treatment of DCS is supportive with immediate recompression with hyperbaric oxygen, as well as analgesia and intravenous fluids. A diver\nwho is suspected of DCS should be administered normobaric oxygen via nasal cannula until a recompression chamber can be reached. Recompression in the water is extremely dangerous and should not be attempted. Many\nsymptoms of DCS are reversible, but severe neurologic injury may be permanent.",

Acommon form of error\nresults from limitations in the number of study participants, which in turn limits statistical power, the ability of the study to detect a difference between groups if one exists. When the power of a study is increased, the incidence of a\ntype Il error decreases. A type II error occurs when a study demonstrates no difference between the null and alternative hypotheses, when in fact, a difference exists.

A meta-analysis is a form of study in which statistical analysis is performed to combine the results of multiple studies addressing the same question. Meta-analysis is useful for overcoming limitations of the constituent\nstudies. By pooling the results of multiple studies, meta-analyses reduce the risk of type II error because of the smaller sample sizes within each constituent randomized controlled trial. However, meta-analyses are susceptible to\ntheir own errors, primarily related to inclusion criteria, statistical methods, and the errors of constituent studies. The meta-analysis in this example provides a forest plot, which is a commonly used method of summarizing the results\nof multiple studies in a single graphical representation.

B-hCG is detected with\nurine and serum pregnancy tests, while ultrasonography can be used to confirm an intrauterine pregnancy. In a normal pregnancy, an intrauterine gestational sac should be visible by 5 weeks gestational age on transvaginal\nultrasonography, or when the B-hCG concentration exceeds 1000 to 2000 mIU/mL. Additional symptoms in early pregnancy include the mild abdominal cramping and urinary frequency seen in this patient, as well as nausea, breast\ntenderness, and fatigue. Dating a pregnancy based on patient history is often unreliable, as mild vaginal bleeding or spotting that is normal early in pregnancy can be mistaken for menstruation. Thus, ultrasonography is not only\nused to confirm an intrauterine pregnancy but also to establish the gestational age of the fetus.",

    "correct_explanation": "Pain caused by cancer is associated with significant limitations in functional status and quality of life. Opioids are potent analgesics that reduce the sensation of pain via delta, kappa, and particularly mu opioid receptor agonism\nthroughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Despite their potential for opioid use disorder and overdose death, opioid agonists are useful for the management of pain in certain situations, such as in the perioperative\nperiod, following trauma, and in the setting of cancer, which can produce severe, chronic pain that is often intractable to other modalities. The World Health Organization has outlined a framework, known as the analgesic ladder, to\nguide escalating pain management strategies in cancer patients. Within this framework, initial management of mild pain is with nonopioid medications and adjuvant therapies. Moderate pain is treated with oral opioids, typically\nadministered on a fixed, scheduled dose. More severe pain is managed by increasing the dosage or frequency of oral opioids, or by switching to intravenous opioids. Opioid dosage often needs to be increased due to progression of\nmetastatic disease, as well as the development of opioid tolerance. The final step within the analgesic ladder involves invasive or minimally invasive procedures to achieve analgesia, such as nerve blocks, ablative procedures, or\nintrathecal or epidural analgesia. This patient presents with an acute fracture of the left humerus, likely due to metastatic disease. This patient is already taking a high dose of scheduled hydrocodone-acetaminophen for her body\nweight, and therefore switching to intravenous morphine is the most appropriate next step in pain management. Morphine is an opioid analgesic used to manage moderate-to-severe pain and can be administered orally or\nintravenously. It is a potent analgesic that would be effective in treating pain in this patient who presents with an acute fracture.",

HUS is typically seen in children and is often caused by infection with Shiga\ntoxin-producing Escherichia coli (0157:H7), which is usually accompanied by bloody diarrhea. There are also atypical variants of HUS, which are not preceded by a diarrheal illness and are the result of mutations in the complement\nsystem (eg, mutations of C3 and CD46). Widespread microvascular thrombosis consumes platelets and predisposes circulating erythrocytes to shearing forces as a result of a disrupted vascular lumen. When erythrocytes come\ninto contact with microvascular clots, they are damaged, resulting in schistocytes, which are apparent on peripheral blood smear as fragmented cells. Thrombosis also occurs in the kidney vasculature due to underlying endothelial\ndamage, resulting in kidney injury. Differentiating HUS from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is important and can be done by examining the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time (normal in HUS and increased in\nDIC as a result of clotting factor consumption). Treatment of HUS is supportive, although eculizumab, a human monoclonal IgG antibody against complement protein C5 that prevents formation of the membrane attack complex, has\nbeen used in refractory cases.

    "correct_explanation": "Aortic stenosis is a common disorder of the aortic valve that results from fibrosis and calcification. These changes of the aortic valve are a pathologic consequence of mechanical stresses on the heart valves and result from\nrepetitive microtrauma from the opening and closing of valve leaflets with associated chronic inflammation. Many people will develop some degree of aortic stenosis over time, but structural abnormalities of the valve, such as a\nbicuspid aortic valve, alter the biomechanics of valve opening and closing and increase the likelihood of earlier fibrosis and calcification with consequent stenosis. While many patients may be asymptomatic, those with severe aortic\nstenosis may experience fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, diminished exercise tolerance, angina, or syncope with exertion. Cardiac examination will disclose a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the upper\nright sternal border with radiation to the carotids, and pulsus parvus et tardus (weak and delayed) may be noted on examination of peripheral pulses. The murmur of aortic stenosis decreases in intensity with increasing afterload\n(eg, hand grip) and decreasing preload (eg, Valsalva maneuver), and increases in intensity with increased preload (eg, squatting).",

    "correct_explanation": "This patient with hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and jugular venous distension after penetrating trauma likely has cardiac tamponade secondary to ventricular injury. Cardiac tamponade is characterized by rapid accumulation of\nblood or fluid in the pericardial space that prevents diastolic filling of the cardiac chambers, leading to low cardiac output due to low stroke volume. The speed of accumulation is important in the pathophysiology of tamponade in\nthat gradual accumulation (eg, in states of malignancy or tuberculosis) permits stretching and expansion of the parietal pericardium without necessarily impairing chamber expansion. In cases of hemodynamic instability when the\npretest probability of the condition is high, the pericardial space should be decompressed without delay. This is accomplished via pericardiocentesis, in which a large needle or angiocatheter is inserted into the pericardial space via\na subxiphoid or parasternal approach to evacuate the fluid or blood and permit chamber expansion. Echocardiography permits visualization of the heart and its chambers, and in cases of tamponade, will show a pericardial effusion\nof variable size, with right ventricular collapse during diastole. In general, the patient in this case may receive bedside emergency echocardiography while preparing for pericardiocentesis, but imaging should not delay intervention\nin an unstable patient (as in this case). After initial stabilization with pericardiocentesis, the patient should be emergently taken to the operating room for open sternotomy or thoracotomy and definitive repair of any cardiac defects.",

The diagnosis is often based on history and physical examination, although ancillary tests such as measurement of cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin concentrations may be done to aid in evaluation.\nRisk factors for its occurrence include a personal history of preterm delivery, previous cervical surgery or dilatation and curettage, a shortened cervix, extremes of age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, multiple gestations, tobacco\nuse, and maternal malnutrition, among numerous other factors. In patients at high risk for preterm labor, prophylaxis is often accomplished with intravaginal progesterone supplementation in addition to treating any underlying risk\nfactors.

Her grades have declined from mostly B’s to C’s and D’s, and she has stopped participating in sports. The patient says\nshe is tired and does not sleep; her parents report she is sleeping more than usual.

As the air accumulates\nwithin the space, the lung parenchyma becomes compressed, resulting in respiratory distress, decreased breath sounds, hyperresonance to percussion, and in severe cases, tension on the mediastinal structures impeding venous\nreturn resulting in hypotension. Signs of tension pneumothorax include tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxia, jugular venous distension, and tracheal deviation. However, in this patient with bilateral pneumothoraces, tracheal deviation\nis not observed. In cases of acute tension pneumothorax, evacuating the accumulated air via needle decompression and aspiration permits expansion of the lung and eliminates tension on the great vessels. Needle decompression\nis followed by tube thoracostomy, which prevents re-accumulation and promotes repair of the pleural defect. In a case of bilateral pneumothoraces, respiratory failure will occur imminently, especially once closed pneumothoraces\nare converted to open pneumothoraces during needle decompression. Eliminating a pressure gradient across the thoracic wall requires the immediate need for tube thoracostomy and negative pressure, otherwise ventilatory failure\nand respiratory arrest will rapidly ensue.",

This patient should discontinue naproxen because of her increased serum creatinine concentration. Use\nof NSAIDs can precipitate acute kidney injury or progression of chronic kidney disease. NSAIDs such as naproxen are inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which have a primary role in the synthesis of prostaglandins and\nprostacyclins. These molecules modulate pain sensation and thermoregulation, maintain the gastric mucosal barrier, and regulate renal blood flow (RBF). If NSAID use occurs at higher doses, with more potent agents, or over a\nprolonged time, acute kidney injury can occur due to deficiency in prostaglandins that would otherwise promote maintenance of RBF. Acute kidney injury sustained in this manner is especially likely if high-risk NSAID use is\naccompanied by RBF-limiting pre-renal insults such as volume depletion or in the presence of other nephrotoxins. In a patient with chronic kidney disease, progression of disease can occur. NSAIDs are associated with renal\npapillary necrosis, which is the sloughing and necrosis of renal papillae leading to gross hematuria and proteinuria. NSAIDs are also associated with acute interstitial nephritis, which is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to\nmedications (eg, NSAIDs, diuretics, sulfonamides) and is characterized by a rash, azotemia, sterile pyuria, hematuria, and eosinophiluria.

By convention, the dose of an opioid is converted to its\nmorphine equivalent dose, allowing for comparison of and conversion between opioids of different potencies. Hydromorphone is a mu opioid agonist that is effective for moderate-to-severe cancer pain and is available in\nintravenous or oral formulations. Oral hydromorphone is approximately four times as potent as oral morphine, such that 7.5 mg of oral hydromorphone provides an equivalent dose to 30 mg of oral morphine. Oral hydromorphone is\nalso less potent than intravenous hydromorphone, and approximately 5 mg of oral hydromorphone should be given for each 1 mg of intravenous hydromorphone when converting from intravenous to oral dosing to provide an\nequianalgesic dose. Special caution should be used when switching between agents due to cross-tolerance, and it is common to start a new opioid agent at a reduced equianalgesic dose initially and then to titrate the dose upwards\nbased on clinical response and tolerability. This patient has been transitioned from intravenous hydromorphone to oral hydromorphone at the same dose. Given the reduced potency of oral hydromorphone, he is likely experiencing\ninadequate analgesia and should have his dose of oral hydromorphone adjusted accordingly.",

    "correct_explanation": "Pain caused by cancer is associated with significant limitations in functional status and quality of life. The World Health Organization has outlined a strategy, known as the analgesic ladder, to guide escalating pain management\nstrategies in cancer patients. Within this framework, initial management is with non-opioid medications and adjuvant therapies, followed by addition of opioids for more severe pain. Opioid dosage often needs to be increased due to\nprogression of metastatic disease, as well as the development of opioid tolerance. Cancer patients often experience pain that is refractory to treatment with opioids. The final step within the analgesic ladder involves invasive or\nminimally invasive procedures to achieve analgesia, such as nerve blocks, ablative procedures, or intrathecal or epidural analgesia. Celiac plexus blockade is an effective, minimally invasive pain management approach for patients\nwith pain caused by pancreatic cancer that is refractory to high-dose opioids. The celiac plexus is located within the retroperitoneal space on the anterolateral surface of the aorta near the origin of the celiac trunk. It provides\nautonomic and nociceptive innervation to the liver, gallbladder, stomach, pancreas, spleen, small bowel, proximal large bowel, and kidneys. The blockade is performed by injection of alcohol under fluoroscopic guidance, resulting in\nneurolysis and effective pain control in most patients.",

Narcolepsy arises from deficient production of orexins in the\nhypothalamus, which may result from genetic or autoimmune causes. Orexins typically induce the secretion of monoamines, such as norepinephrine, throughout the brain to promote wakefulness. As a result, patients suddenly and\ninappropriately transition into sleep during the day. Additionally, REM sleep features (eg, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis) occur during wakefulness. Cataplexy refers to a sudden loss of muscle tone and\nusually occurs in response to positive emotion. The clinical diagnosis should be confirmed by a polysomnogram to confirm the rapid transition into REM sleep and rule out other causes of daytime sleepiness, as well as a multiple\nsleep latency test to confirm decreased sleep latency. Treatment includes maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoidance of daytime naps, and in patients with severe daytime sleepiness, modafinil.

Hyperthyroidism most commonly presents as it did in this patient, with heat intolerance, agitation, diarrhea, weight loss, tachycardia,\npalpitations, and tremor. The most common cause in both pregnant and nonpregnant patients is Graves disease, which is caused by an antibody to the TSH receptor, leading to its activation and the production of increased thyroid\nhormones. Pregnancy itself is also associated with increased thyroid hormones, due to stimulation of the thyroid by B-hCG and due to an increased production of thyroid-binding globulin. This leads to overall high concentrations of\ntotal triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), but not to increased free hormone concentrations. Thus, diagnosis is made with evaluation of TSH concentrations, which would be expected to be low, and free T, concentrations, which\nwould be expected to be high. Complications of untreated maternal hyperthyroidism include abnormalities in the neonatal thyroid function, spontaneous abortion, premature labor, preeclampsia, and a small-for-gestational-age\nnewborn. Treatment often consists of symptomatic management with a short course of B-adrenergic blockers and disease management with propylthiouracil or methimazole. Propylthiouracil is the preferred agent in the first\ntrimester, as it is associated with less teratogenicity than methimazole, which has been linked to omphalocele, tracheoesophageal fistulas, and choanal atresia in the newborn.

As a\nresult of decreased CaSR activity, the parathyroid gland is rendered insensitive to normal or increased serum calcium and inappropriately releases parathyroid hormone (PTH) in order to respond to falsely perceived hypocalcemia.\nThis leads to increased osteoclastic bone resorption, increased gastrointestinal calcium absorption, increased renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and magnesium, and increased renal loss of phosphate. Patients are typically\nasymptomatic or have mild symptoms of hypercalcemia, including fatigue, headache, abdominal pain, or constipation. Patients may rarely have pancreatitis as a result of abnormal pancreatic calcifications. The diagnosis is\nestablished with genetic testing of the CASR gene. 24-Hour urine calcium excretion of less than 100 mg supports the diagnosis. Laboratory studies typically show mild hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and\nhypocalciuria. There is often a family history of hypercalcemia.

The first steps in managing such patients are to assess the airway,\nbreathing, and circulation, along with immobilization of cervical spine until further examinations can be performed. Management after initial survey is dependent on any concerning findings such as airway compromise, respiratory\nsuppression, or circulatory dysfunction. In this patient, who was being held by a family member in the front seat of a vehicle in which the airbags deployed during collision, it is fair to assume that the patient was struck by the airbag.\nOn arrival, this patient is mildly tachycardic and mildly tachypneic, though for his age such vital signs may be appropriate. At the time of assessment, there is no clear indication of a primary survey related immediate life threat; thus,\nhe does not require immediate intervention prior to further diagnosis. His spine was immobilized with a cervical collar and backboard on scene. The most appropriate next step, given his stable presentation, is to assess integrity of\nstructures in the cervical spine and thorax, as these are most likely to be damaged due to airbag deployment. This is also particularly important for this patient because there are abrasions over his face and neck, again giving\nevidence for airbag contact. If this patient were to have respiratory collapse from resultant laryngeal or tracheal injury, intubation would be necessary to maintain the patient’s airway. However, if a cervical spine fracture was not\nidentified prior to this, there is an increased possibility of spinal cord injury during intubation. Notably, x-rays have limited sensitivity for pediatric blunt traumatic injury; bony structures are not yet fully ossified at age 2 years.\nAdvanced studies such as CT scan or MRI may be necessary depending on the clinical presentation, though x-ray imaging is an appropriate first choice.",

As women age, their ovarian reserve is depleted and they have fewer ovulatory cycles until\nmenstruation stops completely, referred to as menopause, which typically begins around age 50 years. Menopause is characterized by the lack of ovarian estrogen production, resulting in manifestations such as vaginal atrophy, hot\nflashes, and night sweats. Sleep disturbances and mood changes may also be present. In response to decreased estrogen concentrations, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) lack negative feedback\nand are increased in the serum. Menopause is often a clinical diagnosis, but these laboratory values may be obtained if the diagnosis is unclear. Because many of the symptoms of menopause are caused by a deficiency of\nestrogen, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen (either with or without progesterone) mitigates many of the adverse effects of menopause. While HRT has been attributed to an increased risk for breast cancer,\nhypercoagulability, and cardiovascular mortality, it is generally considered safe for a limited period of time at the lowest effective dose in patients who are otherwise healthy or at average risk for cardiovascular disease.

    "correct_explanation": "Acute glaucoma refers to an increase in intraocular pressure and consequent optic nerve damage. Angle closure is the most common cause of acute glaucoma, whereas open-angle glaucoma is typically a chronic and progressive\noptic neuropathy. The closure of the anterior chamber angle leads to the sudden accumulation of aqueous humor in the eyeball as well as increased intraocular pressure. Some patients’ eyes are anatomically predisposed to acute\nangle closure (eg, lens is too far forward and puts pressure on the iris), as is likely the case for this patient. Secondary causes of acute glaucoma include sulfa-based medications (eg, topiramate) and the accumulation of blood or\ninflammation in the angle. Patients typically present with acute unilateral vision loss (as in this case), eye pain, light halos, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Ocular examination commonly shows a red eye, corneal cloudiness, and\na poorly reactive mid-dilated pupil. A high cup:disc ratio (greater than 7:10) is consistent with glaucoma. Gonioscopy, which assists in visualizing the angle closure, confirms the diagnosis. Management involves acute control with\nbeta blockers, a-adrenergic agonists, miosis-causing medications, and acetazolamide or mannitol to decrease the intraocular pressure. Definitive treatment is laser peripheral iridotomy or cataract surgery.",

    "correct_explanation": "This infant with difficulty feeding, hypoxia, and a “boot-shaped” heart on chest x-ray has a presentation suggestive of tetralogy of Fallot. Tetralogy of Fallot consists of pulmonary infundibular stenosis, overriding aorta, ventricular\nseptal defect (VSD), and right ventricular hypertrophy, resulting in a right-to-left shunt with cyanosis first noted in infancy. Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction eventually leads to right ventricular hypertrophy. The\nmurmur heard with tetralogy of Fallot, which is typically a holosystolic murmur best heard in the left lower sternal border, is caused by RVOT obstruction, not as often by the VSD. Paroxysmal cyanosis that occurs during periods of\ncrying is a classic presentation, and these episodes are referred to as “tet” spells. Patients amid one of these spells often exhibit rapid, deep breathing, agitation, and progressive cyanosis. These periods of cyanosis occur becaus\nof transient obstruction or occlusion of the RVOT leading to decreased blood flow through the pulmonary circulation, although the cause of the underlying transient obstruction is unclear. Treatment of tetralogy of Fallot is with\noperative repair, which aims to relieve the RVOT obstruction, close the VSD, and separate the pulmonary and systemic circulation. The procedure is usually performed in the first 6 months of life and almost always within the first\nyear.",

While there are numerous causes of acute pancreatitis, the most\ncommon nontraumatic causes include gallstones and heavy alcohol consumption. Gallstones form in the setting of lithogenic bile and may subsequently pass out of the gallbladder through the cystic duct and eventually reach the\ncommon bile duct. The main pancreatic duct also connects to the distal common bile duct, which is a conduit for pancreatic enzymes to reach the duodenum. If gallstones become lodged in the distal aspect of the common bile\nduct, obstruction of pancreatic flow can lead to the release and activation of pancreatic enzymes within the pancreas, which causes substantial inflammation and pain. Additionally, as the flow of bile toward the duodenum is\nobstructed, patients can develop hyperbilirubinemia and increased liver enzymes. CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is often performed as a diagnostic step to evaluate for pancreatitis or other underlying causes of abdominal\npain.

Thiamine deficiency results in neuronal damage through a mechanism that likely\ninvolves oxidative toxicity. Thiamine deficiency is most commonly encountered in the setting of alcohol use disorder because of poor nutritional intake, thiamine malabsorption, and impaired cellular utilization of thiamine. Thiamine\ndeficiency causes two potential syndromes: Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff dementia. The classic triad of Wernicke encephalopathy consists of encephalopathy, ataxia, and oculomotor dysfunction as a result of neuronal\ndamage in the cerebellum, midbrain, and pons. Common ocular manifestations include nystagmus and horizontal gaze palsy caused by damage to the abducens nuclei. Over time, thiamine deficiency can result in damage and\natrophy of the mammillary bodies, visible on MRI of the brain, which manifests as Wernicke encephalopathy. The symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy are reversible but increase the risk for developing Wernicke-Korsakoff\nsyndrome in chronic alcohol users if not immediately treated with high-dose parenteral thiamine. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is an irreversible condition that features psychosis, anterograde and retrograde amnesia, and the\nconsequent tendency to confabulate, or verbalize false stories or memories, to compensate for the inability to remember. This patient presents with classic findings of Wernicke encephalopathy and should be treated with immediate\nadministration of parenteral thiamine.",

Asthma often presents with episodic wheezing and shortness of breath with or without a cough, but it can also present with an isolated cough.\nPatients should be assessed for other atopic symptoms such as allergic rhinitis or eczema as these conditions commonly occur in conjunction with asthma. Other causes of chronic cough include gastroesophageal reflux disease\nand rhinosinusitis. Patients in whom asthma is suspected should undergo spirometry with measurement of FEV, and FVC. As asthma is a reversible and episodic condition, spirometry is frequently normal unless the patient is\nexhibiting symptoms at or around the time of spirometry. Therefore, most patients undergo a methacholine challenge test. Methacholine is a potent stimulator of bronchoconstriction, and as asthma is defined by airway\nhyperreactivity, patients with asthma tend to experience bronchospasm at lower doses of methacholine than patients without asthma. An improvement in FEV, by at least 12% with bronchodilators is diagnostic of asthma. Treatment\ndepends on the severity but may include short-acting bronchodilators and/or inhaled corticosteroids. In general, diagnoses of asthma are not made prior to 2 to 3 years of age. Infants cough and wheeze for many reasons and\nknowing whether primary airway hyperreactivity (a feature of asthma) is present is challenging, as infants are generally not able to perform pulmonary function testing.

Diabetic nephropathy is a chronic process that occurs following nonenzymatic glycosylation of the glomerular basement membrane and efferent\narterioles, characteristically demonstrating Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions on light microscopy. It progresses over time in patients with diabetes mellitus, initially beginning as microalbuminuria, which can subsequently lead to\nmacroalbuminuria and then end-stage kidney disease. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is commonly a result of chronic hypocalcemia in the setting of end-stage kidney disease. Hypocalcemia in end-stage kidney disease occurs\nas a result of decreased native kidney production of calcitriol (also known as active vitamin D), which leads to decreased systemic absorption of calcium, and an increased concentration of phosphate because of retention by the\nkidney. Increased phosphate also complexes with calcium in serum, decreasing the serum total calcium concentration. In patients with chronic kidney disease, 1a-hydroxylase activity is decreased, and thus, calcitriol\nconcentration is decreased. In turn, hypocalcemia is sensed by the normally functioning parathyroid gland, which increases synthesis of parathyroid hormone to attempt to normalize serum calcium concentration through\nosteolysis, conversion of vitamin D, and gastrointestinal absorption.",

Metabolic alkalosis can occur from acute hypovolemia, gastrointestinal losses of hydrogen ions, administration of alkali, states of increased\naldosterone, use of loop or thiazide diuretics, Bartter or Gitelman syndrome, or in milk-alkali syndrome due to renal losses of hydrogen ions. Hypoventilation may occur in order to retain COp. This clinical scenario would be\nidentifiable by an increased serum HCO3° with an increased Pcog. This patient’s arterial blood gas results are not consistent with this diagnosis.\nPure respiratory acidosis (Choice D) occurs as a result of diminished ventilation and retention of acidic COj, most commonly from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, sleep apnea,\nor following the use or overdose of sedatives. This would be identifiable by a pH of less than 7.35 (acidemia), increased Pcoz and normal HCO3-. This patient’s decreased HCO3” suggests an additional metabolic acid-base\ndisturbance.\nRespiratory acidosis with a compensatory metabolic alkalosis (Choice E) would be indicated by a high Pcoz and high HCO3-.

Asthma often presents with episodic exacerbations that can be triggered by an allergen or other\nenvironmental exposures, exercise, or seasonal changes. Asthma exacerbations present with shortness of breath, cough, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, wheezing, and hypoxemia in severe cases. A variety of acid-base\ndisturbances can occur in the setting of asthma. Mild asthma exacerbations may lead to hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis.

Most infants with this condition are asymptomatic. Genetic causes may involve\nabnormalities in expression of FGF and TGF.

The resulting deformity can\nbe both cosmetic (abnormal head shape) and pathologic (limiting normal central nervous system growth). Several patterns of deformity can occur depending on which sutures prematurely fuse. In this patient, fusion of the\ncoronal suture arrests the anterior-posterior growth of the skull. This leads to continued medial-lateral growth in disproportion to anterior-posterior direction. As a result, anterior plagiocephaly or brachycephaly can develop.

In contrast, when\npatients present with disseminated infection, there are often no proceeding symptoms suggesting a sexually transmitted infection. These patients present with fevers, malaise, polyarthritis or oligoarthritis, tenosynovitis, and\nvesiculopustular dermatitis. They may also present solely with purulent arthritis of one or more extremity joints (eg, knees, elbows, ankles). Evaluation of these patients with exposure to a sexually transmitted infection or with\nsymptoms of urethritis includes a Gram stain and culture of a urethral swab. In gonorrhea, organisms may not be visible on a Gram stain because N. gonorrhoeae is an intracellular organism. Cultures or nucleic acid amplification\ntesting of the urine or urethral swab often yield the diagnosis. Screening for extragenital infections with oral and rectal swabs is also recommended in nonmonogamous men who have sex with men. Testing and treatment for\ncoinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis should also occur. While testing is being completed, patients with a known exposure to a sexually transmitted infection should be treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy. Treatment often\nconsists of intramuscular ceftriaxone, as well as azithromycin or doxycycline to treat a potential concurrent chlamydia infection.",

He has not had fever, chills, weight loss, or intolerance to fatty food.\nOver-the-counter famotidine has provided minimal relief. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is\n120/82 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows epigastric tenderness to palpation. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Test of the stool for occult blood is positive. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy\nshows a 1.5-cm ulcer along the lesser curvature of the stomach; there is no active bleeding. Biopsy results are shown. Smoking cessation is recommended. In addition to lansoprazole therapy, which of the following is the\nmost appropriate pharmacotherapy?",

    "correct_explanation": "Peptic ulcer disease is the presence of ulcers in the stomach or duodenum, which typically present with worsening abdominal pain related to the consumption (ie, gastric) or lack of consumption (ie, duodenal) of food. Peptic ulcer\ndisease is strongly associated with infection from the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. Persistent inflammation related to a peptic ulcer can result in complications, including fibrosis, stricture, hemorrhage, and perforation.\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy of a peptic ulcer is a sensitive and specific method for diagnosing an H. pylori infection and observing signs of inflammation. As seen in the photomicrograph, H. pylori organisms appear\nas short, spiral-shaped bacteria in the gastric mucosa. Eradication therapy using a triple or quadruple combined therapy can eliminate the bacterium and permit healing of the peptic ulcer, generally with few complications if\nmanaged promptly. In addition to a proton pump inhibitor, such as lansoprazole, treatment of H. pylori infection should include two antibiotics to reduce the risk for treatment failure. Typically, the antibiotics chosen include\nclarithromycin and amoxicillin.",

    "correct_explanation": "This patient's vesicular lesions are likely caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) contracted during his vaginal delivery. Treatment with antivirals would prevent the development of herpes encephalitis. This patient's mother most\nlikely had an unrecognized genital herpes infection, which often presents with painful vesicles in the genital area (eg, vulva, vagina, cervix, perineum) and associated symptoms of fevers, chills, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Most\ncases of genital herpes are caused by HSV-2; however, HSV-1 has also been associated with genital herpes infection. In pregnant patients, the infection may pass to the newborn during delivery secondary to an ascending infection\nfollowing spontaneous rupture of membranes or from passage through the infected lower genital tract. To prevent this intrapartum transmission of infection, acyclovir can be used to suppress outbreaks. A cesarean delivery is\nrequired if herpetic lesions or symptoms are present on the cervix, vagina, or vulva at the time of labor. Common neonatal complications include vesicular skin lesions and ocular involvement, whereas neonatal encephalitis is a\nsevere complication of the infection. Herpes simplex encephalitis often presents with fever, seizures, lethargy, and poor feeding. Diagnosis is made with a lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid analysis.",
