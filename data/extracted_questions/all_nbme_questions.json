Rapid electrical depolarization of the heart and resultant increased heart rate impairs diastolic filling time resulting in low cardiac output leading to hypotension. Such a condition is accompanied by the high likelihood of degeneration to ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. Any patient with an unstable, wide-complex tachycardia requires immediate synchronized cardioversion to abort the rhythm and permit improved cardiac output. Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocols are well-established for such cases; unstable patients (hypotensive, diaphoretic, tachypneic, with altered mental status) should be immediately cardioverted. Stable, perfusing wide-complex arrhythmias (normotensive, minimally symptomatic, with easily palpable pulses) can be treated with antiarrhythmic medication.

The tearing of the tunica intima and media in dissection allows for the creation of a false lumen in which blood can accumulate. Further, branch vessels can become occluded by the false lumen leading to end-organ ischemia. In older patients with a history of hypertension, atherosclerotic disease of the vasa vasorum plus breakdown of normal mural collagen and elastin results in accumulation of basophilic ground substance in place of normal tissue architecture. This process is known as cystic medial necrosis of the aorta. This process occurs predominantly in the tunica media - the smooth muscle layer of the arterial wall - and results in progressive weakening that can lead to an increased risk for thoracic aortic aneurysm formation and aortic dissection.",

Oxygen delivery is a function of cardiac output and oxygen content. If oxygen content falls, cardiac output must rise to maintain equivalent delivery.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (OKA) occurs due to the accumulation of serum ketones such as ~-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone in the setting of deficient insulin signaling. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs because of the relative state of starvation created through absent insulin signaling. Patients present with fatigue, polyuria, shortness of breath, and diffuse abdominal discomfort. Vital signs may show tachycardia and tachypnea. Kussmaul respirations, rapid and deep, is a classic physical exam finding because of respiratory compensation for the underlying metabolic acidosis . Labs typically show increased glucose, ketones, and a high anion-gap because of the accumulation of unmeasured anions in serum . Anion gap is calculated as the difference between sodium and the sum of bicarbonate and chloride anions. Treatment is through replacement of insulin, volume repletion, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions. lncorrectAnswers: B, C, D, and E. Accumulation of lactate (Choice B), also known as lactic acidosis, can occur in multiple different situations such as shock, metabolic derangements, and in response to medications. It can also occur in OKA; however, it is not the primary cause of acidosis . Decreased renal production of ammonium (Choice C) and loss of bicarbonate through the kidneys (Choice D) are both causes of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). RTAs are not caused by the accumulation of an unmeasured anion and do not present with an increased anion gap. Movement of potassium into the cells (Choice E) occurs because of transcellular potassium-proton exchange . Increased movement of potassium into the cells occurs when the serum is alkalotic, not acidotic. Acidosis in the setting of OKA stimulates movement of potassium out of the cells into the serum. ,. \"' , r-- r ,,,",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Dizziness and gait instability carry a broad differential diagnosis; these symptoms are often divided into central, peripheral, and secondary causes of symptoms to determine a likely diagnosis. Central causes include cerebrovascular accidents such as ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, tumors of the brain stem and cerebellum, infarction involving the vestibulocochlear nerve, and multiple sclerosis or similar demyelinating disorders. Peripheral causes include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, labyrinthitis, Meniere disease, endolymphatic fistula, or temporal bone fractures, tumors, or lesions. Secondary or systemic causes can include electrolyte imbalances, hypovolemia, cardiac arrhythmia, infections, and vitamin deficiencies, among other causes. Labyrinthitis is inflammation of the inner ear, often involving the vestibulocochlear nerve, and is often preceded by an upper respiratory or ear infection. Classic symptoms include vertigo, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hearing loss. Treatment is supportive, along with the exclusion of emergent causes of vertigo and ataxia, as the condition is typically self-limited. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) (Choice A) is a known cause of central vertigo secondary to impingement of the vestibulocochlear nerve at the brain stem. These tumors often occur at the cerebellopontine angle and are often subclinical; there is an association with neurofibromatosis, and they may present with hearing loss, vertigo, and nystagmus. Preceding infection or dulling of the tympanic membranes would not be expected. Cerebral infarction (Choice B) can cause vertigo by disrupting normal neurologic equilibrium and proprioceptive pathways, especially when such infarction involves the cerebellum, pons, or brain stem nuclei involving the oculomotor, trochlear, abducens, or vestibulocochlear nerves. Nystagmus, motor or sensory neurologic deficits, and cranial nerve deficits would be expected in such cases, and the presentation is typically acute. Signs of vertebrobasilar insufficiency, such as nausea, vomiting, dysarthria, and impaired brain stem reflexes may also be present. Dehydration (Choice C) may present with dizziness or ataxia in the setting of orthostatic hypotension, with patients often describing feelings of light-headedness when rising from supine to seated or seated to standing. It is caused by decreased cardiac output from diminished preload and resolves with volume resuscitation. Endocarditis (Choice D) presents with acute or subacute fever, a new or changing heart murmur, septic emboli to the lung or systemic circulation, and vascular and immunologic phenomena such as Roth spots, Osler nodes, Janeway lesions, and splinter hemorrhages. Multiple sclerosis (MS) (Choice F) presents with neurologic symptoms of varying duration separated in space and time. Common symptoms include optic neuritis, which is often the declaring presentation. Women are more commonly affected than men. Any type of neurologic symptom may occur. MS would not be expected to follow an infection though it may be exacerbated by such, and physical exam findings of tympanic membrane dullness (suggestive of inflammation and fluid in the middle ear) would not be present. r-- r \" , r ,",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Shortness of breath, edema, jugular venous distention (JVD), crackles in dependent areas of lung, a history of poorly controlled hypertension, tachypnea, tachycardia, and an x-ray showing cardiomegaly with cephalization of vessels raises suspicion for cardiogenic pulmonary edema because of increased pressures in the left side of the heart, pulmonary veins, and pulmonary capillaries. Pulmonary edema can also occur from non-cardiogenic sources (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome, multifocal pneumonia, burns/inhalation injuries, high altitude, and drowning). Because of increased left-heart filling pressures in heart failure, the pulmonary venous pressure rises, which in turn results in increased pressures in pulmonary capillaries. This increased hydrostatic pressure results in interstitial edema and eventually alveolar edema. This is seen clinically as shortness of breath and respiratory distress and is supported by signs of hypervolemia such as peripheral edema, JVD, S gallop, and crackles on lung examination. Vital signs typically show tachycardia, 3 hypertension, tachypnea, and hypoxia. Treatment is through diuresis to reduce the patient's hypervolemic state and lower cardiac filling pressure, pulmonary venous, and pulmonary capillary pressure. Nitroglycerin, a venodilator, can also be utilized to shift fluid into capacitance vessels and lower preload. Positive pressure ventilation can also reduce alveolar and interstitial edema and drive fluid back into circulation. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. Aspiration pneumonia (Choice A) presents as shortness of breath, cough productive of sputum, and fever, with a focal consolidation on chest x-ray, often in the superior segment of the inferior right lobe of lung. This is the most common location for an aspiration event to occur when a patient is supine. An aspiration event must be in the history to diagnose aspiration pneumonia; thus, the patient will often have a history of swallowing dysfunction, stroke, oropharyngeal or laryngeal malignancy, or a condition that causes frequent vomiting and retching such as alcoholism or bulimia. Bronchiectasis (Choice B) presents with signs of obstructive lung disease, and often follows chronic pulmonary necrotizing infections, which can occur in the setting of cystic fibrosis, Kartagener syndrome, or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Patients will present with wheezing and mucus plugging, and, unless concomitant right heart failure is present, would not necessarily present with signs of hypervolemia (e.g., edema, JVD). Cephalization of vessels would also be atypical, unless left heart failure were also present. Chest x-ray often shows marked bronchial dilatation and wall thickening. Chronic bronchitis (Choice C) presents with chronic productive cough and signs of obstructive lung disease (e.g., wheezing, air trapping). It often occurs in smokers as a component of the spectrum of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in tandem with emphysema. This commonly results in right heart failure from chronic hypoxemic pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction. This would potentially manifest with JVD, ascites, and lower extremity edema, less likely pulmonary edema. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (Choice D) is caused by an exaggerated immune response (typically type 3 or type 4 hypersensitivity) to an inhaled antigen. It can present in acute, subacute, or chronic forms, with the acute form characterized by shortness of breath, cough, and systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, and rash, following exposure to an antigen. The chest x-ray may be normal at this stage or may show interstitial infiltrates. The subacute and chronic forms commonly present with dyspnea, cough, fatigue, and weight loss, and imaging reveals interstitial inflammation and fibrosis of the lung. Pulmonary function tests generally demonstrate a restrictive pattern. Unless concomitant heart failure were present, signs of volume overload and cephalization of the vessels would be unlikely. Pulmonary embolism (Choice F) is characteristically associated with long periods of immobilization such as orthopaedic surgery, intensive care unit stay, long drives, and long plane flights, because of the association with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) formation from venous stasis. DVT classically presents with unilateral lower extremity edema, and when an embolus travels to the lung, the patient may become symptomatic. Classic symptoms include rapid-onset chest pain and dyspnea; if an infarction has occurred, pleuritic chest pain and hemoptysis may be present. Vital signs are often notable for tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia; hypotension can be present if the em bolus is large enough to obstruct blood flow from the right heart. The lungs are typically clear to auscultation, and cardiomegaly and cephalization of the vessels would be unlikely unless concomitant heart failure were present. r-- r \" , r ,",

Blood may also be detectable in stool from extraintestinal sources, such as swallowed blood during epistaxis. The test for occult blood is also sometimes confounded by oral iron supplementation, which can lead to false positive results. If a lower GI tract source is suspected, a colonoscopy is indicated . This allows visualization, biopsy, excision , or cautery of any suspicious lesions, which can be both diagnostic and therapeutic.

Failure to void following removal of an indwelling urinary catheter raises suspicion for post-catheter urethral inflammation with resultant acute urinary obstruction.

Urinalysis typically reveals eosinophiluria, with occasional WBC casts, increased WBC/hpf, and proteinuria. Treatment involves discontinuing the inciting agent. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, E, and F. Acute tubular necrosis often follows an ischemic or nephrotoxic insult and is commonly seen in patients with cardiac arrest following prolonged resuscitation prior to return of spontaneous circulation and in patients with prolonged cardiogenic, obstructive, distributive, or hypovolemic shock. Nephrotoxic agents such as heavy metals and myoglobin can also precipitate acute tubular necrosis. It is characterized on urinalysis by proteinuria, increased WBC/hpf, muddy brown casts, and visualized tubular epithelial cells on urine microscopy {Choice A). Choice C generally reflects a normal urinalysis, with specific gravity, glucose, protein, white and red cells, and casts all within normal limits. Choice D may reflect pyelonephritis, as WBC casts and bacteria are present. Classically, the number of white cells per high power field along with leukocyte esterase and nitrites are also increased in pyelonephritis. Nephritic syndrome typically presents with red blood cell casts and hematuria {Choice E).

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Pleural effusions are caused by multiple underlying conditions including infection such as pneumonia, malignancy such as lung cancer or mesothelioma, and increased hydrostatic pressure such as left-sided heart failure. They are clinically suspected on exam in the setting of dullness to percussion and diminished breath sounds and can be visualized on imaging including chest x-ray, CT scan, or ultrasound. Analyzing the pleural fluid can reveal an underlying cause to guide therapy. Fluid is inspected for cell counts, organisms, pH, glucose, total protein, and enzyme levels. Low pH and low glucose are indicative of increased cellular metabolism in the fluid and may indicate underlying malignancy and/or infection. Effusions can be further categorized as transudates (eg, serous fluid resulting from imbalanced hydrostatic or oncotic pressure) or exudates (eg, complex fluid resulting from pneumonia, empyema, malignancy, or inflammatory disease) using Light's criteria, which compares the pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels to those found in serum. Pneumonia can be complicated by simple parapneumonic exudative effusions, which, if sufficiently large, can compress lung parenchyma and impair respiratory mechanics. If not treated, secondary infection can occur within the pleural space leading to an empyema which requires evacuation via a chest tube or surgery in addition to continued antibiotic therapy. Empyema is characterized by an exudative effusion with increased pleural fluid leukocytes, low pH, low glucose, increased protein, and increased lactate dehydrogenase.",

If the infarction results in left ventricular dysfunction, patients may experience cardiogenic pulmonary edema resulting in shortness of breath, tachypnea, hypoxia, audible crackles, and an S or S gallop. Diagnosis is made using clinical history, analysis of cardiac biomarkers, and an ECG which may show ST-segment elevation or depression, inverted T-waves, or Q 3 4 waves. Treatment requires the use of antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel) plus anticoagulants (eg, heparin), pain control, and revascularization through angioplasty, thrombolysis, or coronary artery bypass grafting.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Mild forgetfulness without significant impairment in ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living, with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 27/30, is most consistent with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI is often seen prior to a diagnosis of dementia, especially Alzheimer type, and includes amnestic (memory-related) and non-amnestic (language, spatial, executive functional impairment) MCI with generally preserved ability to function independently without significant impairment. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Dementia, Alzheimer type (Choice A) is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - fifth edition (DSM-5) as loss of intellectual function within multiple domains: language, memory, perception, motor skills, attention, orientation, problem solving, and executive function. Presumptive diagnosis involves demonstrating cognitive impairment, often through the MMSE, excluding similar syndromes (e.g., vascular dementia, Lewy Body dementia) and secondary causes such as toxic (e.g., heavy metal poisoning), metabolic (e.g., electrolyte disturbances, uremia, hyperammonemia, vitamin deficiencies), endocrine (e.g., thyroid, adrenal, and parathyroid derangement), infectious (e.g., neurosyphilis, HIV encephalopathy, meningoencephalitis), polypharmaceutical (e.g., sedative-hypnotic and anticholinergic use), and superimposed psychiatric causes (e.g., major depressive disorder). Medication adverse effect (Choice B) is a well-recognized cause of cognitive impairment that is often reversible in elderly persons. Anticholinergics and sedative-hypnotics are frequently cited as causing depressed mental status or delirium when administered to persons with limited cognitive reserve. This patient does not clearly have an abrupt cognitive decline correlated with initiating such medications. Multi-infarct (vascular) dementia (Choice D) is characterized as a stepwise decline in cognitive functioning following vascular phenomena, for example, presenting as progressive loss of function after each cerebrovascular accident in a series of ischemic strokes. Vitamin B (cobalamin) deficiency (Choice E) presents with dementia resulting from nutritional deficiency and is often accompanied by megaloblastic anemia. 12 r-- r \" , r ,",

Symptoms include fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance, with pallor and glossitis found on physical examination.

Porphyria can arise from genetic mutations, heavy metal poisoning, and as an adverse effect of some medications. It presents with anemia, and often blistering of the skin when exposed to sunlight. Faulty protein transcription (Choice B) can cause many types of anemia; examples include sickle cell anemia and pyruvate kinase deficiency, both of which typically result in hemolytic, normocytic anemias. Inadequate erythropoietin (Choice D) occurs in chronic end-stage kidney disease because of insufficient production from the peritubular capillary interstitial cells. Without erythropoietin, progenitor cells in the bone marrow are not appropriately stimulated to produce red blood cells, resulting in the development of normocytic, non-hemolytic anemia.

These patients are more likely to aspirate gastric contents into the lung, which results in bacterial seeding with gastrointestinal or oral flora and can lead to pneumonia. Frequently, aspiration occurs in a dependent segment of the lung such as bilateral lower lobes when erect or the lingula, right middle lobe, and superior segments of the lower lobes while lying down. Pulmonary abscesses often present with low-grade fevers, weight loss, anemia, and leukocytosis. On chest x-ray, air-fluid levels are seen within the abscess cavity.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Increasing the dose of lisinopril would be the most appropriate recommendation to decrease the patient's risk for renal failure (end-stage kidney disease). Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, which inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme resulting in decreased production of angiotensin II and aldosterone. This results in reduced blood pressure by multiple mechanisms. Additionally, the decreased production of angiotensin II results in relative efferent arteriole dilatation. This leads to decreased glomerular filtration pressure. The patient demonstrates chronic hypertension, which is a leading cause of end-stage kidney disease. Increasing the dose of lisinopril will assist in further decreasing the patient's systemic blood pressure in addition to efferent arteriole dilatation, both of which will reduce intraglomerular pressure. This reduction in intraglomerular pressure will reduce damage to the glomerular capillaries and decrease her risk for end-stage kidney disease. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Protein-restricted diet (Choice A) has been shown to reduce progression of nephropathy in patients with chronic end-stage kidney disease, especially in diabetic nephropathy. This patient's risk for end-stage kidney disease is mostly related to her chronic hypertension for which increasing the dose of lisinopril would demonstrate the most benefit. 24-Hour urine collection for measurement of protein concentration (Choice B) is utilized for the evaluation of nephrotic syndrome and albuminuria for diabetic nephropathy. The patient's nephropathy is likely from chronic hypertension and her urinalysis demonstrates 1+ urine protein, which is a low-level of urine protein. Measurement of 24-hour urine protein would not further assist in her management. Switching from hydrochlorothiazide to furosemide (Choice D) would not appreciably decrease the patient's risk for end-stage kidney disease as these agents do not demonstrate reno-protective properties and are both diuretics. Furosemide is typically used in the management of hypervolemia, while hydrochlorothiazide is a first-line treatment for hypertension management. No further measures are indicated at this time (Choice E) is not the correct answer choice, as the patient's blood pressure remains increased and she would benefit from an increased lisinopril dose to improve her blood pressure and reduce her risk for end-stage kidney disease. r-- r \" , r ,",

Malabsorption of substances in the proximal small bowel ensues, which presents symptomatically as chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, and nutritional deficiencies. Abnormal small bowel absorption results in abnormal serum D-xylose and fecal fat tests.

The patient presents with lower neck pain radiating to her back, hypertensive emergency, and a widened mediastinum on a chest x-ray. These are all findings associated with acute aortic dissection. A CT angiography of the thoracic aorta is indicated to further delineate whether the patient exhibits a type A or B aortic dissection, as this will dictate appropriate management. Regardless of which type of aortic dissection the patient has, it is imperative to appropriately treat the patient's hypertensive emergency. Hypertensive emergency is defined as a blood pressure greater than 180/120 with evidence of end-organ damage (eg, aortic dissection). Intravenous antihypertensive medications should be used for the treatment of hypertensive emergency to appropriately reduce blood pressure and limit progression of end-organ damage. In aortic dissection, to prevent the advancement of the dissection flap and resultant occlusion of branch vessels, the blood pressure should be rapidly reduced using a beta-blocker to lower cardiac output and diminish fluctuations in pulse pressure, combined with an alpha blocker or arterial vasodilator to lower mean 13 arterial pressure by reducing vascular resistance.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Prerenal azotemia refers to an acute kidney injury secondary to decreased renal blood flow, which results in a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), typically in the setting of hypovolemia, hypotension, or renal hypoperfusion. In response to the decreased renal blood flow, renin and angiotensin are upregulated, which stimulates increased absorption of sodium in the proximal convoluted tubule. This leads to decreased fractional excretion of sodium (less than 1% ). The decreased GFR results in decreased tubular flow rate, which consequently leads to increased urea nitrogen reabsorption, although creatinine is unable to be reabsorbed by the renal tubules. This results in an increased serum urea nitrogen (BUN) to serum creatinine (Cr) ratio, typically greater than 20. Treatment of prerenal azotemia requires treatment of the underlying cause of reduced renal blood flow. If untreated, this can progress to worsening acute kidney injury and possible intrinsic renal failure (end-stage kidney disease). lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. Acute glomerulonephritis (Choice A), acute tubular necrosis (Choice B), diabetic nephropathy (Choice C) and interstitial nephritis (Choice D) are all causes of intrinsic renal failure (end-stage kidney disease), which would present with an increased fractional excretion of sodium and a BUN/Cr ratio less than 20, due to underlying tubular dysfunction. Acute glomerulonephritis (Choice A) refers to a variety of glomerular diseases, including nephritic and nephrotic syndromes. Nephritic syndromes typically present with acute end-stage kidney disease with associated hematuria, red blood cell casts, and hypertension. Nephrotic syndrome typically presents with excessive proteinuria (greater than 3 g/day), hyperlipidemia, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Acute tubular necrosis (Choice B) typically occurs following an ischemic or nephrotoxic insult to the kidneys, which results in necrosis of the tubular epithelium. Granular, muddy brown casts are typical on urinalysis. Diabetic nephropathy (Choice C) occurs following nonenzymatic glycosylation of the glomerular basement membrane and efferent arterioles, characteristically presenting as Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions on light microscopy. This progresses over time in patients with diabetes mellitus, initially beginning as microalbuminuria, which can subsequently progress to macroalbuminuria, and then end-stage kidney disease. Interstitial nephritis (Choice D) commonly presents as a hypersensitivity reaction following exposure to certain medications such as penicillin, diuretics, and sulfonamides. It can also occur in the setting of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. It typically presents with pyuria, predominantly eosinophilic. e e e • , • I ., I I I I I • I I I • I .. .. I • 11 .. I II I I I I I I • I .. • I Ii I I II I • I .. I I • • I • I ., .. I • 11 ..

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Obstruction of the small bowel occurs from partial or complete blockage of the small bowel lumen and typically presents with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Partial small bowel obstructions will allow a degree of continued flatus with diminished stooling, and complete obstructions will result in obstipation. Small bowel obstruction (SBO) has many potential causes, although the most common are post-surgical peritoneal adhesions and hernias. On physical exam, SBO typically presents with abdominal tenderness, distention, tympany to percussion, and borborygmi (high-pitched, hyperactive bowel sounds). Potential complications of SBO include bowel rupture and/or necrosis, which can result in sudden-onset peritonitic abdominal signs such as rebound tenderness and guarding. Abdominal x-rays typically demonstrate multiple air-fluid levels in the setting of dilated small bowel loops. Management requires bowel rest and intravenous hydration and sometimes surgical intervention. If the patient has a partial obstruction, the patient should be monitored and provided supportive care. If the patient demonstrates features concerning for a complete obstruction, an exploratory laparotomy should be performed to alleviate the cause of the obstruction. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Cecal volvulus (Choice A) results from twisting of the cecal mesentery and can be a cause of large bowel obstruction. It is less common than sigmoid volvulus and can be associated with a hyper-mobile cecum. lieus (Choice B) refers to intestinal hypomotility without a mechanical obstruction, most commonly occurring following surgery or in the setting of electrolyte abnormalities, and typically presents with diffuse small and large bowel dilatation. Pseudo-obstruction of the colon (Choice D), also known as Ogilvie syndrome, results in dilatation of the large bowel without a mechanical obstruction.

It was commonly caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b prior to widespread pediatric vaccination. Epiglottitis presents with fever and acute severe pharyngitis, drooling, hoarseness, and dysphagia. On lateral neck x-rays, it appears as a \"thumbprint sign.\" Patients typically present in a toxic state and can exhibit rapid respiratory decompensation with the development of strider and airway obstruction. Because of this, first-line therapy is to emergently establish a protected airway through endotracheal intubation. In the setting of epiglottitis, endotracheal intubation should take place in the operating room under direct visualization with a laryngoscope if the patient is stable enough to permit transfer out of the emergency department.",

It can lead to Legionnaires disease, most commonly occurring in patients who\nare chronic smokers or have underlying chronic lung disease. Legionnaires disease is characterized by fever, atypical pneumonia, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. The atypical pneumonia\nmay appear as diffuse, patchy alveolar and interstitial opacities on lung imaging. It can also be associated with hyponatremia.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Choledocholithiasis refers to the presence of a gallstone located within the common bile duct. This can result in varying degrees of obstruction, which dictates the severity of presenting symptoms. Obstructive choledocholithiasis results in colicky right upper quadrant or epigastric pain (biliary colic), nausea, vomiting, and increased direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Direct hyperbilirubinemia can lead to scleral icterus and jaundice. Depending on the location of the common bile duct stone, choledocholithiasis can result in acute pancreatitis, which manifests with epigastric pain and increased pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase). If acute bacterial infection of the biliary tree ensues, this can lead to fever and acute cholangitis. The primary treatment for choledocholithiasis is an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy, followed by cholecystectomy. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Alcoholism (Choice A) is a common cause of acute pancreatitis, which can result in epigastric pain and increased amylase, although would be unlikely to result in direct hyperbilirubinemia. Cholecystitis (Choice B) results from obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone with resultant bacterial infection of the gallbladder, and presents with right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. It would not typically present with increased liver function tests or pancreatic enzymes. Hepatoma (Choice D), also known as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), can present with right upper quadrant tenderness and hepatomegaly with associated hepatic enzyme (AST/ALT) and a-fetoprotein elevation. The main risk factors for HCC are cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B infection. Pancreatic carcinoma (Choice E) often presents with nonspecific symptoms such as chronic abdominal pain radiating to the back, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weight loss. If the pancreatic carcinoma is located in the pancreatic head/neck region, it can result in painless obstructive jaundice. Pancreatic carcinoma would not typically present with acute abdominal pain or increased pancreatic enzymes. r-- r \" , r ,",

These recurrent pulmonary infections can lead to the development of bronchiectasis over time . For further differentiation of the patient's primary immunodeficiency, quantitative immunoglobulin testing should be performed to delineate the patient's immunologic pathophysiology. B-cell disorders include such diseases as X-linked agammaglobulinemia, selective lgA deficiency, and common variable immunodeficiency .

Evaluation for osteoporosis occurs through performance of a DEXA scan and is defined as a bone mineral density less than 2.5 standard deviations compared to a young, normal population (T-score). The most common risk factors for the development of osteoporosis are age, smoking, chronic inflammatory disease , corticosteroid use, and estrogen-depleting conditions in women. Osteoporosis is often asymptomatic but increases the risk for fractures, most commonly involving the hip, vertebrae, and distal radius. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation are the first line for treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. Reduction of active osteoporotic risk factors should also be pursued . Weight-bearing exercises are recommended to slow deterioration of bone mineral density. Bisphosphonates (eg, alendronate) inhibit osteoclast activity.

The aneurysm rupture may have been precipitated by an event increasing her mean arterial pressure, which would increase stress on the aneurysmal vascular wall. Lumbar puncture demonstrates a significant number of red blood cells, which are typical in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage. A CT scan of the head without contrast is typically obtained in the acute setting to confirm the presence of subarachnoid blood, and if confirmed, further angiographic imaging of the head is necessary to identify the presence of an aneurysm.",

As a thrombus occludes the cross-sectional area of a deep vein, the valves, which originate from the walls of the veins, become involved in the thrombus either through compression against the wall of the vessel or through incorporation into the thrombus during propagation. When the thrombus resolves, the residual valve may be dysfunctional from damage to the leaflets, annulus, or diameter of the native vessel. This prevents the valve from functioning effectively and results in retrograde venous flow secondary to gravity. Inadequate venous drainage of the lower extremities can result in varicose veins, chronic edema, and stasis dermatitis.",

When the infection is severe and has infiltrated outside the external ear canal causing extensive tissue destruction, it is termed necrotizing (or malignant) otitis externa, which requires treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Otitis externa is not always necrotizing. The non-necrotizing variant is commonly known as \"swimmer's ear,\" and presents with mild external ear pain, watery discharge, swelling, and erythema of the external acoustic meatus.

Polyuria and associated volume depletion are secondary to the direct effects of hypercalcemia on the kidney, which results in renal resistance and lack of response to anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), known as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

This results in symptoms such as oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, weight gain, skin changes, osteoporosis, and hyperglycemia.

There are multiple potential etiologies of Cushing syndrome, including pituitary adenoma, adrenal tumor, or ectopic paraneoplastic ACTH secretion (eg, small-cell lung cancer). Along with the increased production of cortisol, Cushing syndrome from an adrenal etiology can also result in increased concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) produced within the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex.

This granulomatous expression of the enzyme results in an increased production of active vitamin D3, which leads to increased intestinal absorption of calcium, resulting in hypercalcemia. This vitamin D3- dependent hypercalcemia results in physiologic suppression of parathyroid hormone.

The inferior wall of the heart and the atrioventricular (AV) node often share a common blood supply from the right coronary artery (RCA). When the RCA is blocked, infarction of both the inferior wall and the AV node can occur, which can lead to an AV block with a junctional escape rhythm. In normal sinus rhythm, there is a one-to-one relationship between the P wave and QRS complex, which is not seen in the setting of complete heart block. In fact, there is no relationship between the P and QRS frequencies, with each maintaining its own unique, separate rate per minute.

A lesion located within the anterior and lateral fascicles of the spinal cord white matter would result in injury to the ALS tract and lateral CST. This would result in contralateral loss of fine touch and temperature perception since the primary sensory neuron for the ALS tract decussates within the spinal cord along the ventral white commissure, followed by ascent within the anterolateral tract of the spinal cord.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma most commonly occurs in the pancreatic head. It is often initially characterized by nonspecific vague abdominal discomfort or weight loss. As the pancreatic mass increases in size, it can lead to the obstruction and dilation of both the common bile duct and main pancreatic duct, referred to as a double-duct sign on ultrasound. This can result in painless jaundice and/or pancreatitis from obstruction of these ducts. If the pancreatic adenocarcinoma continues to spread and results in infiltration of surround ing abdominal viscera and/or encasement of adjacent neurovascular structures, this can manifest with severe abdominal pain. The nonspecific nature of pancreatic adenocarcinoma's early symptoms creates a diagnostic dilemma , as many benign conditions present similarly. It is frequently asymptomatic until it creates an obstruction, gastrointestinal dysfunction, perineural or vascular encasement/invasion, or metastatic disease .",

It is characteristically distributed along the location of clothing, perfume, plant contact, or nickel jewelry contact. The rashes are often described as linear or angular in shape. In some cases, the rash can spread from the point of initial contact through transfer of the allergen by hand contact. Frequent allergens resulting in contact dermatitis are nickel, topical antibiotics, and poison ivy or oak . Diagnosis for the specific causative allergen can be made through patch testing, with first-line treatments being topical corticosteroids and avoidance of the culprit allergen.",

Polymyositis is an autoimmune condition affecting the proximal muscles. It is closely related to dermatomyositis, however, unlike dermatomyositis, it does not present with cutaneous findings. The muscular inflammation is characterized by endomysial COB+ inflammatory infiltrate. This is in contrast to dermatomyositis which demonstrates a perimysial CD4+ inflammato ry infiltrate. An inflammatory infiltrate of the muscle occurs, causing damage to the myocytes, leading to release of creatine kinase, an intracellular molecule. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is also increased, indicating the presence of inflammation. This can be used to monitor disease progress in polymyositis. Both polymyositis and dermatomyositis are characterized by several autoantibodies: positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti-Jo-1, anti-SRP, and anti-Mi-2. Treatment of polymyositis involves systemic steroids followed by long-term immunosuppressive therapy with medications such as methotrexate or azathioprine.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Multiple sclerosis, the most prevalent immune-mediated demyelinating disease, may present initially with transverse myelitis though can also demonstrate neurologic symptoms from lesions in other central nervous system (CNS) locations. Transverse myelitis refers to inflammation that extends transversely across the spinal cord, leading to bilateral sensory, motor, or autonomic dysfunction. When sensory tracts are involved, sensory deficits are evident at a clear dermatomal level (also known as a sensory level, likely T10 in this patient) and may present as a band-like sensation at that level. Autonomic symptoms may present as urinary urgency or incontinence, bowel incontinence, or sexual dysfunction. According to the McDonald criteria for multiple sclerosis diagnosis, patients must have evidence of demyelinating lesions that are separated in time and location. This evidence can be based on subjective symptoms or imaging evidence. This patient presents with evidence of lesions separated in space (a T10 spinal cord lesion, a lesion potentially affecting the medial longitudinal fasciculus, several corticospinal tract lesions as evidenced by diffuse hyperreflexia). Though the patient did not experience discrete symptomatic episodes separated by time, the presence of multiple lesions in discrete locations makes multiple sclerosis the most likely diagnosis (as the other deficits likely arose at different times). MRI of the brain typically shows white matter hyperintensities in the periventricular region, cortex, subcortical region, cerebellum, or spine. Oligoclonal bands of immunoglobu lins, indicating immune overactivation, can be found in the cerebrospinal fluid but are not necessary for diagnosis. Treatment includes corticosteroids for symptomatic management of acute flares and long-term disease-modifying treatments such as interferon or monoclonal antibodies.",

The ventral nerve roots, containing motor and sympathetic efferents, are most commonly involved, though the dorsal nerve root (controlling sensation) may also be affected. As such, patients typically present with acute symmetric muscle weakness with depressed or absent deep tendon reflexes (reflecting a lower motor neuron pattern of dysfunction) that begins in the lower extremities and may rapidly ascend to involve the upper extremities, bulbar muscles, or respiratory muscles. Autonomic dysfunction (eg, blood pressure fluctuations, cardiac irregularities) is common. Sensory deficits and pain can also occur (though these symptoms are typically mild compared to motor dysfunction). The diagnosis is confirmed by increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell counts on lumbar puncture, termed albuminocytologic dissociation, thought to reflect generalized inflammation.

Oxalate crystals are seen on urine microscopy. These metabolites also contribute to an anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "A thorough neurologic examination should include evaluation of the cranial nerves, gait, coordination, movement, muscle strength and tone, light touch, pain and temperature sensation, deep tendon reflexes, and the plantar response (Babinski sign). Deep tendon reflexes can be checked over the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, knee, and Achilles tendons using a reflex hammer. They are graded on a scale of Oto 4 where 0 is absent, 2 is normal, and 4 is clonus (continual contraction). Reflex strength should be compared on either side and within the same patient. The Achilles reflex test is particularly useful for evaluating pathology of the S1 nerve root and differentiating upper from lower motor neuron dysfunction. However, bilaterally absent Achilles reflex is also a normal variation, the proportion of which increases with age. Thus, in this case, the absence of both Achilles reflexes does not require any additional management. Educational Objectives: A, B, C, and D. Measurement of urine lead concentration (Choice A) is appropriate when lead poisoning is suspected. Symptoms of lead poisoning occur within days or weeks of exposure and include distal motor neuropathy. While this does cause hyporeflexia, it would affect all the reflexes in the body, not just the Achilles. It would also cause other lower motor neuron symptoms such as muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations, which this patient lacks. MRI of the lumbar spine (Choice B) would be beneficial in evaluating hyporeflexia because of a spinal nerve or spinal cord lesion. Neither of these pathologies would present with bilaterally absent Achilles reflexes alone without other symptoms like back pain or muscle weakness. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies (Choice C) are used to support a diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis. This condition is associated with muscle weakness, not peripheral neuropathy. These studies are not necessary in this asymptomatic individual.",

Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that increases synaptic serotonin activity and improves mood in patients with major depressive disorder. SSRls commonly cause sexual dysfunction within all three phases of sexual response (libido, sexual arousal, and orgasm). If the sexual dysfunction is persistent and distressing, management commonly involves lowering the SSRI dose, switching to an antidepressant with a lower risk for sexual dysfunction (eg, bupropion, mirtazapine), or adding bupropion or a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor such as sildenafil. Libido is typically enhanced by dopamine and gonadal hormones and may be inhibited by medications such as antipsychotics and SSRls. Arousal is promoted by acetylcholine, which leads to vasodilation of the helicine/vaginal arteries and consequent penile/clitora l tumescence. Medications with anticholinergic activity and SSRls inhibit arousal. Norepinephrine enhances orgasm (and ejaculation), and beta blockers and SSRls inhibit orgasm.",

The C6 nerve root carries efferent information for the biceps reflex. Dermatomes and myotomes are components of the embryonic somite, a paired segment of paraxial mesoderm. When fully developed, the dermatome is an area of skin whose afferent fibers travel within a single spinal nerve, and myotome is a group of muscles innervated by efferent fibers from a single spinal nerve. Radiculopathy refers to pathology of a spinal nerve root and may be caused by spondylosis (degenerative changes of the spine), disc herniation, infection, tumor, demyelination, or infarction. Disc herniation and spondylosis are the most common causes and lead to compression of the nerve root as it exits the spinal cord.

This pattern of pain is known as inflammatory back pain. Sacroiliac arthritis and enthesitis (inflammation of the attachments of tendons and ligaments to bone) are other common joint manifestations. Extra-articular manifestations commonly include anterior uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. AS is associated with reactive arthritis, which classical ly presents with post-infectious conjunctivitis, arthritis, and urethritis. Over time, patients with AS can develop decreased spine mobility, hyperkyphosis, osteopenia, and an increased risk for vertebra l fragility fractures. Laboratory studies demonstrate increased acute phase reactant concentrations (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) along with a positive HLA-B27 test in many patients. Plain x-rays may illustrate fused vertebrae and sacroiliac joints.

This patient has multiple risk factors for ischemic stroke including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, atherosclerotic disease, and atrial fibrillation. An embolic ischemic stroke involves an event in which a clot breaks off and travels to the brain, occluding blood flow at a cerebral artery. Emboli can come from proximal vessels, such as the internal carotid artery, or from an atrial thrombus. This patient has an atrial thrombus, which can embolize and cause an ischemic stroke. After a transient ischemic attack, measures for prevention of an ischemic stroke should be enacted. In this patient with atrial fibrillation and a known atrial thrombus, an anticoagulant would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to help prevent ischemic stroke.

Acoustic neuromas are benign tumors consisting of Schwann cells that arise from the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII). Lesions of the vestibulocochlear nerve typically disrupt ipsilateral hearing and the sensation of head and body position, which leads to difficulty with balance and tandem (heel-to-toe) gait as in this patient. Mass effect from progressive ly enlarging acoustic neuromas can compress the neighboring facial nerve or the upper motor neurons synapsing on the facial nerve, leading to a flattened nasolabial fold and perioral droop. If the upper motor neurons are affected, the forehead is spared, as the facial nerve nucleus that controls forehead musculature is dually innervated by upper motor neurons from bilateral precentral gyri. Because of this, the patient would be expected to symmetrically raise her eyebrows. Alternatively, lesions involving the lower motor neurons of facial expression (eg, facial nerve inflammation in Bell palsy) affect the forehead and lower face together. Depending on patient age, tumor size, and symptom burden, acoustic neuromas can be managed with observation, radiation, or surgery.",

More common ly, pituitary mass lesions do not cause hyperpituitarism but instead cause compression of normal pituitary neurons, leading to hypopituitarism and dysfunction of multiple endocrine axes. The pituitary gland rests in the bony sella turcica, just inferior to the optic chiasm. Retinal ganglion cell fibers from the nasal retina, which supply the temporal visual fields, decussate at the chiasm, and are vulnerable to compression by pituitary mass lesions.

Narcolepsy arises from deficient production of orexins in the hypothalamus, which may result from genetic or autoimmune causes. Orexins typically induce the secretion of monoamines such as norepinephrine throughout the brain to promote wakefulness. As a result, patients suddenly and inappropriate ly transition into sleep during the day. Further, rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep features (eg, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis) occur during wakefulness. Cataplexy refers to a sudden loss of muscle tone and usually occurs in response to positive emotion. The clinical diagnosis should be confirmed by a polysomnography (to confirm the rapid transition into REM sleep and rule out other causes of daytime sleepiness) and a multiple sleep latency test (to confirm decreased sleep latency). Treatment includes a regular sleep schedule, avoidance of daytime naps, and, in patients with severe daytime sleepiness, modafinil.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common cause of vertigo that occurs as a result of a calcium carbonate particle (otoconium) that gets displaced from the otolith organs into the adjacent semicircu lar canals. The otolith organs and semicircular canals are located in the inner ear and sense movement of the head. Normally, otoconia are contained within the matrix of the otolith organs, adding weight to the organs so that the organs shift in position when head position changes. When otoconia become dislodged, they cause abnormal movement of the endolymph within the semicircular canals and the subsequent sensation of head movement. Consequently, patients present with minutes-long, abrupt episodes of vertigo that may be accompanied by nausea, which resolve when holding still. The cochlear apparatus is intact, resulting in normal hearing. Symptom resolution with particle repositioning maneuvers such as the Epley maneuver serves to both diagnose and treat BPPV. Vertigo is the sensation that the surroundings are moving and is associated with lesions of the peripheral or central vestibular system. Peripheral vertigo is typically short-lived and sudden in onset, whereas central vertigo is insidious in onset and may cause constant and sustained vertigo. Peripheral causes of vertigo such as BPPV may also present with uni- or multidirectional nystagmus and may decrease as patients focus their gaze, while central causes of vertigo such as brainstem tumors or strokes typically lead to purely unidirectional nystagmus that does not improve with primary gaze.",

Though arthritis is typically an early manifestation of acute rheumatic fever, Sydenham chorea is a latent manifestation and may occur months after the initial streptococcal infection. In acute rheumatic fever, streptococca l infection causes immune cross-reactivity with neuronal and cardiac cell membrane proteins and the deposition of immune complexes in the joints and soft tissues. The binding of antibodies to basal ganglia neurons results in choreiform movements (involuntary, random, irregular movements) of the face, trunk, and extremities that may be more prominent on one side of the body. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as emotional !ability and obsessive-compulsive disorder (a disorder associated with basal ganglia pathology) may also occur. Sydenham chorea may occur as an isolated manifestation of acute rheumatic fever or in conjunction with arthritis, carditis, erythema marginatum, and/or subcutaneous nodules. As such, patients with Sydenham chorea should receive an echocardiography to evaluate for carditis. The treatment of acute rheumatic fever involves nonsteroida l anti-inflammatory drugs and penicillin to ensure the eradication of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A).

Myasthenia gravis is a B lymphocyte-driven autoimmune disorder characterized by the formation of inhibitory anti-acetylcholine receptor autoantibodies. Patients typically experience muscular weakness and fatigue that worsens toward the end of the day, as well as ocular symptoms of drooping eyelids and diplopia. Many patients present with ocular findings and later develop generalized symptoms involving the proximal muscles. In severe exacerbations (myasthenic crises), patients may develop weakness of the muscles of the throat, diaphragm, and chest wall, leading to dysphagia and acute respiratory failure. Myasthenia gravis is diagnosed with the detection of serum autoantibodies. A chest x-ray is useful for detecting the presence of thymoma, which frequently produces myasthenia gravis as a paraneoplastic phenomenon. Some patients experience resolution of symptoms after surgical resection of a thymoma, although most patients require treatment with corticosteroids and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (eg, pyridostigmine).

Ocular examination demonstrates reduced visual acuity and color vision, a relative afferent pupillary defect, and may demonstrate optic disc edema. Diagnosis is confirmed with MRI demonstrating hyperintensity of the optic nerve. Patients with optic neuritis are at increased risk for multiple sclerosis (MS), and optic neuritis is a common initial finding in patients with MS. Recently, autoantibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) have been identified as causative of some cases of optic neuritis. Patients who develop optic neuritis as a result of antibodies against MOG and AQP4 often have severe presentations but also have decreased risk for subsequent MS compared to patients with optic neuritis who lack these autoantibodies. The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial demonstrated that a short course of treatment with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone speeds the rate of visual recovery and delays the onset of MS, although it does not impact final visual acuity, and demonstrated that the presence and quantity of periventricular white matter lesions on MRI is the most important prognostic risk factor for the subsequent development of MS.",

With prolonged exposure, chronic neurologic symptoms such as decline in cognition, depression, distal motor neuropathy, decreased hearing, tremor, and decreased brain volume on imaging may be present. The distal motor neuropathy causes lower motor neuron signs such as atrophy of muscles and hyporeflexia, as shown in this patient. Microcytic anemia is also common, since lead inhibits the enzymes ferrochelatase and o-ALA dehydratase, resulting in decreased heme synthesis. In adults, exposure to lead primarily comes through occupation and/or hobbies. Individuals working with batteries, mining, construction , or ammunition are at higher risk. Illegally distilling alcohol has a risk for lead toxicity because of the leaching of lead from solder in the still, which is likely where this patient received exposure. Diagnosis is suspected based on exposure and symptoms and confirmed with increased serum lead concentration. Management of lead poisoning depends on the blood lead concentration and presence of symptoms, and includes chelation with dimercaprol, ethylene diamine tetraacetate, or succimer. Sources of lead should be investigated and eliminated.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Electrophysiological studies are utilized to diagnose ulnar neuropathy. Ulnar neuropathy typically arises from ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow or wrist, which may occur idiopathically or because of trauma, compression, or elbow joint pathology. While ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow typically results in numbness and paresthesia of the medial hand and wrist, ulnar nerve entrapment at the wrist typically leads to weakness of the intrinsic hand muscles and the consequent loss of hand dexterity. The ulnar nerve innervates the palmaris brevis, hypothenar, lumbrical, interossei, and adductor pollicis muscles. As a result of adductor pollicis dysfunction, patients illustrate a decreased ability to pinch the first two digits together. As a result of interossei muscle dysfunction, this patient is unable to fully abduct or adduct the digits. Sensory dysfunction in the ulnar distribution may result from ulnar entrapment at the wrist as well. Electrophysiological studies (eg, nerve conduction studies or electromyography) confirm the clinical diagnosis.

Normally, action potentials lead to depolarization in the termina l bouton of the axon. Voltage-gated calcium channels consequently open and allow calcium influx, which triggers the exocytosis of neurotransmitter-fil led vesicles into the synaptic cleft. Patients with myasthenic (Lambert-Eaton) syndrome possess antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels on presynaptic lower motor neurons, which decreases calcium influx and acetylcholine release to postsynaptic skeletal muscle cells. This patient with a smoking history, persistent cough, weight loss, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate likely has small cell lung cancer and paraneoplastic autoantibody production against voltage-gated calcium channels, causing myasthenic (Lambert-Eaton) syndrome. Patients consequent ly demonstrate progressive proxima l muscle weakness with depressed or absent deep tendon reflexes. The muscle weakness typically improves with exercise as small amounts of acetylcholine accumulate in the synaptic cleft over time, increasing the frequency of postsynaptic action potentials in skeletal muscle cells.

Most people experience an asymptomatic infection with human polyomavirus 2 during childhood, at which point the virus becomes latent. In severely immunocompromised patients, human polyomavirus 2 can reactivate and infect oligodendrocytes, leading to demyelination. Patients typically present with the subacute onset of focal neurologic deficits related to the affected brain area and cognitive impairment. Patients who are immunocompromised enough to have PML may also present with symptoms of other opportunistic infections. This patient's thrush and potential Mycobacterium avium complex infection (which likely explains his fever, diarrhea, and weight loss) indicate severe immune compromise in the setting of decreased adherence to antiretroviral therapy. MRI may demonstrate unilateral or bilateral white matter lesions without mass effect indicative of demyelination, which may progress to cortical atrophy.

Visual symptoms are a prominent feature of a PCA territory infarction and include cortical blindness, contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing, visual agnosia, and prosopagnosia. Occlusion of the right PCA typically leads to left homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing (caused by damage of the right primary visual cortex) and may lead to left hemineglect (caused by damage of the right parietal cortex). Left homonymous hemianopia likely explains this patient's car accident and may lead to mild balance difficulties. Occlusion of the right PCA may also result in left hemisensory deficit (caused by thalamus damage) and left hemiparesis (caused by damage to the cerebral peduncles in the midbrain). Cerebral infarctions, also known as strokes, occur as a result of ischemic or hemorrhagic loss of blood supply to the brain. Approximately 80% to 85% of strokes are ischemic, commonly arising from thromboembolic disease (eg, middle cerebral artery occlusion from a thrombus), whereas 15% to 20% of strokes are hemorrhagic because of blood vessel rupture (eg, hypertension-related intraparenchymal hemorrhage from a perforating artery).

It is characterized by the inability of myocytes to break down glycogen as a result of the absence of muscular glycogen phosphorylase, which causes exercise intolerance with fatigue, cramping, and muscle weakness. Muscle cramping may resolve with rest or be permanent. Occasionally, a \"second wind\" phenomenon may be seen when blood flow to the muscles increases after approximate ly 10 minutes of exercise, delivering fatty acids as fuel and relieving the need for glycogen breakdown. Patients may also have episodes of rhabdomyolysis, accompanied by red or brown urine and urinalysis positive for blood resulting from the presence of myoglobinuria without microscopic evidence of red blood cells. A complication of McArdle disease is acute kidney injury and acute tubular necrosis secondary to the release of nephrotoxic myoglobin and heme pigments in rhabdomyolysis.

Over time, thiamine deficiency can result in damage and atrophy of the mammillary bodies, visible on MRI of the brain, which manifests as Wernicke encephalopathy. To prevent Wernicke encephalopathy, all patients with sustained heavy alcohol use should be given oral thiamine supplementation, and patients presenting with acute intoxication should generally be given parenteral thiamine. The typical clinical presentation of Wernicke encephalopathy is a triad of acutely altered mental status, ophthalmoplegia (along with nystagmus), and ataxia. The symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy are reversible but increase the risk for developing Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in patients with alcohol use disorder if not immediately treated with high-dose parenteral thiamine.

PMR is an inflammatory disorder that often occurs concurrently with giant cell arteritis (GCA), a large vessel vasculitis. Symptoms include proximal muscle and joint (eg, shoulder and hip girdle) pain and stiffness. If untreated, muscle weakness may occur from disuse atrophy. Systemic symptoms such as fatigue are commonly seen. The diagnosis is clinical, and treatment is with low-dose prednisone for up to a year. It is common for patients to respond to prednisone almost immediately, thus the absence of response should prompt consideration of a different diagnosis. As GCA occurs concurrently in up to 20% of patients who have PMR, symptoms of throbbing temporal headache, vision changes, or jaw claudication should prompt temporal artery biopsy and initiation of high-dose prednisone.",

Classic findings include systemic symptoms of fever, chills, and weight loss, headache, history of preceding transient vision loss (amaurosis fugax), jaw claudication, tenderness of the scalp, and pale optic disc edema. New headaches in an elderly patient should raise suspicion for GCA. GCA frequently occurs in association with polymyalgia rheumatica, which is characterized by stiffness and pain of proximal muscles. Results of laboratory studies show increased inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, and thrombocytosis. GCA is characterized by a predilection to involve the vessels of the head and neck, and often affects the ophthalmic artery, inflammatory occlusion of which can result in sudden, ischemic damage to the retina. Once vision loss occurs, it is typically irreversible, and is commonly followed by vision loss in the contralateral eye within days or weeks. The diagnosis is confirmed with biopsy of the temporal artery demonstrating granulomatous vasculitis.

These findings are characteristic of the several stages of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy is treated with rigorous glycemic control.

The disease is endemic to developing countries. Patients typically present with pigmented, hypoesthetic skin lesions with associated paresthesia along with thickened nerves and sensorimotor neuropathy, likely as a result of an immune response leading to segmental demyelination. The most commonly affected nerves are the ulnar, median, common peroneal, facial, and greater auricular nerves. Presentations range from one or a few well-demarcated skin lesions with associated focal neuropathy (known as tuberculoid disease) to diffuse skin lesions and neuropathy (known as lepromatous disease). If left untreated, neuropathy can progress and cause permanent disability, and skin lesions can become nodular and repeatedly ulcerate, which may lead to coarsened facial features. Diagnosis is made by skin biopsy showing acid-fast bacilli within a cutaneous nerve. Treatment requires dapsone and rifampin, along with clofazimine in lepromatous disease.

The disease usually presents with an insidious onset of psychiatric (eg, irritability, depression, psychosis) and cognitive symptoms. Motor symptoms (eg, chorea, hypotonia, dystonia, loss of voluntary control of movements) typically appear later in the disease course. People with HD typically die 10 to 40 years after disease onset. Chorea, a key HD symptom, can be initially experienced as restlessness. Treatment is symptomatic and can include tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine, which target chorea by depleting dopamine stores. HD is caused by expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (CAG) on chromosome four, which occurs when a series of three nucleotides in repetition are replicated incorrectly and too many repeats are included in the replicated product.

Upon leaving the brainstem, the oculomotor nerve courses beneath the posterior cerebral and posterior communicating arteries, and it is vulnerable to aneurysmal compression at this location. The fibers responsible for control of the pupil are found on the superficial aspect of the oculomotor nerve and are thus first affected by external compression. This distinguishes acquired oculomotor nerve palsy caused by aneurysmal compression from palsy caused by microvascular ischemia, which typically spares the pupil. The detection of a new oculomotor nerve palsy is a medical emergency and should prompt an immediate search for a potential aneurysm, as aneurysmal rupture can lead to life-threatening subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Delirium tremens, the most concerning and life threatening complication of alcohol withdrawa l, involves severe confusion and disorientation, fluctuations in consciousness, agitation, visual hallucinations, and autonomic instability (variable pulse and blood pressure with hyperthermia). As in this patient, delirium tremens typically begins 2 to 5 days after the patient's last alcoholic drink. Patients with delirium tremens may die from associated dysrhythmias or respiratory failure. Delirium tremens is managed supportively with benzodiazepines to address agitation and prevent the symptoms of withdrawal, intravenous fluids, nutritiona l supplementation, and frequent assessment including vital sign checks.

One such nerve is the peroneal nerve, which provides sensory innervation through its superficial branch to the dorsal foot and lateral shin and motor innervation through its deep branch to the tibialis anterior muscle, the primary dorsiflexor of the ankle joint. The peroneal nerve is relatively superficial as it wraps around the lateral aspect of the proximal fibula, before dividing into deep and superficial branches. Because of its location, compression of the peroneal nerve potentially occurs when certain positions are kept for a prolonged period, such as sitting with crossed legs or lying in a lateral decubitus position on a hard surface. Prolonged compression of the peroneal nerve will potentially cause damage and dysfunction of the nerve, which may manifest as diminished strength in ankle dorsiflexion, as seen in this patient. Sensory loss and paresthesias over the dorsal foot and lateral shin are also usually present. Treatment is to relieve the source of compression of the nerve, typically by using cushioning while sleeping or avoiding sitting with crossed legs during the day. During the recovery period, patients should also be given an ankle-foot orthosis to keep the foot dorsiflexed until motor strength has recovered.",

In some cases, the SDH may be large enough to compress adjacent brain parenchyma; the displacement of the cerebral hemisphere can result in neurologic deficits, altered mental status, seizures, herniation syndromes, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Patients may manifest upper motoneuron examination findings such as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar reflex (Babinski sign). Elderly patients are at risk for cerebral atrophy, which places traction on bridging cortical veins. In this setting, minor trauma such as falls can result in shearing of the veins leading to hemorrhage. Untreated, the SDH may continue to grow in size. The intracranial compartment is a fixed space within a rigid skull; pathologic lesions such as SDH can result in midline shift and herniation of central nervous system structures if large enough.

When complete ipsilateral facial nerve palsy occurs in isolation, it is known as Bell palsy, which is thought to most commonly be related to the reactivation of herpes simplex virus, though it is often idiopathic. It is typically a benign condition that gradually improves over time, although treatment with oral steroids and occasionally with acyclovir is indicated to expedite recovery. The facial nerve, also known as cranial nerve VII, provides motor innervation to the muscles of the face, parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal, submandibu lar, and sublingual salivary glands, and sensory innervation to the distal part of the tongue and the external auditory canal.

VZV, also known as human herpesvirus-3 (HHV-3), is transmitted via direct contact with infected skin lesions or respiratory secretions. VZV causes two diseases: varicella and herpes zoster. Varicella, or chickenpox, occurs in immunocompetent children and is characterized by a pruritic, asynchronous rash with fluid-filled vesicles that crust over and may be transmitted through respiratory secretions or contact with active skin lesions. Herpes zoster, or shingles, is caused by the recurrence of VZV after it has been reactivated from its dormancy in the dorsal root ganglion of a spinal nerve. It most commonly presents as a unilateral, dermatomal erythematous patch with overlying clear to yellow, grouped vesicles. It can be associated with neuropathic pain, which can both precede and outlast the rash. The thoracic spinal nerves and trigeminal nerve, as in this patient, are particularly common distributions of reactivation. Treatment for herpetic infections including herpes zoster infections involves drugs that inhibit viral DNA polymerase, classically by guanosine analogs such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir.

By an unknown mechanism, bupropion decreases the seizure threshold. Bupropion is a cytochrome P450 (CYP)-2D6 substrate, while terbinafine (an oral antifungal medication utilized for onychomycosis) is a CYP-2D6 inhibitor. Consequent ly, this patient's bupropion serum concentrations were likely increased by the initiation of terbinafine. Most medication-induced seizures are generalized tonic-clonic seizures, but some are absence seizures. Absence seizures are generalized seizures that cause transient staring episodes with impaired consciousness during the seizure.

However, sensitivity of CT for SAH can be reduced with small volume bleeding or delayed presentation. If there is continued strong suspicion for SAH following a normal CT scan of the head, a lumbar puncture can be performed, which can show red blood cells or xanthochromia (hemoglobin degradation products). As the blood products circulate within the subarachnoid space, complications include the development of communicating and/or obstructive hydrocephalus in the acute stage, along with the potential for re-bleeding and vasospasm in the days following the initial bleed.

Emergent MRI of the lumbosacral spine is indicated to investigate the cause of cauda equina syndrome, and to determine the necessity of surgical decompression. Initial treatment for patients with epidural spinal cord compression and neurologic deficits include symptomatic treatment, pain control, and glucocorticoid therapy prior to definitive medical or surgical therapy.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Carotid sinus hypersensitivity syndrome is characterized by an exaggerated response to carotid baroreceptor stimulation, with resultant sinus bradycardia, hypotension, and syncope. Baroreceptors located at the carotid bifurcations and the aortic arch are important in regulating cardiac output and maintaining adequate perfusion pressures to the brain and organs of the upper body. Baroreceptors are sensitive to mechanical pressure; normally, an increase in blood pressure stimulates baroreceptor activity, which activates a reflex arc. This results in parasympathetic innervation of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes and inhibition of sympathetic vascular tone. In turn, this causes decreased pulse and peripheral vascular resistance. Mechanical compression of the baroreceptors from external palpation, such as during shaving of the neck, can potentially stimulate this reflex.",

Myotonic dystrophy has several phenotypes, but all are characterized by muscle weakness and myotonia, defined as delayed relaxation following a normal contraction of the muscle. Classic myotonic dystrophy, as seen in this case, presents during the second, third, or fourth decades of life with muscle weakness, myotonia, cataracts, frontal balding, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypogonadism. The most frequently affected muscles include the facial muscles, sternocleidomastoid, distal forearm muscles, intrinsic hand muscles, and ankle dorsiflexors.

They occur in women more often than men and are associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Patients may be asymptomatic or experience seizures or focal neurologic deficits related to the tumor location. Meningiomas are typically benign but can be malignant. Malignant meningiomas may grow rapidly, leading to symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (eg, postural headache, nausea, papilledema), or may metastasize. Meningiomas appear as well-circumscribed, extra-axia l (ie, outside of the brain parenchyma) masses that compress the parenchyma. They show uniform enhancement on imaging. Definitive diagnosis requires histologic examination of tissue, which will show spindle cells arranged in a whorled pattern with psammoma bodies. Treatment may include antiepileptics or surgical resection to alleviate the tumoral mass effect if significant, though often, periodic surveillance is all that is necessary.",

Emboli can originate from proximal vessels, such as the internal carotid artery, or from an atrial or ventricular thrombus. This patient had a recent myocardial infarction, which predisposes him to a ventricular aneurysm. Ventricular aneurysms are more likely to form in the case of large, anterior myocardial infarctions as a result of obstruction of the left anterior descending coronary artery, as was the case in this patient. A small systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation may be heard. Within the aneurysm, as a result of areas of stagnant blood flow and despite being on clopidogrel, a thrombus can form that can embolize and cause an ischemic stroke. If a patent foramen ovale is present, an embolism may arise from either the right or left side of the heart. This patient also has other risk factors for ischemic stroke including hypertension and atherosclerotic disease.

CRAO is a medical emergency, as it an ischemic stroke of the ophthalmic vasculature and indicates a high risk for associated ischemic stroke to the brain. Patients who present with CRAO should be admitted to a stroke center for emergent evaluation, including a search for a possible embolic source with echocardiography and duplex ultrasonography of the carotid arteries. A careful history and laboratory evaluation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum concentration of C-reactive protein, and platelet count should be performed to evaluate for possible GCA.

Concomitant oral lesions may occur, but their absence does not rule out the diagnosis. The CSF findings include increased protein, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and a normal or low-normal glucose concentration.

Migraine headaches are typically severe, unilateral, throbbing, and associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. The pain is usually located behind or adjacent to the eye. Some patients additiona lly experience an aura before or during the headache, which may present with vision loss followed by the perception of scintillating shapes or lines and/or paresthesia. Migraine triggers include stress, menstruation and changes in hormonal concentrations , weather changes, fasting, and alcohol. Sleep may improve migraines. Patients who experience migraines associated with conjugated estrogen therapy may require discontinuation of therapy or a reduction in dose. Migraines are postulated to arise from deficient serotonin inhibition of descending pain pathways. Acute migraine treatment may include triptans and/or nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Carbidopa and levodopa are given together in order to increase availability of levodopa to the brain. Levodopa is converted to dopamine by the enzyme dopa decarboxylase in the peripheral circulation and the brain. Dopamine is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), so any levodopa which is converted to dopamine peripherally is unable to effect change in the basal ganglia. Carbidopa indirectly increases dopamine availability in the basal ganglia by inhibiting dopa decarboxylase peripherally. In this way, more levodopa is able to cross the BBB and be converted to dopamine in the brain, where it is then able to act on the nigrostriatal pathway. Increased dopamine leads to improvement of Parkinson disease symptoms including the tremor, rigidity, akinesia, and postural instability shown by this patient.",

Methylphenidate works by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into presynaptic neurons. The pathogenesis of narcolepsy involves the loss of orexin-A and orexin-B, which are neurotransmitters found primarily in the hypothalamus that promote wakefulness and inhibit rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Loss of these neurotransmitters permits abnormal transition from wakefulness to REM sleep with subsequent development of hallucinations and other features of narcolepsy including cataplexy and sleep paralysis. Diagnosis can be made in patients with daytime somnolence and cataplexy or, in cases where cataplexy is not present, with sleep latency testing. Polysomnography is appropriate to support the diagnosis and to rule out similar sleep-related conditions such as sleep apnea. Occasionally patients undergo lumbar puncture to directly measure concentrations of orexin-A in the cerebrospinal fluid, but this is generally not required for the diagnosis.

A brainstem lesion of the corticospinal tract leads to contralateral weakness in an upper motoneuron pattern of dysfunction (eg, spastic paralysis, Babinski sign, and hyperreflexia). The corticobulbar tract (located within the cerebral peduncle) may also be affected in Weber syndrome, leading to facial droop and weakness. The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve Ill) is located anteriorly between the two cerebral peduncles and may be affected by strokes of the paramedian branches of the posterior cerebral artery, leading to ipsilateral dysfunction of the extraocu lar muscles and consequent diplopia, ptosis, and primary gaze palsy along with a deficit in pupillary constriction. Cerebral infarctions, or strokes, occur as a result of ischemic or hemorrhagic loss of blood supply to the brain.

Depression is a common complication of Parkinson disease. Since this patient's depression began after his Parkinson disease diagnosis, his depression is likely a result of Parkinson disease and should be diagnosed as depressive disorder caused by another medical condition. Many patients with this diagnosis improve once the medical condition resolves. Since Parkinson disease does not remit, the depression should be treated pharmacologically. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are first-line medications for patients with major depressive disorder and are frequent ly utilized for patients with comorbid Parkinson disease and major depressive disorder because of their effectiveness and low risk for adverse effects. However, serotonergic medications are not effective for smoking cessation. Bupropion is an antidepressant medication that increases the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine (which targets depressive symptoms) and antagonizes the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (which targets tobacco use).

Parkinson disease is a progressive neurologic disease that manifests with bradykinesia, rigidity, masked facies, and a resting tremor. It is secondary to the destruction of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, so pharmacotherapy focuses on replacing dopamine with carbidopa-levodopa. Frequently, early in the disease course, treatment is effective, but over time, many patients experience an \"on-off'' phenomenon whereby pharmacotherapy only works for a short time after each dose before the effects dissipate.

When inhaled, it avidly crosses the pulmonary capillary membrane and tightly binds hemoglobin, inducing a conformationa l change in the molecule and preventing the binding of oxygen. CO has an affinity for hemoglobin that is hundreds of times greater than that of oxygen, readily displacing oxygen from heme. CO also has affinity with the mitochondrial electron transport chain, thus, in addition to hypoxemia resulting from interference with oxygen carrying capacity, cells may not be able to make use of the oxygen that they do receive via aerobic metabolism. As a result, anaerobic metabolism dominates, and lactic acidosis caused by hypoxia ensues. Symptoms of CO poisoning include headache, loss of consciousness, dizziness, vomiting, and fatigue; in severe cases, seizures, dysrhythmias, coma, and death may occur. Examination may show red skin.

Transmission can occur through the ingestion of oocysts from cat feces or infected meat, direct transmission between a mother and fetus, or from organ transplantation, which leads to invasion followed by dissemination of the parasite where it typically lies dormant. It is a ubiquitous organism and nearly 10% of individuals will be seropositive for T gondii, but the parasite does not usually cause severe disease in immunocompetent individuals. In patients with HIV infection and CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/mm 3, however, reactivation can occur with several distinct clinical syndromes of which cerebral toxoplasmosis results in the most morbidity. Cerebral toxoplasmosis typically presents with multiple ring enhancing lesions scattered throughout the brain. Seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and systemic symptoms are common, as are signs of increased intracranial pressure. Patients with HIV infection and positive Toxop/asma lgG antibodies are typically treated empirically with a sulfonamide and pyrimethamine if cerebral toxoplasmosis is suspected, but confirmatory diagnosis occurs through a brain biopsy, which will show a dense infiltrate of lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells, along with the presence of the T gondii organism.

Imaging in immunocompromised patients more commonly shows multifocal disease, numerous, ring- or heterogeneously enhancing lesions throughout the corpus callosum, periventricular areas, and periependyma l regions. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow cytometry or cytology, with evidence of EBV DNA in the CSF supporting the diagnosis.

Fever can be associated with SAH and is associated with worse outcomes. CT scan of the head typically shows hyperdense blood products in the cerebral sulci and basal cisterns. However, the sensitivity of CT scan for SAH is lower with small volume bleeding or a delayed presentation. If there is strong suspicion for SAH with a negative CT scan, a lumbar puncture can be performed, which may show red blood cells or xanthochromia, which represents hemoglobin degradation products. As the blood products circulate within the subarachnoid space, complications include the development of communicating and/or obstructive hydrocephalus in the acute stage, along with the potential for re-bleeding and vasospasm in the days following the initial bleed.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient has developed delirium tremens, a serious complication of alcohol withdrawal. Alcohol increases the central nervous system activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. Abrupt discontinuation of alcohol results in imbalanced and unopposed sympathetic excess. Uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal typically presents with tremors, anxiety, restlessness, headache, nausea, and diaphoresis, which can begin within hours after the cessation of alcohol use. Delirium tremens, the most concerning and life-threatening complication of alcohol withdrawal, involves severe confusion and disorientation, fluctuations in consciousness, agitation, visual hallucinations, and autonomic instability (generally characterized by tachycardia, hypertension, and potentially hyperthermia). As in this patient, delirium tremens can begin 2 to 5 days after the patient's last alcoholic drink. Delirium tremens is managed supportively with benzodiazepines (GABAA receptor agonists) to address the psychomotor agitation associated with withdrawal and prevent the worsening of withdrawal manifestations. The specific benzodiazepines utilized include chlordiazepoxide, a long-acting benzodiazepine given on a scheduled basis in patients experiencing or at risk for complicated withdrawal (eg, delirium tremens), and/or lorazepam, a short-acting benzodiazepine given as-needed for withdrawal symptoms. Management also includes frequent assessments including vital sign checks, fluid resuscitation, and nutritional supplementation (especially with commonly deficient vitamins and minerals such as thiamine, potassium, and magnesium).",

Symptoms include lower extremity numbness, weakness, paralysis, hyporeflexia, perinea! anesthesia, fecal incontinence with poor rectal tone, and overflow incontinence marked by inability to void and urinary retention. Emergent MRI of the lumbosacral spine is indicated to investigate the cause of cauda equina syndrome, and to determine the necessity of surgical decompression. Initial treatment for patients with epidural spinal cord compression and neurologic deficits include symptomatic treatment, pain control, and glucocorticoid therapy prior to operative therapy. High-dose glucocorticoid therapy is helpful as a bridge to definitive therapy, can help control pain, and may transiently improve neurologic function secondary to decreasing edema at the site of cord compression.

A thrombus of the vertebral artery commonly forms from atherosclerotic disease but may also form as a result of an intimal defect from trauma or vertebra l artery dissection, a known complication of chiropractic manipu lation. The brain stem, cerebellum, and occipital lobes are common ly affected. Patients typically present with vestibu locerebe llar signs (eg, ataxia, dysmetria, dizziness, imbalance, vertigo, vomiting, nystagmus), ipsilateral cranial nerve dysfunction (eg, dysphagia, dysarthria, vertical or horizonta l gaze palsies), contralateral hemiparesis (caused by corticospinal tract damage), contralateral impairment in pain and temperature sensation (caused by spinothalamic tract damage), and/or contralateral homonymous hemianopsia with macular sparing (caused by posterior cerebral artery involvement). In posterior circulation strokes affecting the lateral pons, Horner syndrome may occur, which presents with unilateral ptosis and miosis (pupillary constriction) and ipsilateral facial anhidrosis. If no hemorrhage is shown on noncontrast CT scan of the head, acute management of posterior circulation strokes may involve tissue plasminogen activator therapy or thrombectomy. In dissection, antiplatelet and anticoagu lant administration is indicated to prevent conversion to a thromboembolic stroke if none has yet occurred.",

It is primarily seen in young women who are overweight.

Headaches that are secondary to increased intracranial pressure often are worse when lying down and relieved by standing. The most common risk factors for the development of pseudotumor cerebri include female gender and obesity. However, hypervitaminosis A from increased dietary intake is another potential cause of IIH.

It can also be associated with loss of taste on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and decreased lacrimation. Symptoms typically peak around 3 weeks, with slow recovery beginning within 6 months. Diagnosis is most commonly based on clinical symptoms, but electrodiagnostic tests, such as EMG, and imaging of the face and head can be utilized if the diagnosis is unclear.

Spinal stenosis describes narrowing of the central canal, neural foramen, or lateral recesses of the spine with consequent nerve compression. Common causes include degenerative arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, degenerative disc disease, hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum, and osteophyte formation in the facet joints. Lower back pain with radiation to the buttocks and lower extremities that results from increased nerve compression is called neurogenic claudication. It is exacerbated by extension of the spine during standing and walking downhill.

BPPV occurs when an otolith becomes dislodged from the utricle and enters the semicircular canals. Changes in head posture then cause the malpositioned otolith to move within the semicircular canals, stimulating abnormal movements in endolymph and causing a sensation of vertigo. Patients typically report symptoms of intense, brief episodes of vertigo that occur after changes in position (such as after rolling over or rising from bed), accompanied by visual disturbances (caused by nystagmus), nausea, and vomiting. Positional oculovestibular testing, such as the Dix-Hallpike test, allows the examiner to reproduce the patient's symptoms by repositioning the otolith. Further positional maneuvers, such as the Epley maneuver, can be used to move the malpositioned otolith to its proper position within the utricle.

Additionally, increased activity of the upstream enzyme, delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS1) leads to accumulation of ALA, which is also toxic.

It is a ubiquitous organism and nearly 10% of individuals will be seropositive for T gondii, but the parasite does not usually cause severe disease in immunocompetent individuals. In patients with HIV infection and CD4+ cell counts less than 100 cells/mm 3, however, reactivation can occur with several distinct clinical syndromes of which cerebral toxoplasmosis results in the most morbidity. Cerebral toxoplasmosis typically presents with multiple ring-enhancing lesions within the substance of the cerebral cortex, most commonly the frontal and parietal lobes, although single lesions can occur. It is commonly associated with cerebral edema, which may result in mass effect and shifting of adjacent structures. Seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and systemic symptoms are common, as are signs of increased intracranial pressure. Patients with HIV and positive toxoplasma lgG antibodies are typically treated empirically with a sulfonamide and pyrimethamine if cerebral toxoplasmosis is suspected.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Carotid sinus hypersensitivity syndrome is characterized by an exaggerated response to carotid baroreceptor stimulation, presenting with resultant sinus bradycardia, hypotension, and syncope. Baroreceptors located at the carotid bifurcations and the aortic arch are important in regulating cardiac output and maintaining adequate perfusion pressures to the brain and organs of the upper body. Baroreceptors are sensitive to mechanical pressure; normally, an increase in blood pressure stimulates baroreceptor activity, which activates a reflex arc resulting in parasympathetic innervation of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, and inhibition of sympathetic vascular tone. This results in a decreased heart rate and periphera l vascular resistance and may result in syncope, especially in older adults. In carotid sinus hypersensitivity syndrome, this response may be triggered by mechanical compression of the carotid sinus from external palpation or with movement of the muscles of the neck. Cardiac examination and diagnostic studies are often unrevealing.",

A hypotensive TIA typically lasts until resolution of the low-flow event while an embolic TIA lasts hours, as in this case. An embolic ischemic stroke involves an event in which a clot breaks off and travels to the brain, occluding blood flow within a cerebral artery. Emboli most commonly originate from proximal vessels, such as the internal carotid artery, or from an atrial thrombus. If the embolus successfully undergoes physiologic thrombolysis, blood flow is restored to the affected area and reverses the clinical symptoms.

Ocular examination demonstrates decreased visual acuity and color vision, a relative afferent pupillary defect (rAPD), and possibly optic disc edema. Diagnosis is confirmed with MRI demonstrating hyperintensity of the optic nerve. Patients with optic neuritis are at an increased risk for multiple sclerosis (MS), and optic neuritis is a common initial finding in patients with MS. Recently, autoantibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) have been identified as a causative factor of some cases of optic neuritis. Patients who develop optic neuritis because of antibodies against MOG and AQP4 often have severe presentations but also have a decreased risk for subsequent MS compared with patients with optic neuritis who lack these autoantibodies. The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial demonstrated that a short course of treatment with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone speeds the rate of visual recovery and delays the onset of MS, although it does not impact final visual acuity, and demonstrated that the presence and quantity of periventricular white matter lesions on MRI imaging is the most important prognostic risk factor for the subsequent development of MS.",

Involvement of the facial nucleus leads to facial droop caused by muscle paralysis, decreased lacrimation, decreased salivation, and decreased taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.

Patients may be asymptomatic, or they may experience seizures or focal neurologic deficits related to the tumor location. Meningiomas are typically benign but can be malignant. Malignant meningiomas may grow rapidly, leading to symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (postural headache, nausea, papilledema). Meningiomas appear as well-circumscribed, extra-axia l (outside of the brain parenchyma) masses that compress the underlying parenchyma. They demonstrate uniform enhancement on CT imaging. Definitive diagnosis requires histologic examination of the tissue, which will demonstrate spindle cells arranged in a whorled pattern with psammoma bodies.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cerebral infarctions, or strokes, occur as a result of ischemic or hemorrhagic loss of blood supply to the brain. Approximately 80% to 85% of strokes are ischemic, common ly arising from thromboembo lic disease, whereas 15% to 20% of strokes are hemorrhagic because of blood vessel rupture. Risk factors for stroke include smoking, hypertension, diabetes, carotid or intracranial atherosclerotic disease, history of hypercoagulability, atrial fibrillation, and advanced age. Classically, strokes manifest as a neurologic deficit related to the affected part of the brain. Occlusion of the left posterior cerebra l artery (PCA) explains this patient's deficits. The PCA supplies much of the occipita l lobes as well as the inferomedia l temporal lobe, posteromedia l parietal lobe, thalamus, and parts of the brainstem. Occlusion of the left PCA typically leads to right homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing (as a result of damage of the left primary visual cortex). Right homonymous hemianopia likely explains this patient's car accident. Occlusion of the left PCA may also result in right hemisensory deficit (caused by thalamus damage) and right hemiparesis (caused by damage to the cerebral peduncles in the midbrain). As well, damage to the left parietal cortex may occur and lead to agraphia, acalculia, finger agnosia, and left-right disorientation (Gerstmann syndrome).",

Pulmonary cryptococcosis typically presents with a low-grade, intermittent fever and nonspecific respiratory symptoms. Central nervous system involvement can cause headache, nuchal rigidity, photophobia, and progressive encephalopathy. Dermatologic spread can occur with pustular, papular, nodular, or ulcerated lesions. Diagnosis is made by analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sputum, urine, and/or blood. Histologic examination may show yeast cells with narrow-based budding and a bright red inner capsule on staining with mucicarmine or periodic acid-Schiff.

Hamartomas can form in the soft tissue (leading to Shagreen patches, or subcutaneous oval nodules) or brain (leading to epilepsy and intellectua l disability). Cardiac rhabdomyomas (leading to mitral regurgitation) and renal angiomyolipomas are also common. Other typical dermatologic findings include ash leaf spots (hypomelanotic macules) and angiofibromas, which are acneiform lesions without comedones (clogged hair follicles). Subependymal giant cell tumors are common, which typically demonstrate calcification and may increase the likelihood of developing seizures. Though these tumors are benign, patients are at risk for developing malignancies in the soft tissues, brain, or kidney. Diagnosis is typically clinical but may be confirmed by genetic testing indicating a mutated TSC gene.

Normally, action potentials lead to depolarization in the terminal bouton of the axon.

Patients with LEMS possess antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels on presynaptic lower motoneurons, which decreases calcium influx and the subsequent release of acetylcholine. This patient with a smoking history and proximal muscle weakness, with a known lung nodule, likely has paraneoplastic autoantibody production against voltage-gated calcium channels, causing LEMS in the setting of small cell lung cancer. Patients may also have depressed or absent deep tendon reflexes. The muscle weakness typically improves with exercise as small amounts of acetylcholine accumulate in the synaptic cleft over time, increasing the frequency of postsynaptic action potentials in skeletal muscle cells. This can be seen on nerve conduction studies, as well. Autonomic symptoms such as decreased salivation (and consequent dry mouth) may also occur. The diagnosis may be confirmed with nerve conduction studies and electromyography with exercise testing.

HPV is a nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA virus of the papillomaviridae family that causes genital warts. Infection with HPV is a significant and preventable risk factor for cervical, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancer. Administration of the HPV vaccine is recommended for both male and female patients between the ages of 9 and 26 years. For both sexes, it provides protection against genital warts, with the additional benefit of decreased cervical cancer risk in women. Meningococcal conjugate vaccine is indicated for all children, with an additional serogroup B vaccine indicated for all children over 10 years old at increased risk for meningococcal disease (eg, dormitory, military living). This would be appropriate in this patient who may attend college and participate in dormitory living. Although the patient received the diphtheria-tetanus toxoid (Td) at the age of 10 years, she will need the TdaP vaccine. Children receive a childhood series of immunization for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DTaP) involving pertussis antigens. The TdaP includes a tetanus toxoid, decreased diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis and is recommended for adolescents starting at age 11 years.",

While many causes of hypothyroidism exist, Hashimoto disease is a common cause of painless thyroiditis, which may present with a palpable, enlarged thyroid gland, as in this patient. With progressive inflammation and destruction of the thyroid parenchyma, circulating concentrations of thyroxine and triiodothyronine decrease, with resulting feedback on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary leading to increased concentrations of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and prolactin. The increased TSH concentration is measurable in serum and provides ongoing trophic stimulation to the thyroid gland. Increased prolactin may cause breast development, galactorrhea, and may promote irregular anovulatory cycles or amenorrhea through feedback on gonadotropin-releasing hormone.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) presents with a heart murmur described as a continuous \"machinery-like\" murmur best heard in the left second intercostal and left infraclavicular regions. Since blood flow through the PDA occurs in both systole and diastole, the sound will be present throughout the cardiac cycle. The ductus arteriosus is one of several physiologic shunts existing during the prenatal period. In utero, oxygenated blood is obtained from the placenta, not from the lungs, and the ductus arteriosus (DA) allows the shunting of oxygenated blood from the pulmonary artery directly to the aorta while bypassing the fetal lungs, which are filled with amniotic fluid. At birth, closure of the DA occurs by the release of prostaglandins and increased arterial oxygen tension. With increased blood oxygenation and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance following birth or with indomethacin use, prostaglandin production falls and the ductus closes. Certain congenital heart diseases require the presence of a shunt to allow arteriovenous admixture of oxygenated blood, for example, transposition of the great vessels. In the absence of such a requirement for shunting, a PDA results in a chronic extracardiac left-to-right shunt that may result in pulmonary hypertension or right-sided heart failure, with the risk for Eisenmenger syndrome if uncorrected. PDAs that are small often go undetected until adulthood because the left-to-right shunt is not significant enough to cause symptoms.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) presents with microcytic, hypochromic anemia with otherwise normal shape of red blood cells. IDA is extremely prevalent worldwide, especially in developing countries, in pregnant women, and in children. Infants and children are particularly vulnerable to IDA as a result of rapid growth and dietary deficiencies. The patient has been fed primarily cow's milk for the past 6 months, along with table food, while formula was stopped at 6 months of age. This places the infant at risk for iron deficiency given the insufficient amount of iron in cow's milk. Many types of formulas and foods are fortified with iron to ensure appropriate supplementation. Iron is required for the synthesis of heme, which is a necessary component of the hemoglobin molecule, and thus, of erythrocytes. It functions to shuttle oxygen to and from peripheral tissues. Erythrocytes on the peripheral blood smear are hypochromic as a result of deficient hemoglobin concentration. It is hypothesized  that erythrocytes are microcytic as a result of continuing erythrocyte division in order to reach an adequate hemoglobin concentration. Because hemoglobin stores are inadequate, cell division continues beyond what would normally occur and causes the cells to be smaller than normal. Treatment in the case of poor dietary intake is with oral iron supplementation. If severe, parenteral iron can be administered.",

Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma is a subcutaneous vascular mass that appears as a purpuric raised lesion, most commonly on the extremities. It also tends to become darker and indurated with time. Both of these vascular tumors are associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, which presents with bleeding, ecchymoses, and petechiae as a result of platelet sequestration by the tumor and an associated coagulopathy.

Initial evaluation requires an attempt at insertion of a nasogastric tube and evaluation of its position with a chest x-ray. If the nasogastric tube remains coiled within the esophagus, this suggests the presence of esophageal atresia. Air within the gastrointestinal tract immediately after birth and prior to feeding suggests the existence of a TEF distal to the esophageal atresia. Definitive management requires surgical repair.

Initial evaluation commonly includes a chest x-ray or CT scan, which will potentially outline the extent of the patient's mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Definitive diagnosis requires excisional lymph node biopsy, which will disclose Reed-Sternberg cells (atypical cells with bilobed nuclei), a large inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophilic predominance, and fibrosis.

The aspiration of acidic stomach contents may cause aspiration pneumonitis, whereas the aspiration of gastrointestinal flora and bacteria can cause aspiration pneumonia. The volume of aspirate is a strong predictor of complications from aspiration, especially in the case of pneumonia, as the bacterial inoculum may overwhelm the native ability of pulmonary alveolar defense (macrophages, cilia, mucus) to prevent colonization, replication, and infection. Aspiration pneumonia classically presents with a cough productive of foul-smelling sputum, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, and rhonchi on physical examination. Imaging classically shows an infiltrate in the most dependent lung segments at the time of aspiration (eg, in the superior segment of the inferior lobe when supine or lower lobes when erect). Patients at a higher risk for aspiration include those with impaired airway-protective reflexes (eg, neurological injury, myasthenia gravis, altered mental status), frequent or forceful emesis, abnormal pharyngeal or airway anatomy or function (eg, malignancy, tracheoesophageal fistula), or severe gastroesophageal reflux. Options for the management of severe gastroesophageal reflux in children include dietary changes and proton pump inhibitors or histamine- 2 receptor antagonists, although these would not assist in decreasing the risk for aspiration pneumonia.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The patient is most likely presenting with a malignant pleural effusion. His physical examination findings of jugular venous distention and edema of the face and upper extremities are suggestive of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, which is caused by obstruction of the SVC and venous congestion of the upper body and face. Obstruction of the SVC is often caused by extrinsic compression by a malignant mediastinal or pulmonary mass, which may be secondary to lung cancer, lymphoma, or metastatic disease from another primary source. Pleural effusions are clinically suspected on examination in the setting of dullness to percussion and diminished breath sounds, and can be visualized on imaging including chest x-ray, CT scan, or ultrasonography. Analyzing the pleural fluid can show an underlying cause to guide therapy. Fluid is inspected for cell counts, organisms, pH, enzyme activity, and serum glucose concentration and total protein concentrations. Low pH and low serum glucose are indicative of increased cellular metabolism in the fluid and may indicate underlying malignancy and/or infection. Malignant pleural effusions may have increased erythrocyte counts or appear grossly hemorrhagic as a result of tumor invasion and disruption of blood vessels and the visceral pleura. As well, Light criteria assesses whether the pleural effusion is likely to be exudative (eg, complex fluid resulting from pneumonia, empyema, malignancy, or inflammatory disease) or transudative (eg, serous fluid resulting from imbalanced hydrostatic or oncotic pressures) through evaluating the concentrations of pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase.",

Transient synovitis is an inflammatory condition involving the synovial lining of weight-bearing joints, with the hip being commonly affected. It classically presents in children recovering from a viral infection with pain on weight-bearing, antalgic gait, refusal to ambulate, tenderness over the joint, and pain elicited with range of motion. Vital signs are generally within normal limits, as are laboratory studies with the exception of increased markers of inflammation such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Antecedent viral infection has been reported in up to 30% of cases of transient synovitis. Diagnosis involves the exclusion of emergent or urgent conditions such as cellulitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and fracture. Treatment is supportive, and involves rest plus nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, making oral ibuprofen the best choice for this patient.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "lntussusception occurs when a segment of bowel telescopes into an adjacent segment, resulting in colicky abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and potential bloody, mucoid stools. Classically, it presents in an infant or young child with recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain often punctuated by asymptomatic periods. lntussusception typically occurs as a result of the presence of a pathologic lead point, often lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphadenopathy, Meckel diverticulum, stricture, or malignancy, which acts to draw one segment of bowel into an adjacent segment during peristalsis. If the intussusception self-resolves, there may be no symptoms. If it does not resolve, traction on mesenteric vessels can result in hypoperfusion of the segment with resultant inflammation, hemorrhage, obstruction, and pain. It may be detected on physical examination as an elongated mass, often in the right upper quadrant. Diagnosis consists of clinical history and physical examination and is supported by imaging. Ultrasonography evaluation is preferred in young children and will show telescoping interposed bowel segments in longitudinal orientation or a targetoid appearance in transverse orientation. Treatment of an ileocolic intussusception requires the administration of a contrast enema, which decreases the intussusception. Contrast enema is both diagnostic and therapeutic in this setting. Surgery may be required in cases where there is repetitive failure of the enema to decrease the intussusception or if the patient presents with symptoms concerning for bowel necrosis or perforation.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Puberty in boys typically follows a predictable course of gonadarche (enlargement of the testes), followed by pubarche (pubic hair), followed by adrenarche (axillary hair, facial hair, voice changes), followed by a growth spurt. This differs from the process in girls, which proceeds from thelarche (breast buds) to pubarche to growth spurt and finally menarche. In boys, delayed puberty is defined as the absence of testicular enlargement or secondary sexual characteristics at the age of 14 years. The most common cause of delayed puberty is constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), accounting for approximately 50% of cases, a normal variant. In CDGP, there is a transient defect in the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone with resultant delay in the stimulation of pituitary production of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. CDGP tends to be familial with many members of the same family undergoing late puberty compared with peers. In this case, the patient has undergone gonadarche (indicated by his Tanner stage 2 genital development) and pubarche but has not yet undergone adrenarche. Thus, while delayed, the sequence of his procession through the steps of puberty is appropriate and he can be reassured that his development will continue to progress.",

If his puberty did not continue to progress, testosterone measurement could be used to differentiate CDGP from another pathology.

Extracellular hyperglycemia creates an osmotic effect resulting in the shift of fluid from the intracellular to the extracellular space with accompanying profuse osmotic diuresis and intracellular volume loss. Patients present with signs and symptoms including tachycardia, tachypnea, fatigue, polyuria, shortness of breath, Kussmaul respiration, and diffuse abdominal discomfort. Laboratory evaluation typically shows increased concentrations of glucose, ketones, and a high anion-gap metabolic acidosis caused by the accumulation of unmeasured anions (ketones, lactic acid) in serum. Treatment is through the replacement of insulin, volume repletion, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions. Insulin is typically repleted at an initial dose of 0.1 U/kg/hour by intravenous infusion. Volume resuscitation with 0.9% saline is essential to restore intracellular fluid volume and lower the extracellular glucose concentration and is the initial step in the management of DKA even prior to insulin administration.

It is more common in children than adults. It characteristically presents with a prodromal fever along with cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and a confluent maculopapular rash that starts at the head/neck and spreads to the trunk, excluding the palms and soles. Physical examination may show bright red macules with a bluish-white center on the buccal mucosa (Koplik spots) and lymphadenopathy. Treatment is supportive. Vitamin A deficiency is associated with severe disease and complications, and supplementation should be provided, especially in children who are malnourished.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Neonatal jaundice is defined as an increased bilirubin concentration (greater than 5 mg/dl), which results from either increased hemolysis {bilirubin generation) or decreased bilirubin conjugation or excretion. Hyperbilirubinemia can be divided into direct and indirect forms in which either conjugated or unconjugated bilirubin accumulate, respectively. It can also be divided into physiologic and pathologic forms. Features of physiologic jaundice include development after 24 hours of life, a rate of bilirubin rise of less than 0.5 mg/dl daily, a maximum peak of 14 to 15 mg/dl, and a predominance of indirect bilirubin (greater than 90%). In contrast, jaundice within the first 24 hours of life {which rises faster than 0.5 mg/dl per hour), a predominance of direct bilirubin, and persistence beyond 2 weeks would suggest a pathologic cause. Newborn physiologic jaundice, also termed benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, occurs in nearly all newborns and is caused by the increased breakdown of red blood cells and thus generation of bilirubin, the immature liver metabolism of bilirubin, and the increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. These features taken together cause an indirect hyperbilirubinemia to develop. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is closely monitored in order to prevent kernicterus, which refers to the deposition of bilirubin in the basal ganglia, pons, and cerebellum. This can occur at bilirubin concentrations of 25 to 30 mg/dl. Treatment of the underlying cause of the jaundice and phototherapy for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia or exchange transfusion prevents this potentially fatal consequence. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. ABO isoimmunization {Choice A) occurs when maternal lgG antibodies to fetal red blood cell antigens cause either fetal or neonatal destruction of these red blood cells. Bilirubin production is increased, and an indirect hyperbilirubinemia ensues. This cause of neonatal jaundice will present with pathologic findings such as an early presentation and rapid rate of rise, neither of which are present in this case. Biliary obstruction {Choice B) caused by biliary atresia is a common cause of direct hyperbilirubinemia. In congenital biliary atresia, the common bile duct is occluded or atretic and bile is unable to pass into the duodenum. Dehydration {Choice C) is the mechanism behind breastfeeding jaundice. In the first week of life, as a breastfeeding mother's milk begins to establish, the infant may become dehydrated. Dehydration leads to increased enterohepatic circulation and reabsorption of bilirubin, resulting in indirect hyperbilirubinemia. In this case, the infant's consistent wet diapers and stools argue against a dehydrated state. Erythrocyte enzyme defect {Choice D) such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency causes increased hemolysis of red blood cells and a subsequent increase in unconjugated bilirubin.

Varicella zoster virus infection (VZV), also known as human herpesvirus-3 (HHV-3), is transmitted via respiratory secretions and direct contact with infected skin lesions. It causes two diseases: varicella and herpes zoster. Varicella causes chickenpox in immunocompetent children which is characterized by a pruritic, asynchronous rash with fluid-filled vesicles that crust. The vesicles heal as crusted papules and lesions are in various stages of healing. Varicella can cause encephalitis and pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients, such as an individual being treated with chemotherapy. Herpes zoster is caused by the recurrence of VZV after it has been reactivated from its dormancy in the dorsal root ganglion of a spinal nerve. It commonly presents as a unilateral, dermatomal erythematous patch with overlying clear to yellow, grouped vesicles. It can be associated with neuropathic pain which can precede and outlast the rash. However, post-herpetic neuralgia is more common in elderly patients than pediatric patients. The thoracic spinal nerves and trigeminal nerve are particularly common distributions of reactivation. Treatment for herpetic infections, including herpes zoster infections, involves medications that inhibit viral DNA polymerase, classically by guanosine analogs such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) typically occurs in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus as a result of increased insulin requirements during times of physiologic stress (eg, infection) or insulin nonadherence. DKA occurs as a result of the accumulation of serum ketones in the setting of deficient insulin signaling. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs because of the relative state of starvation created through absent insulin signaling. Patients may present with complaints of fatigue, polyuria, shortness of breath, and diffuse abdominal discomfort. Vital signs may show tachycardia and tachypnea. Laboratory studies typically show increased glucose and ketone concentrations, metabolic acidosis, and a high anion-gap caused by the accumulation of unmeasured anions in serum. In metabolic acidosis, excess hydrogen ions are transported into the cell in exchange for potassium ions to maintain electroneutrality. Insulin promotes intracellular potassium entry, and in DKA, insulin deficiency contributes to the excess cellular shift of potassium to the extracellular space resulting in hyperkalemia despite decreased concentrations of total body potassium as a result of excess urinary excretion. Treatment is through replacement of insulin, volume repletion, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Adrenal insufficiency (Choice A) refers to insufficient production of hormones from the adrenal cortex, which include aldosterone and cortisol; sex hormone deficiency may also be present. Primary adrenal insufficiency can present with deficiencies in both aldosterone and cortisol, whereas secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency tend to affect cortisol only. Insufficient aldosterone production leads to hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Insufficient cortisol can lead to hypoglycemia, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, and depressed mental status. In this patient, DKA is more likely given his history of type 1 diabetes, metabolic acidosis, and hyperglycemia. Excessive potassium intake (Choice C) would be unlikely to cause hyperkalemia in this patient. Kidney potassium filtration typically regulates serum potassium within a normal range, but this can be impaired in end stage kidney disease. In DKA, the kidney excretion of potassium is increased because of osmotic diuresis. Hyperkalemia in this case is as a result of the extracellular shift of potassium and deficient insulin signaling. Hemolysis (Choice D) can result in hyperkalemia because of the release of intracellular potassium into the serum. DKA is unlikely to cause hemolysis. Hemolytic anemia may present with jaundice and increased bilirubin. Respiratory acidosis (Choice E) would be the opposite of what is expected in a patient with DKA. In DKA, metabolic acidosis leads to compensatory respiratory alkalosis. Kussmaul respirations, which are rapid and deep, are a classic physical examination finding.",

Results of laboratory studies will be within reference ranges in pubertal gynecomastia but could be used to delineate other causes of gynecomastia. These other causes include medications (eg, spironolactone, ketoconazole, antiandrogen therapy), liver cirrhosis, germ cell tumors, hypogonadism, and hyperthyroidism.

Compared to normal skin, within a nevus the melanocytes are clustered into nests. Nests are either located in the basal layer of the epidermis, in the dermis, or both. Compared to acquired nevi, CMN are often larger and darker. CMN are classified by their size: small (<1.5 cm), medium (1.5-20 cm), large (>20-40 cm), and giant (>40 cm). Large and giant CMN are at risk for malignant transformation. In this case, the CMN is symmetrical, uniform in color and thickness, and appears to have a rough texture. Hair is present on the inferior aspect which is common in CMN. CMN should be routinely monitored by a dermatologist. If an area within the CMN develops increased thickness or change in color, it should be biopsied to evaluate for presence of melanoma. Provided the CMN does not develop melanoma, they are benign. However, they can be associated with psychological morbidity if they are located in cosmetically sensitive areas of the body and depending on their size.

The rash is initially characterized by erythematous papules and vesicles with exudates and crusting. With chronic scratching, they become dry, scaly, and excoriated in a process called lichenification. This patient's flexural dermatitis and apparent asthma and hay fever suggest a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis. Treatment of atopic dermatitis begins with gentle skin care: minimizing long baths in warm water which causes drying of the skin, avoiding products with fragrance, and use of bland moisturizers such as petroleum jelly daily. Flares of eczema are treated with mild to moderate potency topical corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone.

Selective lgA deficiency describes a decreased or absent concentration of circulating lgA with normal concentrations of lgG, and normal or increased concentrations of lgM. lgA is critical for immune health and functions in two primary ways. First, lgA binds pathogen surface antigens targeting them for opsonization, complement activation, and phagocytosis. Second, lgA coats mucosal surfaces and prevents colonization, adhesion, and invasion by pathogenic microorganisms. lmmunoglobulins are produced by plasma cells, which are terminally differentiated B lymphocytes; as a result, most causal deficiencies are hypothesized to be related to B lymphocyte abnormalities. Despite this, there is clinical heterogeneity in the severity of lgA deficiency. Some patients remain asymptomatic while others suffer from recurrent sinopulmonary infections or otitis media, as is the case for this patient. In younger patients with severe deficiency, failure to thrive is common. Anaphylactic reactions to blood products such as plasma (which contain donor immunoglobulin) are classic but uncommon, as not all patients with lgA deficiency have reactions to blood products. Such severe reactions are most common in patients with undetectable concentrations of lgA; these reactions occur because of the presence of preformed antibodies against lgA, which is a non-native protein in these patients, and thus, a target of immune activation.",

Thalassemia is characterized by the decreased synthesis of globin chains. Normal adult hemoglobin is known as HbA (a~2l and is made of two a-globin chains and two ~-globin chains. There are four a-globin alleles and two ~-globin alleles. Mutations in one or two a-globin alleles or one ~-globin allele causes thalassemia minor. Thalassemia trait is common in Southeast Asia and presents with mild microcytic anemia. Features include the presence of target cells on peripheral blood smear (pictured in the photomicrograph above), a low RDW (which indicates that most erythrocytes are of the same size with little variation), and persistence of microcytosis. Iron concentrations can be measured to rule out iron deficiency. Other cell lines including platelets and white blood cells should be within normal ranges. Hemoglobin electrophoresis can be used to distinguish between a- and ~-thalassemia minor. There is no treatment required for thalassemia minor as the resultant anemia is usually not severe. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Antibiotic-induced autoimmune hemolysis (Choice A) can occur after exposure to penicillins and cephalosporins, but the onset is typically acute and occurs within hours to days. While hemolysis can occur weeks later, it is less common. Additionally, patients would be expected to present with normocytic anemia and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Haptoglobin concentrations can be measured and will be decreased, while the reticulocyte count will typically be increased. Iron deficiency (Choice C) is a common cause of anemia in menstruating women, strict vegans or vegetarians, and those with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding or Celiac disease. It commonly presents with microcytosis, although often with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) that is higher than what is seen in thalassemia, and an increased RDW indicating the release of premature erythrocytes, which are larger, from the bone marrow. The measurement of serum iron and ferritin are used to make the diagnosis. Transient postinfectious bone marrow suppression (Choice D) may occur following viral infections, but more commonly presents with leukopenia, which is not present in this case.

Serum complement concentrations, including C3, are typically within reference ranges.

Appropriate treatment of the streptococcal infection with antibiotics does not reduce the likelihood of subsequently developing PSGN. PSGN is caused by a type Ill hypersensitivity reaction with the kidney deposition of immune complexes and complement. Patients typically present with dark colored urine, hypertension, and peripheral and periorbital edema. Urinalysis typically shows red blood cell casts.

Symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, lethargy, lightheadedness, and in severe cases, arrhythmia, seizure, and multisystem organ failure. Vital signs typically show reduced oxygen saturation, and examination may disclose cyanosis. Characteristically, blood appears darkened on gross visualization, although hemoglobin concentration and erythrocyte morphology are normal.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient with generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, diarrhea, and hepatosplenomegaly with leukopenia most likely has acute HIV infection, known as acute retroviral syndrome. The presentation of primary HIV infection can vary significantly between patients, with some experiencing a mild febrile illness while others experience a severe, mononucleosis-like viral syndrome. The time between infection and onset of symptoms is variable, with incubation time lasting several weeks to months. During acute infection, there is a high degree of viral replication followed by widespread infection of CD4+ T lymphocytes. While the T lymphocyte count may decrease transiently, it is often within reference ranges in early HIV infection unless patients present with signs of opportunistic infection. Initial laboratory studies include the use of a fourth generation HIV test, which tests for HIV p24 antigen and antibodies, combined with direct measurement of the HIV viral load using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. It is common in early infection for patients to have a negative fourth generation test but a high viral load; this is known as the window period. Once the diagnosis is made, laboratory studies should be sent for mutational analysis and genotyping, but this should not delay immediate treatment with antiretroviral therapy. Therapy typically includes a combination of at least three different medications from at least two different antiretroviral classes. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, E, and F. Common variable immunodeficiency (Choice A) classically presents between the ages of 20 to 40 years as multiple, recurrent sinus or pulmonary infections, including pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinusitis. Testing will disclose low immunoglobulin concentrations. Selective lgA deficiency (Choice C) describes an absence of lgA with normal concentrations of lgG, and normal or increased concentrations of lgM. Many patients are asymptomatic and do not demonstrate a history of recurrent infections.

Human placental lactogen produced by the placenta increases maternal insulin resistance.

Fetal hyperglycemia in turn causes the fetus to produce excess insulin, with a consequent decrease in the rate of gluconeogenesis. The insulin then acts as a growth factor, leading to macrosomia, and inhibits the production of surfactant, which leads to respiratory distress syndrome. After birth, the fetus continues to synthesize insulin but is no longer exposed to maternal blood glucose concentrations, leading to hypoglycemia.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Meningitis presents with fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status, typically following a prodrome of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, although it can also be concomitant with another infection. It is caused by bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens, although bacterial pathogens usually cause the most acute and severe illness. Physical examination will commonly show a positive Kernig or Brudzinski sign, indicative of meningeal irritation, and can also disclose focal neurologic symptoms or signs of increased intracranial pressure, such as hemiparesis or a sixth cranial nerve palsy. Results of laboratory studies will show leukocytosis, and coagulation studies can show signs of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia, decreased fibrinogen, and increased depending on the specific pathogen. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation is the initial diagnostic step and will show an increased opening pressure, increased white blood cell count with prominent neutrophils, increased protein concentration, and decreased glucose concentration in bacterial meningitis. Culture of the CSF is utilized to diagnose the specific bacterial cause. The most common cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults is Streptococcus pneumoniae, although its incidence has decreased with the pneumococcal vaccine. Risk factors for its development include an immunocompromised state, diabetes mellitus, and chronic heart or lung disease. Treatment involves immediate antibiotic therapy, accompanied by glucocorticoids. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. Cryptococcal meningitis {Choice A) is a fungal meningitis that occurs most commonly in immunocompromised patients, such as those with lymphoma, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or solid organ transplantation. Cryptococcus neoformans can also cause encephalitis and pulmonary cryptococcosis. However, fungal meningitis will show prominent lymphocytes on CSF evaluation, rather than a predominance of neutrophils, as in this patient. Enterovirus meningitis {Choice B) more commonly occurs in patients less than one year of age but can present in children and young adults. Viral meningitis is associated with a normal opening pressure, predominance of lymphocytes, and normal protein and glucose concentrations on CSF evaluation. Herpes simplex encephalitis {Choice C) presents in patients of all ages with fever, headache, seizures, focal neurologic signs, and confusion. Herpes simplex is commonly associated with a significant amount of red blood cells on CSF evaluation, as well as neuroimaging that shows inflammation in the temporal lobe. Neurocysticercosis {Choice D) is an infection caused by the parasitic pork tapeworm Taenia solium that occurs most commonly in endemic rural regions of Latin America, Asia, and Africa.

These disorders are often subdivided into cyanotic and non-cyanotic\ntypes depending on the direction of blood shunting. Structural heart defects that result in flow of deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary to systemic circulations (a right-to-left shunt) classically present with cyanosis,\nrespiratory distress, hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension generally within a few days of birth. Common culprit lesions include truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great vessels, tricuspid atresia, tetralogy of\nFallo!, and total anomalous pulmonary venous return. Left-to-right shunting occurs with ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, and patent ductus arteriosus.

The lungs fail to mature properly, and patients develop chronic lung disease\ncharacterized by decreased lung volumes, hyperinflation, and atelectasis.\nCystic fibrosis (Choice D) can result in cyanosis as a result of chronic lung infections with obstruction and chronic inflammatory changes to the lung parenchyma. Patients typically present with recurrent pneumonia and\ngastrointestinal symptoms.\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Choice E) is a congenital heart condition characterized by myocardial thickening and left outflow tract obstruction. Patients typically present with a murmur and may develop diastolic dysfunction .\nIdiopathic pulmonary hypertension (Choice F) is a rare pulmonary disorder with an unknown cause characterized by progressive pulmonary vascular hypertension. Persistent pulmonary hypertension (Choice I) with any cause\nmay result in right heart failure. Patients typically present with exertional dyspnea and physical examination findings suggestive of right heart failure.\nMethemoglobinemia (Choice G) is the accumulation of hemoglobin with an oxidized iron atom that is unable to transport oxygen, resulting in hypoxia. Infants are more susceptible than adults. It is associated with exposure to\nan oxidizing agent.\nPatent foramen ovale (Choice H) is a common form of atrial septal defect that is typically asymptomatic but can result in a left-to-right shunt and potential for systemic embolization of venous thromboses.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Anaphylactic shock, a severe type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, presents following exposure to an allergen. It is caused by widespread lgE-mediated mast cell degranulation and is characterized by histaminergic responses within multiple organ systems leading to flushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and vasodilation, which can lead to airway obstruction and circulatory collapse. If not managed promptly, death can occur from hypoxia or distributive shock. Anaphylaxis is a form of distributive shock, which is characterized by a primary reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR).

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Galactosemia is the most likely diagnosis in this exclusively breast-fed patient with hepatomegaly and the presence of reducing substances in the urine. Normal metabolism of lactose involves separation into glucose and galactose by lactase. Free glucose can be used for cellular energy production while galactose must be converted to galactose-1-phosphate by galactokinase and then subsequently converted to UDP-galactose and then glucose-1-phosphate by galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT). While galactosemia can result from deficiencies in several different enzymes in this pathway, deficiency of GALT causes classic galactosemia, which is an autosomal recessive disorder. Breast milk contains galactose, which patients with galactosemia are unable to break down. Early complications include jaundice, vomiting, hepatomegaly, diarrhea, lethargy, and occasionally sepsis with Gram-negative organisms. Coagulopathy and easy bruising may also occur. Diagnosis is made by assessing for the presence and activity of GALT in erythrocytes by radioimmunoassay. Reducing substances are molecules that can convert cupric to cuprous ions in the urine and include glucose, lactose, pentose, and galactose. The presence of these substances (galactose) can suggest the diagnosis but is not specific. Additionally, while galactosemia is detected on newborn screening, manifestations of the disease can occur before the results of screening are available. Treatment requires eliminating dietary galactose and providing necessary supplements, however, this may not reverse neurologic sequelae of the disease, such as infantile cataracts and intellectual disability.",

Giardiasis is usually acquired through the ingestion of cysts in contaminated water, which then mature into trophozoites in the small bowel. Parasitic overgrowth of the small bowel leads to the intestinal malabsorption of fats and carbohydrates. Giardiasis presents with persistent diarrhea that is foul-smelling and fatty, as well as abdominal pain, bloating, cramping, and weight loss. Children and infants are more likely than adults to present with dehydration and may experience failure to thrive as a result of malnutrition secondary to malabsorption. Diagnosis is made with stool culture, microscopy, or stool antigen testing. Light microscopy shows a flagellated, pear-shaped trophozoite with two large, central nuclei, and a medial axostyle.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Athletes are at increased risk for heat exhaustion as a result of strenuous exercise in hot temperatures and increased humidity. Other risk factors include lack of acclimatization, obesity, dehydration, and poor physical fitness. During exertion, the body is able to dissipate heat by increasing blood flow to skin and producing sweat to facilitate evaporative cooling. However, when ambient temperature is increased and humidity is high, these mechanisms are less effective at dissipating heat, resulting in heat exhaustion. Heat exhaustion is characterized by exercise intolerance, increased core body temperature, and the absence of neurologic disturbances (eg, altered mental status, confusion, or seizure). It is also associated with dehydration, tachycardia, lightheadedness, muscle cramps, and generalized weakness. Neurologic disturbances are associated with a more severe form of exertional heat illness referred to as heat stroke. Management of heat exhaustion involves removing the individual from the heat, removing excess clothing, and initiating cooling measures such as immersion in cool water or evaporative cooling.",

However, healthy individuals are typically able to maintain a stable serum glucose concentration because of hepatic glycogenolysis during periods of exercise and fasting. Hypoglycemia would not cause hyperthermia. Hyponatremic dehydration {",
        "D": "can occur in subacute or chronic severe vomiting and diarrhea as a result of the loss of electrolytes, including sodium, and water. Dehydration increases the action of antidiuretic hormone, leading to increased free water reabsorption in the collecting tubule and can further contribute to hyponatremia. Malignant hyperthermia {",

Increasing amounts of trapped air in the pleural space compresses the lung parenchyma, creating an inability for the lung to expand and causing it to collapse. As the pneumothorax progresses and continues to increase in size, it can result in tracheal or mediastinal deviation away from the affected hemithorax. It can also result in compression of the pulmonary veins and superior vena cava, decreasing venous return to the left and right atria, which manifests with hypotension, jugular venous distension, and obstructive shock. Tension pneumothorax is characterized by absent breath sounds and hyperresonance to percussion caused by increased air in the intrathoracic space displacing normal lung parenchyma.

It antagonizes NMDA receptors leading to excitatory neurotransmitter release, inhibits reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, and stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors. Acute PCP intoxication can lead to psychosis, bizarre behavior, agitation, aggression, rotatory nystagmus, and ataxia. Patients may be diaphoretic, tachycardic, and hypertensive because of sympathomimetic effects. Chronic PCP use can lead to major depressive disorder, psychotic symptoms, memory loss, and dysarthria. Control of psychomotor agitation is the first step in management of patients with PCP intoxication for the safety of the patient and medical staff. Chemical sedation with benzodiazepines such as intramuscular lorazepam or midazolam can be administered to control symptoms. Once a patient is adequately sedated, further evaluation can be completed to assess for traumatic injuries or complications of PCP intoxication such as rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, hypertension, seizures, encephalopathy, or a comatose state.",

Type 1 diabetes mellitus can also be complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and patients can present with DKA as their initial manifestation. DKA can also result from increased insulin requirements during times of physiologic stress (eg, infection) or insulin nonadherence. DKA occurs as a result of the accumulation of serum ketones such as beta-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone in the setting of deficient insulin signaling. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs because of the relative state of starvation created through absent insulin signaling. Type 1 diabetes mellitus can also result in dehydration caused by hyperglycemia, glucosuria, and osmotic diuresis. This diuresis can result in dehydration, ketonuria, and orthostasis. Orthostatic vital signs are significant pulse increases greater than 20/min, systolic pressure decreases over 20 mm Hg, or diastolic pressure decreases over 10 mm Hg with changes in position from supine to seated to standing. Because of the patient's osmotic diuresis, orthostatic hypotension, and dehydration, the first step in care requires the administration of 0.9% saline intravenously for fluid resuscitation.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a defect in adrenal steroid biosynthesis, particularly of cortisol, with variable effects on mineralocorticoids and androgens. Because of decreased production of hormones, the adrenal gland is stimulated by the pituitary in an attempt to increase hormone production, leading to adrenal hyperplasia, the namesake of this condition. The most common form of CAH and the cause of this patient's manifestations is 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase deficiency presents with salt wasting in a newborn or precocious puberty in a child, as well as virilization of infants with an XX karyotype (eg, clitoral hypertrophy, labial fusion), caused by increased concentrations of androgens. Because of the enzyme deficiency, concentrations of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone are increased, while aldosterone and cortisol are decreased, leading to hypotension, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (caused by inadequate cortisol). Diffuse hyperpigmentation of the skin, as seen in this newborn, is characteristic. Melanin production is regulated in part by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). MSH is a byproduct of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) which also produces adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In adrenal insufficiency, stimulation of ACTH production by POMC simultaneously produces MSH, leading to diffuse hyperpigmentation in affected patients. Treatment of CAH consists of exogenous glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid supplementation.",

When infection spreads to the fallopian tubes and ovaries, PID with purulent cervical discharge, uterine and adnexal tenderness, and systemic symptoms such as fever can result. If left untreated, PID can become complicated by a tuba-ovarian abscess or intraabdominal abscess, presenting with focal tenderness and a fluctuant mass; it can cause consequent infertility. Gonorrhea can present with dissemination (tenosynovitis, dermatitis, polyarthralgia) or reactive arthritis. Risk factors for the development of gonorrhea include multiple sexual partners, new sexual partners, receptive anal intercourse, a young age, substance abuse, and inconsistent condom usage.

When torsed, the appendix testis may appear as a small blue or black mass in the scrotum.

Rheumatic fever is a sequela of untreated group A Streptococcus infection, commonly pharyngitis, in which there is a type II hypersensitivity reaction to self-antigens having a similar structure to, and thus molecularly mimicking streptococcal M protein. Diagnosis is made by the Jones criteria, which describe many of the core clinical features of rheumatic fever. The major criteria include polyarthritis, carditis, subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum, and Sydenham chorea; the minor criteria include fever, leukocytosis, arthralgia, and PR interval prolongation. Patients often have an increased antistreptolysin O titer. Biopsy of affected cardiac tissue discloses a granulomatous reaction with presence of Aschoff bodies. Complications of rheumatic fever include mitral valve inflammation leading to long-term sequelae of chronic mitral valve regurgitation, prolapse, or stenosis. Treatment of the initial streptococcal infection is effective for reducing the risk for developing rheumatic fever. Per American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, once rheumatic fever has developed, treatment includes salicylates and a prolonged course of monthly penicillin treatments to reduce the risk for recurrence and further valvular damage.",

Retinoblastoma is a malignant proliferation of retinal neuroendocrine cells and is the most common ophthalmic malignancy in children. Retinoblastoma results from inactivating mutations of both copies of the RB1 gene, which functions as a tumor suppressor by halting cell cycle progression at the G1 checkpoint. RB1 mutations may be either acquired or inherited. In cases of germline RB1 mutation, a single mutated allele is inherited, and the second allele acquires a subsequent mutation during development. Infants who carry germline mutations are more likely to have bilateral retinoblastoma with multiple foci of tumors in the eye, whereas infants with two acquired mutations are more likely to have unilateral retinoblastoma. Ultrasound of the eye is helpful for defining the size of the lesion and for detecting characteristic intralesional calcifications. Within the eye, large tumor size, tumor seeding of the vitreous humor, and involvement of the iris or anterior chamber are associated with a worse prognosis. If undetected, retinoblastoma may invade the optic nerve, leading to a greater risk for metastasis to the brain. Most cases of retinoblastoma may be successfully managed with chemotherapy, although advanced cases may require enucleation with special attention paid to achieving negative margins at the optic nerve, as cases that have undergone metastasis have a poor prognosis.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Wheezing that does not improve with nebulized albuterol, hyperinflation of the right lung, and acute onset of difficulty breathing and cough raises suspicion for foreign body aspiration. Foreign body aspiration can cause obstruction of the airway, leading to impaired oxygenation and ventilation. Children from 1 to 3 years old are at increased risk for foreign body aspiration because of their ability to stand and mobilize independently, ability to grasp and put small objects into their mouths, and an immature swallowing mechanism. Foreign bodies can be located anywhere in the airway between the larynx and the bronchi. Children can present with severe respiratory distress, cyanosis, and stridor, or may have a less severe presentation with partial airway obstruction, presenting with cough, tachypnea, decreased air entry on auscultation, or wheezing. Chest x-ray can show hyperinflation of one lung, which is caused by air trapping and partial airway obstruction in which air is able to pass via inspiration, but not exhalation. Foreign bodies are typically in the right lung because of the more vertical anatomic position of the right main bronchus. Management of foreign body aspiration involves flexible or rigid bronchoscopy to remove the object. Object removal is necessary and retained foreign bodies can be complicated by airway inflammation and infection.",

The classic presentation includes slow onset of hip pain which is worsened by activity and associated with a limp. The pain may or may not be relieved with rest. X-rays often show no abnormalities. However, bone scan characteristically shows decreased perfusion of the femoral head, as in this case. MRI may also be considered for diagnosis and will show bone marrow changes.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Meningitis in infants is commonly caused by bacteria and can present with fever or hypothermia, lethargy, irritability, altered mental status, a bulging fontanelle, poor feeding, and seizures. Diagnosis of meningitis typically involves lumbar puncture, and evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid will show an increased white blood cell count with predominant neutrophils, increased protein, and decreased glucose. Thorough evaluation also includes a complete blood count, blood culture, and urine culture to evaluate for other causes of sepsis, as well as culture of the cerebrospinal fluid to determine the causative organism. This patient has signs of sepsis, a systemic inflammatory syndrome that may occur in response to infection. Sepsis can be complicated by shock and multiorgan failure with a high mortality rate. Septic shock is characterized by vasoplegia (impaired response of the vasculature to vasoconstricting stimuli) with markedly decreased systemic vascular resistance, tachycardia, increased cardiac output, oliguria, and lactic acidosis. The initial step for management in septic shock involves emergency antibiotics and fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids, such as 0.9% saline. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "HIV infection, acquired via vertical transmission from the patient's mother, is the most likely cause of the patient's recurrent pneumococcal pneumonia, otitis media, and herpes zoster infection with axillary lymphadenopathy. HIV transmission may occur at any time during gestation but is most commonly acquired at or around the time of delivery and in the immediate postpartum period during breastfeeding. Transmission is uncommon if the mother is taking antiretroviral therapy and has a decreased HIV viral load. As a result of screening for HIV in most developed countries, the incidence of perinatal and pediatric HIV infection has decreased, although this is not true around the world. While many pediatric patients with perinatally acquired HIV infection will manifest symptoms within the first few months to years, it has been recognized that a subpopulation of patients will not develop symptoms or AIDS-defining conditions until many years later, as in this case. Symptoms in children are non-specific, and AIDS-defining conditions in children younger than six vary slightly from those in older children and adults. Clues to the diagnosis in this case include the presence of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in the patient's mother, which is an AIDS-defining illness and should prompt evaluation for HIV infection in this patient.",

Pertussis classically presents in three stages. The catarrhal stage is first, which presents with fever, rhinorrhea, and a mild cough. This progresses to the paroxysmal stage after 1 to 2 weeks, in which patients experience violent bouts of extreme coughing, at times violent enough to cause secondary traumatic injury such as rib fractures, urinary incontinence, pneumothorax, and facial petechiae. Often, such coughing fits are accompanied by cyanosis and may be followed by syncope, emesis, or apnea. The paroxysmal stage can last for weeks to months. Symptoms resolve during the convalescent stage, which lasts from 1 to 4 weeks. Pertussis can be prevented with immunization in the form of acellular pertussis, typically administered along with tetanus and diphtheria vaccines (DTaP).

From there, oxygenated blood is shunted from the right atrium to the left atrium, left ventricle {LV), and systemic circulation. The fetal lungs are filled with amniotic fluid while in utero, so the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is high. In patients with a VSD, increased PVR effectively prevents left-to-right shunting of blood from the LV to the right ventricle (RV).

Pertussis occurs because of an infection from Bordetella pertussis and classically presents in three stages. The catarrhal stage is first, which presents with fever, rhinorrhea, and a mild cough. This progresses to the paroxysmal stage after one to two weeks, in which patients experience violent bouts of extreme coughing, at times violent enough to cause secondary traumatic injury such as rib fractures, urinary incontinence, and pneumothorax. Often, such coughing fits are accompanied by cyanosis and may be followed by syncope, emesis, or apnea. The paroxysmal stage can last for weeks to months. Symptoms resolve during the convalescent stage, which lasts from one to four weeks. Pertussis toxin causes impaired recruitment and migration of phagocytes and production of inflammatory mediators. Patients often have significant lymphocytosis. Pertussis can be prevented with immunization in the form of acellular pertussis, typically administered along with tetanus and diphtheria vaccines.

The causes of Al, also called aortic regurgitation, include bicuspid aortic valve, aortic root dilation, and a history of rheumatic heart disease. It is also commonly associated with syndromes such as Marfan and Turner syndrome. Al results from an incompetent aortic valve that allows retrograde blood flow from the aortic root to the left ventricle (LV) during diastole. This results in an increased LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) as both blood from the aorta and the left atrium fill the LV. Increased volume stretches the compliant ventricle thereby increasing myocardial contractility, which is reflected as an increased stroke volume (SV) and a comparatively increased cardiac output.

Poor weight gain is a common diagnosis seen in primary care offices in approximately 5% of pediatric patients. Risk factors include prematurity, developmental delay, congenital abnormalities, or any condition resulting in inadequate intake, absorption, or metabolism of nutrients. Poverty, social isolation, certain nutritional beliefs and practices, poor parenting skills, substance abuse, violence, or other abuse also predispose to poor weight gain. The first step in evaluation of poor weight gain is to take a thorough history of dietary practices and review of systems. If no suspected underlying organic cause is found, management of mild malnutrition should involve parental education and dietary advice, changes to dietary practices, provision of home-based support and referral to community or governmental programs to increase access to food. Recommending a diet diary with calorie counts will both investigate whether inadequate caloric intake is the cause of the child's poor weight gain and also assist caregivers in creating a personalized feeding plan.",

During development, this plexus migrates cephalad to caudal and incomplete migration results in absence of the plexus in the distal portion of the gastrointestinal tract. This often leads to an inability to pass meconium within the first few days of life and, eventually, large bowel obstruction. An explosive expulsion of feces on rectal examination is a common clinical finding. Barium enema is used to evaluate for congenital megacolon in children. Congenital megacolon is associated with Down syndrome. Patients with Down syndrome are also at increased risk for dementia (Alzheimer type), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, cardiac septal defects, and duodenal atresia.",

These mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Spherocytosis results from progressive loss of the erythrocyte membrane over time and gives the erythrocytes a spherical shape; the surface area decreases but the volume of the cell remains unchanged. This impairs the erythrocyte's ability to confirm in small vessels of the microcirculation, especially within the spleen , where spherocytes accumulate. Patients often present with splenomegaly, hemolytic anemia, and pigmented gallstones.

Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive condition and is therefore more commonly seen in males, while most females are silent carriers. It is caused by an absence or deficiency of factor VIII, which is a component of the intrinsic clotting cascade. Factor VIII is required as a cofactor for the activation of factor X to factor Xa, which in turn converts prothrombin to thrombin to complete the process of clot formation. The PTT measures the activity of the intrinsic pathway and will be prolonged in cases of hemophilia A, while the PT measures the activity of factor VII (extrinsic pathway), which is normal in patients with this disease.",

Later in the disease course, atrophy of the lower extremity muscles and intrinsic hand muscle weakness and atrophy may occur.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a chronic pruritic inflammatory skin disease common in children that is suggested by pruritus and recurrent eczematous rashes. The rash is initially characterized by erythematous papules and vesicles with exudates and crusting and, with chronic scratching, becomes dry, scaly, and excoriated in a process called lichenification. Flexural dermatitis (eg, in the antecubital fossae) is a common pattern in children and adults with atopic dermatitis, but babies demonstrate a unique pattern, which primarily involves the bilateral cheeks and diaper area, as these areas are both frequently moist and subject to irritation. Treatment of atopic dermatitis begins with gentle skin care: minimizing long baths in warm water which causes drying of the skin, avoiding products with fragrance, and use of bland moisturizers such as petroleum jelly daily. In the case of an infant, keeping the cheeks dry and frequent diaper changes are also important. Flares of eczema are treated with mild- to moderate-potency topical corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone. In children, a moderate-potency topical corticosteroid should not be used consistently for over 2 to 3 weeks because of the potential of systemic absorption, particularly in the diaper area.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Precocious puberty is defined as the onset of pubertal development and secondary sexual characteristics prior to 8 years of age in girls and 9 years of age in boys. Precocious puberty can be central, which is caused by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This early activation can be idiopathic or caused by central nervous system abnormalities, such as a brain tumor. Precocious puberty can also be peripheral, which is caused by the release of excess sex hormones from the gonads or adrenal glands, or potentially the ectopic production of human chorionic gonadotropin from a germ-cell tumor. Initial evaluation involves the measurement of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone {LH), and estradiol or testosterone, which allows the provider to differentiate between central and peripheral causes of precocious puberty. Central precocious puberty is further evaluated with brain imaging, whereas peripheral precocious puberty is further evaluated with ultrasonography of the testes, ovaries, or adrenal glands. Treatment is dependent on the underlying pathology. As testicular size is based on the production of FSH, this patient more likely has a peripheral cause of precocious puberty with hyperandrogenism leading to inhibition of the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), FSH, and LH. Adrenal causes of precocious puberty include congenital adrenal hyperplasia and androgen-secreting tumors. Treatment for precocious puberty is dependent on the underlying pathology.",

Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a sexually transmitted bacterium that initially causes cervicitis, urethritis, or pharyngitis and may hematogenously disseminate to cause septic arthritis. Septic arthritis classically presents with a painful, erythematous, swollen joint along with systemic signs and symptoms of illness such as fever, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, and nausea. Gonococcal arthritis may present with monoarticular or asymmetric polyarticular disease and may feature adjacent tenosynovitis and dermatitis. The most common sites of gonococcal infection are the knee, ankle, wrist, and elbow, though the sternoclavicular joint may also be affected. In all causes of septic arthritis, serum laboratory values typically show leukocytosis along with increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein concentrations. Diagnosis requires arthrocentesis, which typically demonstrates purulent aspirate fluid with an increased concentration of neutrophil-predominant white blood cells.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Graves disease is an autoimmune hyperthyroid condition caused by thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies that activate the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor. Hyperstimulation of the TSH receptor leads to overproduction of thyroid hormone and a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland on physical examination, along with signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism including weight loss, insomnia, palpitations, heat intolerance, warm skin, tremor, diaphoresis, and pretibial myxedema. TSH-receptor-stimulating antibodies also stimulate orbital fibroblasts and lead to thyroid ophthalmopathy, which is characterized by the expansion of orbital fat and connective tissue with resultant exophthalmos, lid lag, and restrictive strabismus. Thyroid ophthalmopathy may lead to diplopia, corneal exposure, compressive optic neuropathy, and a cosmetic appearance that is distressing for patients. Thyroid laboratory studies typically demonstrate primary hyperthyroidism with increased thyroxine and triiodothyronine, and decreased TSH. Radioactive iodine uptake nuclear scintigraphy typically demonstrates diffuse, abnormally increased uptake of the thyroid gland without a discrete nodule. Graves disease is treated with antithyroid drugs such as methimazole and propylthiouracil, and radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid gland. Thyroid ophthalmopathy typically responds well to topical lubrication, although severe cases may require intravenous corticosteroids and a staged surgical approach.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Neonatal sepsis is categorized often on the basis of time from parturition, since the period of time in which symptoms begin may indicate which pathogen is likely involved, thereby guiding therapy. Early-onset neonatal sepsis (within 72 hours of birth) is marked by symptoms of lethargy, seizures, poor feeding, weak cry, and hypotonia. It presents with tachycardia, tachypnea, occasionally fever, and often with an examination that is nonfocal. If examination findings are present, they may reflect the source of infection or may reflect complications of sepsis such as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Early-onset neonatal sepsis generally occurs as a result of pathogens acquired from the mother, either through hematogenous or transplacental spread or, commonly, contact acquisition in the birth canal. The most common pathogens associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis include Streptococcus agalactiae (group B), Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Listeria monocytogenes. Syndromes of serious bacterial infection include bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia. Late-onset neonatal sepsis (presenting 72 hours or more after birth) more commonly occurs from environmental pathogens in addition to those acquired from the mother. Pneumonia is more common in early-onset sepsis, and presents with cough, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia, increased work of breathing, and rhonchi on auscultation. Workup for any suspected case of sepsis in a child younger than 30 days of age is broad, and should include a complete blood count, urinalysis, blood cultures, chest x-ray, and lumbar puncture at a minimum, since symptoms in this population are vague and nonspecific, limiting the utility of the history and physical examination to guide workup. X-rays in neonatal pneumonia disclose focal or diffuse airspace disease or may show diffuse interstitial infiltrates suggestive of respiratory distress syndrome.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is typically associated with infection from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H? caused by the production of Shiga toxin. It classically presents in children with bloody diarrhea accompanied by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. Other pathogenic precipitants include S. pneumoniae, Salmonella species, and Shigel/a species infections. This patient presents following several days of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, suggesting a bacterial or viral trigger. The abrupt change of pallor and lethargy, along with red urine and falling urine output suggests the presence of both anemia and renal failure. Physical examination may show petechiae, purpura, or ecchymosis, all of which are signs of thrombocytopenia. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates thrombocytopenia, increased creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentrations, and often multiple electrolyte derangements depending on the extent of volume depletion and acute renal failure. Treatment is supportive and may include plasma exchange; many cases self-resolve. Generally, platelet transfusion is contraindicated because of the risk for worsening the degree of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia since platelet administration has been postulated to worsen the degree of thrombosis. If fever and neurologic symptoms are concomitantly present along with the anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is diagnosed. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Goodpasture syndrome (Choice A) is a type II (complement-mediated cytotoxic) hypersensitivity reaction that involves autoimmune deposition of lgG against the basement membrane in the lung and kidney. Patients present with hemoptysis and nephritic syndrome, which may be rapidly progressive and cause renal failure or death if not treated. Henoch-Schonlein nephritis (Choice C) is a vasculitis that classically presents in a child with renal failure and palpable purpura on the lower extremities following an upper respiratory infection. Patients often complain of arthralgias and abdominal pain, and intussusception is a known complication. Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (Choice D) is a nephritic syndrome presenting with gross or microscopic hematuria, peripheral or periorbital edema, and hypertension in a child, typically two weeks after infection with group A ~-hemolytic streptococci. Laboratory evaluation may show low serum C3 concentrations and positive anti-streptolysin O and anti-DNase titers. Systemic vasculitis (Choice E) describes a broad class of diseases that encompass small, medium, and large arterial inflammation affecting various organ systems, commonly the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and lung. While vasculitides may present following illness, the classic triad of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure makes HUS a more likely diagnosis. r \" , r-- r ,",

There are several high-risk cardiac conditions that can present with syncope in pediatric patients, and these can be classified as structural defects, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery anomalies, or valvular aortic stenosis, or can be a result of electrical abnormalities, such as long QT syndrome or Brugada syndrome. Evaluation with ECG is mandatory in all patients with unexplained syncope. Of these, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is one of the more common causes of syncope. It is generally inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and may be the cause of death in this patient's cousin. Syncope occurs as a result of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction with a consequent decrease in cardiac output leading to decreased cerebral perfusion and syncope. Decreased perfusion of the coronary arteries can cause angina and increase the risk for ventricular arrhythmias, although this is not always seen. ECG classically demonstrates left ventricular hypertrophy with non-specific T wave abnormalities in the precordial leads. Deep, narrow, symmetric Q waves may also be seen in the lateral and inferior leads. Echocardiography should be subsequently performed to evaluate the underlying cardiac anatomy, which would allow for assessment of the degree of LVOT obstruction, if present.",

Adequate oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues occurs in several steps: oxygenation of the lung alveoli, binding of oxygen to hemoglobin in erythrocytes, and delivery of oxygenated erythrocytes to peripheral tissues with an adequate cardiac output. Peripheral oxygen delivery is mathematically defined by the product of the cardiac output and the arterial oxygen content. Arterial oxygen content is significantly lower in the setting of severe anemia, as in this patient, because there is a substantially lower hemoglobin content. As such, cardiac output must increase to accommodate a substantially lower arterial oxygen content if oxygen delivery to the peripheral tissues is to remain the same. This phenomenon accounts for the patient's active precordium and grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur. Additionally, this patient likely suffers from a component of sepsis given his persistent upper respiratory tract infection and fever, which would increase the patient's risk for concomitant septic shock.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Complement system immunodeficiency is the most likely diagnosis in this patient with meningococcemia. Late component complement deficiency (CS to C9) is a common finding in patients who have recurrent infections with Neisseria species, and increases susceptibility to this pathogen through failure to form the membrane attack complex (MAC). Complement activation can occur through the classical, lectin, or alternative pathways, with each pathway converging at the point where C3 is cleaved by C3 convertase, releasing C3a and C3b. Following this, C3b is incorporated into the C3 convertase complex, which subsequently acts on CS convertase to lower the Km (increase the affinity) of CS convertase for its substrate, CS. Cleavage of CS results in the formation of C5a, a potent chemoattractant, and C5b. C5b complexes with C6, C7, CB, and C9 (terminal complement factors) to form the MAC, which allows for the creation of a transmembrane pore that interferes with the integrity of the cellular membrane, leading to cell lysis. Deficiencies of terminal complement factors impair the formation of the MAC and preferentially predispose patients to infection with Neisseria species. While most patients experience mild infection with atypical serotypes, they can also develop fulminant meningococcemia from typical Neisseria serotypes, as in this patient. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, E, and F. AIDS (Choice A) can develop in pediatric patients who have acquired the infection vertically during the perinatal period from a mother with untreated HIV infection. Most patients present with evidence of recurrent pneumonia, infection with atypical organisms such as Mycobacterium avium, or with opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia. It commonly presents within months of birth but can also develop many years after birth. Child abuse (Choice B) should be suspected in cases where bruising is located in atypical locations such as the back or is with an atypical appearance, such as a linear mark on the upper arm. Purpura on the trunk and extremities is classic for meningococcemia and is far more likely in this patient with sepsis and a family history of meningococcemia. Congenital humoral system immunodeficiency (Choice D) is caused by numerous syndromes, including X-linked agammaglobulinemia, whereby B lymphocyte development is impaired by mutations in the BTK gene. Low or absent immunoglobulin secretion increases the risk for recurrent bacterial infections, but patients present within the first eighteen months of life. Increased susceptibility to Neisseria species, in particular, is not characteristic of this disease. Frequent exposure to multiple pathogens (Choice E) is incorrect. Healthy children are exposed to numerous pathogens on a daily basis and most do not develop invasive bacterial infections. While Neisseria meningitidis is associated with outbreaks in college dorms and military barracks, there is no such history in this case. Vitamin A deficiency (Choice F) is classically associated with xerophthalmia but does not cause the findings described in this patient.",

Myocardial infarction can present nonspecifically but classically occurs with shortness of breath, chest pain, light-headedness, nausea, vomiting, or altered mental status, and may be complicated by cardiogenic shock, seen as tachycardia, hypotension, and impaired end-organ perfusion (cool extremities, low urine output). In postoperative cases, especially with intubated patients, it may be difficult to assess the presence of myocardial infarction. Evaluation using ECG, serial troponin assays, and echocardiogram should be considered in such cases. Right-heart catheterization can be used to determine cardiac output and index, along with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which can distinguish right heart failure from left heart failure. An increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure indicates that filling pressures in the left heart are abnormal, which is consistent with myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Pneumothorax results from air entering the intrapleural space from either an external (e.g., stab wound) or internal (e.g., ruptured bleb or bronchus, bronchopleural fistula) source. As the air accumulates within the space, the lung parenchyma becomes compressed, resulting in reduced breath sounds, respiratory distress, and, in severe cases, tension on the mediastinal structures impeding venous return. In cases of acute trauma, evacuating the accumulated air permits expansion of the lung and elimination of tension on the great vessels; this is done through needle decompression in cases of tension pneumothorax, tube thoracostomy, or both. Once a tube thoracostomy is placed and healing of the inciting injury occurs, leakage of air into the pleural space should stop. If a persistent air leak is noted, the source of the leak should be investigated. A ruptured bronchus requires extended time to heal and is one source of a potential air leak. If the leak persists, surgical correction of the rupture may be required to prevent chronic pneumothorax from a resultant bronchopleural fistula. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, and D. Esophageal injury (Choice A) can result in pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax, and, if severe, bacterial mediastinitis can occur. While diminished breath sounds may occur in the setting of an esophageal injury, additional findings such as mediastinal crepitus, crunching on auscultation, and signs of sepsis would likely be present. Open pneumothorax (Choice B) would be detected on examination as a penetrating wound in continuity with the pleural space. Tension pneumothorax (Choice D) occurs when air accumulates within the pleural cavity to an extent that results in compression and shifting of the mediastinal structures. Such structural compromise results in impaired venous return leading to diminished cardiac output.

In some cases, the SDH may be large enough to compress the adjacent brain parenchyma; the displacement of the underlying cerebral hemisphere can result in neurologic deficits, altered mental status, seizures, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Alcohol use disorder is associated with cerebral atrophy, which causes traction on bridging cortical veins, such that minor trauma can result in shearing of the veins leading to hemorrhage. Untreated, the SDH presents the risk for continuing to grow in size, which can result in herniation of central nervous system structures if large enough.

Ventilation is a complex process driven by the somatic and autonomic nervous systems and requires an intact central nervous system without dysfunction of the brain stem, spinal cord, or efferent nerves (e.g., phrenic, intercostal). It also requires an unobstructed airway, unrestricted and semirigid chest wall, normal neuromuscular function, normal circulatory function , and normal pulmonary parenchymal and stromal function. Derangement within any part of this process can result in insufficient ventilation. Spinal anesthesia can reduce neuromuscular function distal to the level of the block. In turn, insufficient rate or depth of ventilation will result in retained carbon dioxide and development of acute respiratory acidosis. Acute respiratory acidosis typically demonstrates a decrease in pH with increased PCO on arterial blood gas. Hypoxia may be present. With cessation of neuromuscular blockade, respiratory mechanics should return to baseline, and result in 2 progressive resolution of the acid-base disturbance. In severe or complicated cases, ventilatory support may be required.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency are associated with chronic pancreatitis and result from repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis leading to the destruction of acinar and islet cells. The exocrine pancreas produces digestive enzymes, the absence of which leads to malnutrition (e.g., cachexia, muscle wasting), weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and frequent, loose, foul-smelling, sometimes oily stools (steatorrhea). The endocrine pancreas produces insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin. The loss of endogenous insulin leads to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, with symptoms including polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia. The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic insufficiency is through clinical history, imaging, and biopsy. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is treated with oral pancreatic enzyme replacement, and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus caused by the loss of pancreatic insulin requires insulin replacement. Any modifiable inciting causes of pancreatitis (e.g., gallstones, alcohol abuse, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia) should be mitigated to delay disease progression and preserve remaining native pancreatic function. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F.

They may exert mass effect on cranial nerves within their proximity or invade the nerves from which they arise, often the facial nerve, vestibulocochlear nerve, or adjacent nerves. Facial nerve involvement manifests as facial asymmetry caused by loss of skeletal muscle innervation, and occasionally presents with diminished taste perception involving the ipsilateral anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Vestibulocochlear nerve palsy can present with diminished hearing or tinnitus (cochlear branch) on the ipsilateral side, and vertigo or ataxia may occur (vestibular branch) because of impaired proprioception from loss of input from the ipsilateral vestibule.

The quantity of platelets and their qualitative function are both important in primary hemostasis. In cases of massive transfusion, imbalances in blood composition can occur if\nplasma or platelets are not replaced along with packed red blood cells. This imbalance in blood products can result in an acquired coagulopathy from dilution of platelets causing a relative thrombocytopenia. Symptoms include\nabnormal bleeding or bruising, often presenting with petechiae, ecchymoses, and mucosal bleeding (e.g., uterine bleeding, epistaxis), along with persistent 'oozing ' at puncture and operative sites, as is seen in this patient.\nSymptomatic thrombocytopenia secondary to imbalanced repletion should be treated with platelet transfusion.\nIncorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, E, G, and H.\nAnticardiolipin antibodies (Choice A) are commonly present in antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus, which generally result in a hypercoagulable state.\nAntithrombin Ill deficiency (Choice B) is a cause of hypercoagulability that can be hereditary or acquired as a result of nephrotic syndrome. It results in diminished effectiveness of heparin.\nFibrinogen abnormality (Choice C) suggests a mutated, hypofunctional, or deficient level of fibrinogen, which would result in a coagulopathy. The patient does not present with a typical history of disseminated intravascular\ncoagulopathy and with the history of imbalanced transfusions, thrombocytopenia is more likely.\nHemophilia (Choice D) occurs through genetic or acquired dysfunction of coagulation factors; this patient has no known genetic history of hypocoagulability and the temporal association of the patient's coagulopathy with\nimbalanced transfusions makes thrombocytopenia more likely.\nThrombasthenia (Choice E) refers to a qualitative platelet defect (e.g., Glanzmann Thrombasthenia because of a defect in surface protein Gpllb/llla), not a quantitative defect. This defect results in insufficient platelet-to-platelet\naggregation.

A hypermetabolic state ensues with signs and symptoms including agitation, diaphoresis, hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, and muscle rigidity. Complications include hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis. MH is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and can present similarly to neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome. Treatment requires discontinuation of the offending agent and rapid administration of dantrolene, which prevents calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

The reduced afferent blood flow can also result in progressive renal atrophy. Secondary hypertension should be considered in new-onset or treatment-resistant hypertension, or in patients with predisposing features such as known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (e.g., coronary artery disease). There are two main causes of renal artery stenosis: fibromuscular dysplasia and atherosclerosis. In younger patients, fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause, while older patients develop renal artery stenosis more commonly from atherosclerosis. Diagnosis is established with renal artery Doppler ultrasonography or magnetic resonance angiography, which can quantify the degree of renal artery stenosis and renal atrophy. Treatment involves angioplasty or stenting of the stenosed renal artery to improve flow.

Superficial burns (first-degree) do not involve layers deep to the epidermis and are characterized by erythema and pain, without blistering or loss of sensation. Partial thickness (second-degree) burns involve the epidermis and a portion of the dermis; they classically present with blistering, sloughing, severe pain, and erythema. Full thickness (third-degree) burns involve the epidermis and the full dermis, and are often accompanied by an insensate, charred, or leathery appearance. When calculating burned body surface area, only partial thickness and full thickness burns are counted. Superficial burns are not considered significant regarding fluid balance and resuscitation or the need for surgical intervention, as the stratum basalis and stem cells within hair follicles are preserved. In a superficial burn, the epidermis can regenerate from these unaffected sources of stem cells, whereas grafting may be required for deeper burns harming the cells responsible for tissue repair and regeneration.

C. difficile infections are associated with the presence of pseudomembranes that appear as patchy regions of white mucosa on colonoscopy. The severity of C. difficile colitis can vary, ranging from watery diarrhea without constitutional symptoms in mild cases to toxic megacolon, colonic ischemia, and severe sepsis in fulminant cases.

The two most common types of bladder rupture are extraperitoneal (-80%) and intraperitoneal (-15%). Extraperitoneal ruptures typically occur in the setting of penetrating trauma and pelvic fractures, while intraperitoneal ruptures are typically associated with direct blows to already distended urinary bladders. Ruptures present with severe lower abdominal and pelvic pain and tenderness with associated anuria; blood may be noted at the urethral meatus on examination. CT scan or fluoroscopic cystography is the diagnostic examination of choice, with contrast leaking into the retro/extraperitoneal space in an extraperitoneal rupture and into the peritoneal cavity in an intraperitoneal rupture. Management depends on the type of rupture. Extraperitoneal ruptures are typically treated with an indwelling Foley catheter to minimize urinary bladder intraluminal pressure and allow healing, while intraperitoneal ruptures typically require surgical repair.",

VSD results in a left-to-right shunt, which increases pulmonary blood flow. This leads to remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature and resultant smooth muscle hypertrophy. In turn, concentric narrowing of the pulmonary arterioles occurs, which results in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension. If severe and progressive enough, this can cause increased right ventricular pressures and associated myocardial hypertrophy, which subsequently results in reversal of the shunt, presenting with shortness of breath and cyanosis.

Perforation can result from traumatic injury, erosion of an ulcer or gastritis through the muscularis and adventitia, malignant invasion, or necrosis or infarction of a segment of bowel, and presents with symptoms of peritonitis. Peritonitis classically presents as acute, severe abdominal pain which may rapidly progress to sepsis and shock. Patients typically demonstrate unstable vital signs such as fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. Examination discloses a guarded and rigid abdomen, which is often \"board-like\". Due to translocation of intraluminal contents into the peritoneal space, fulminant sepsis can ensue. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (e.g. aspirin and ibuprofen) is a key risk factor for the development of peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, and should raise suspicion for a perforated viscus in the setting of an acutely peritonitic patient. These medications inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which plays a critical role in the maintenance of the gastric mucosal barrier by counterbalancing the erosive effects of stomach acid through the synthesis of bicarbonate and mucus. Pneumoperitoneum on the chest x-ray shows the presence of a perforated hollow viscus. Peritonitis requires emergent exploratory laparotomy to locate and control the source and washout peritoneal contents that may promote ongoing infection.",

Pulmonary artery catheterization indicates a decreased cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, with an increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Hypovolemic shock occurs secondary to significant reductions in a patient's intravascular volume most commonly related to hemorrhage, dehydration, or gastrointestinal losses, which results in decreased stroke volume and cardiac output. This, in turn, results in arteriolar vasoconstriction to increase SVR in an attempt to maintain mean arterial pressure.

ARDS is characterized by respiratory failure with bilateral diffuse interstitial and airspace opacities from underlying diffuse alveolar damage and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. ARDS is associated with aspiration, pneumonia, trauma, sepsis, and shock. Mechanical ventilation is often required in the management of ARDS because of hypoxia and hypoventilation. Further, polymicrobial flora on bronchial washings raises concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The most common organisms in the setting of VAP are gram-negative rods (e.g., Klebsiel/a species, Pseudomonas species), anaerobes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Given the virulence of the possible underlying infectious organisms, the development of a new cavitary lesion is likely secondary to the formation of a lung abscess.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cholangiocarcinoma, a malignancy of the bile ducts, characteristically presents late in its course with signs of biliary tree obstruction, including abdominal discomfort, weight loss, nausea, jaundice, and pruritus. Patients may report dark urine or light, pale stools. Many persons have no risk factors; however, those with a history of cirrhosis, sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis B or C, liver fluke infection, and ulcerative colitis may be at increased risk. Diagnosis occurs through imaging of the abdomen with CT scan or MRI, which may disclose a variety of findings from bile duct wall thickening, a focal mass, or only dilation of bile ducts proximal to the presumed lesion location. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) allows for the potential direct visualization of the lesion location, bile duct scrapings or biopsy for definitive diagnosis, and stenting of any associated occlusion. Laboratory analysis typically discloses obstructive (direct) hyperbilirubinemia and increased alkaline phosphatase activity. Treatment includes surgical resection and chemotherapy; however, the condition is often late-stage or terminal at the time of diagnosis. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Measurement of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration (Choice A) is sometimes increased in cholangiocarcinoma; however, it is nonspecific and is also increased in colorectal carcinoma along with other various malignancies. It may be followed during treatment to assess treatment response but does not have a specific role in diagnosis. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA scan) (Choice C) evaluates the patency of the hepatobiliary tree and gallbladder. It is useful in cases of suspected acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, or biliary obstruction with indeterminate ultrasonography findings. It does not permit tissue sampling such as biopsy or therapeutic interventions such as stenting. Liver biopsy (Choice D) is useful in the diagnosis of conditions such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, though cholangiocarcinoma is generally small and confined to the biliary tree. These features may result in false negative liver biopsy results and should prompt targeted sampling via ERCP. Exploratory laparotomy (Choice E) involves the surgical evaluation of the peritoneal cavity and is commonly employed in the diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma, bowel obstruction, peritonitis, and undifferentiated cases of an acute abdomen. It does not have an immediate role in the diagnosis or management of cholangiocarcinoma. r \" , r-- r ,",

Imaging may demonstrate osteophytosis, subchondral cystic or sclerotic changes, and space narrowing of joints. Arthrocentesis typically demonstrates leukocytes of less than 2,000/mm 3 with no additional abnormalities.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Leydig cell tumors arise from the interstitial cells of the testicle, specifically the Leydig cell, which physiologically produces sex hormones in response to stimulus from luteinizing hormone. Generally, Leydig cells secrete androgens in men; however, they can also secrete estrogens, especially in states of dysregulation (e.g., malignancy). In young boys, such upregulation of androgens presents with precocious puberty, while in women it presents with masculinization (e.g., amenorrhea, hirsutism, temporal balding, acne, deepening of the voice, clitoromegaly). Gynecomastia and a testicular nodule in a postpubertal, otherwise healthy male is suggestive of a functional estrogen secreting Leydig cell tumor. Diagnosis requires testicular ultrasonography, followed by orchiectomy and histologic evaluation.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Following thoracic or abdominal surgery, breathing often creates discomfort for patients by exacerbating postoperative pain. As a result, patients often splint their breathing, resulting in bradypnea and low tidal volume, which will decrease alveolar minute ventilation leading to the development of hypoxemia and acute respiratory acidosis. Underlying respiratory impairment (e.g., history of smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) may further exacerbate hypoventilation. Vital signs may disclose bradypnea and low arterial oxygen saturation. Physical examination will demonstrate diminished respiratory effort, often with reduced breath sounds at the lung bases because of atelectasis and inadequate diaphragmatic excursion. Arterial blood gas analysis may disclose an acidic pH with increases in both Pco and HCO along with low arterial oxygen -, 2 3 tension. Hypoxemia will improve with the administration of supplemental oxygen, whereas hypercapnia will persist until the resolution of ventilatory insufficiency. Pain control, incentive spirometry, and respiratory therapy with lung expansion maneuvers are key initial steps in management.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Congenital heart disease is often subdivided into cyanotic and noncyanotic types depending on the direction of blood shunting. Structural heart defects that result in flow of deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary to systemic circulations (a right-to-left shunt) classically present with cyanosis, respiratory distress, hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension generally within 1 to 7 days after birth. Common culprit lesions include truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great vessels, tricuspid atresia, tetralogy of Fallo!, and total anomalous pulmonary venous return. These lesions require the concomitant presence of a left-to-right shunt (patent ductus arteriosus) to allow for a degree of blood oxygenation. Without a left-to-right shunt, a complete absence of oxygenation can occur because of the separated circulatory systems, which is incompatible with life. In cases of a suspected congenital cyanotic heart defect, intravenous prostaglandin should be started, which maintains a patent ductus arteriosus. Administration of indomethacin or similar nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medications should be avoided, as these will result in closure of the ductus arteriosus. Echocardiography is required to determine the structural defects to confirm the right-to-left shunt and to assist in operative planning.",

It is occasionally preceded by symptoms of biliary colic. It is more commonly seen in women with obesity in their 40s to 50s, especially those having a history of multi parity. Risk factors include gallstones, biliary sludge, or conditions that slow or delay gastric emptying or reduce contractility of the gallbladder such as pregnancy or total parenteral nutrition. Diagnosis is through clinical history, physical examination, and ultrasonography, which may disclose pericholecystic fluid, a dilated gallbladder, gallbladder wall thickening and hyperemia, the presence of gallstones, and a sonographic Murphy sign (pain with compression directly over the gallbladder). Treatment involves surgical resection of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy). lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, E, and F.

Presenting features are often nonspecific and may include weight loss, abdominal discomfort or distention, ascites, and gastrointestinal symptoms including early satiety, bloating, nausea, cramping, and bowel obstruction. Bowel obstruction can occur because of locally invasive disease or because of peritoneal carcinomatosis, which is often a common presenting diagnosis. Spread of the malignancy throughout the peritoneum results in bowel and omental implants, which on gross surgical examination is described as \"caking.\" The resultant mechanical distortion, tethering, and compression of bowel leads to obstruction in a similar mechanism to postoperative adhesions and strictures. Any incidental ovarian enlargement or cyst in a woman over age 50 years should be investigated for malignancy with imaging and potentially biopsy. Ovarian cancer is also potentially hereditary, with an increased frequency of cases seen in women with mutations in BRCA 1/2 and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.

To prevent further progression of the dissection flap, controlling the patient's heart rate and blood pressure is the first priority. An intravenous ~-adrenergic blocking agent should be used with a goal of decreasing the heart rate to approximately 60/min and the blood pressure to less than 100 to 120 mm Hg systolic and 60 to 80 mm Hg diastolic. Decreasing the heart rate helps prevent the advancement of the dissection flap and resultant occlusion of branch vessels by limiting the pulse pressure differential.

Classically, these tumors occur at the cerebellopontine angle of the brain stem and are associated with neurofibromatosis. They may exert mass effect on cranial nerves within their proximity or invade the nerves from which they arise, often the facial nerve, vestibulocochlear nerve, or adjacent nerves. Facial nerve involvement manifests as facial asymmetry because of loss of skeletal muscle innervation and occasionally presents with diminished taste perception involving the ipsilateral anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Vestibulocochlear nerve palsy can present with diminished hearing or tinnitus (cochlear branch) on the ipsilateral side, and vertigo or ataxia may occur (vestibular branch) because of impaired proprioception from loss of input from the ipsilateral vestibule. In cases of larger masses, disruption of brain stem tracts and increased intracranial pressure can result.",

As the air accumulates within the space, the lung parenchyma becomes compressed, resulting in respiratory distress, reduced breath sounds, hyperresonance to percussion, and in severe cases, tension on the mediastinal structures impeding venous return resulting in hypotension. A spontaneous primary pneumothorax can occur in a tall, thin, young person because of the rupture of a pulmonary bleb, classically in a young athlete and often during physical exertion. Small pneumothoraces can be managed with serial examinations and repeat chest x-rays to confirm resolution. When the lesion is larger than 20 to 30% of the hemithoracic volume, a chest tube should be placed to evacuate the pneumothorax and reinflate the lung to prevent the development of a persistent or permanent pneumothorax. Tension pneumothorax should be immediately decompressed with emergent needle thoracostomy to prevent hemodynamic collapse.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Osteoporosis occurs because of the loss of bone mineral density. The condition results from the interplay of three possible mechanisms: failure to achieve peak bone density, increased bone resorption, and decreased new bone formation. The condition is often asymptomatic until a traumatic injury results in a fracture, most commonly involving the hip, distal radius, or vertebrae. Classically, serum calcium, vitamin D, and magnesium concentrations are within the reference ranges; however, calcium handling in the bloodstream is key in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Hypocalcemia and hypovitaminosis D both lead to increased concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which results in increased osteoclast activity and bone resorption. Low concentrations of vitamin D are also associated with increased concentrations of PTH even when serum calcium is within the reference range. The diagnosis of osteoporosis is made based on DEXA scan once the bone density falls below 2.5 standard deviations of the mean for a young adult. Treatment includes correcting any modifiable risk factors, supplementing calcium and vitamin D, weight-bearing exercise therapy, and the use of osteoclast inhibitors (e.g., bisphosphonates).",

Many people will develop some degree of valve stenosis because of chronic inflammation with resultant calcification and fibrosis over time, with the aortic valve most commonly affected. Structural abnormalities of the valve, such as a bicuspid aortic valve, alter the biomechanics of valve opening and closing, which increases the likelihood of earlier calcification and resultant stenosis because of increased mechanical trauma. Congenital bicuspid aortic valve classically presents with early signs and symptoms of aortic stenosis and left-sided diastolic heart failure. Patients may report fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, diminished exercise tolerance, or syncope with exertion. Examination findings include a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border, and pulsus parvus et tardus (weak and delayed) may be noted on examination of peripheral pulses. Because of the chronic increased afterload from a fixed obstruction by the valve, left ventricular hypertrophy and resultant diastolic dysfunction can occur.

Leg pain that occurs following exertion and improves with rest is known as claudication and indicates the presence of peripheral vascular disease.

As demand falls during rest, the pain typically improves. Peripheral vascular disease is common among older men who smoke cigarettes and have a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia. Active exercise improves collateral vascularization, which allows for improved arterial oxygenated blood flow to the skeletal musculature and is the best initial step in treatment along with the mitigation of risk factors.

The loss of acinar and islet parenchyma can be further exacerbated if a distal pancreatectomy is performed to control symptoms or manage complications of chronic pancreatitis. The exocrine pancreas produces digestive enzymes, the absence of which leads to malnutrition (e.g., cachexia, muscle wasting), weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and frequent, loose, foul-smelling, sometimes oily stools (steatorrhea). The diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency is through clinical history, imaging, and biopsy. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is treated with oral pancreatic enzyme replacement such as pancrelipase. Endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, if present, typically results in diabetes mellitus, which requires insulin replacement therapy. Any modifiable inciting causes of pancreatitis (e.g., gallstones, alcohol use disorder, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia) should be mitigated to delay disease progression and preserve remaining native pancreatic function.",

Small volume, simple fluid aspiration may be resorbed by the lung without any consequence of infection, irritation, or compromised gas exchange. In other cases, large volume aspiration may sufficiently impair gas exchange resulting in refractory hypoxia. The aspiration of acidic stomach contents may cause aspiration pneumonitis, whereas the aspiration of gastrointestinal flora and additional bacteria can cause aspiration pneumonia. The volume of aspirate is the strongest predictor of complications from aspiration, especially in the case of pneumonia, as the bacterial inoculum may overwhelm the native ability of the pulmonary alveolar defenses (macrophages, cilia, mucus) to prevent colonization, replication, and infection. Aspiration pneumonia classically presents with cough productive of foul-smelling sputum, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, and rhonchi on examination. Imaging classically shows an infiltrate in the most dependent segments of lung at the time of aspiration (e.g., in the superior segment of the inferior lobe when supine or lower lobes when erect), and treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics with sufficient coverage of oral flora, gram-negative rods, and anaerobes.",

Dermatologic manifestations of this phenomenon are localized petechiae, livedo reticularis, and blue toe syndrome. Risk factors for cholesterol embolization syndrome include trauma and interventional procedures that increase the risk for damage and dislodgement of atherosclerotic plaques, such as cardiac catheterization (e.g., damage to atherosclerotic plaques of the thoracic and abdominal aorta via a femoral artery approach).

The most common intracranial tumor is a metastatic lesion from an extracranial primary malignancy. The cerebellum is a common location for metastases, along with the gray-white matter junction of the supratentorial brain. Cerebellar metastases typically present as a headache and symptoms of cerebellar dysfunction, such as gait disturbance, limb discoordination, and dizziness. Metastases to the brain are associated with significant vasogenic edema. This edema can lead to abnormal enlargement of the cerebellum, which can impress upon the fourth ventricle and foramina of Magendie and Luschka. This can result in the development of obstructive hydrocephalus and increased ICP. Increased ICP presents as nonspecific symptoms of altered mental status, stupor, vomiting, seizures, and blurry vison. Papilledema refers to optic disc swelling seen on funduscopic examination of the eyes and is secondary to increased intracranial pressure. The administration of intravenous corticosteroids assists in reducing metastasis-associated vasogenic edema, limiting its mass effect and risk for the development of obstructive hydrocephalus and increased ICP.",

Acute hypercalcemia can present as a broad spectrum of symptoms and can be life threatening because of its effect on neuronal conduction, the cardiac action potential, kidney function, and volume status. It commonly presents as constipation, lethargy, weakness, and altered mental status. It can result in a short QT interval and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, leading to significant dehydration. A potential cause of severe hypercalcemic crisis is malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, which can be secondary to the humoral secretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma of the lung) or from direct invasion and lytic lesions of the bone from osseous metastases (e.g., breast cancer). Treatment emphasizes preventing end-stage kidney disease, promoting the renal excretion of calcium, reducing intestinal absorption of calcium, inhibiting bony destruction, and, if necessary, renal replacement therapy with dialysis. Treatment therefore begins with the infusion of normal saline to restore intravascular volume and dilute serum calcium, followed by the administration of osteoclast inhibitors such as bisphosphonates, and possibly calcitonin if further medications are required to decrease calcium concentrations.",

HIT typically occurs between 5 and 10 days after the initiation of heparin therapy. HIT results from the development of lgG antibodies against the complex of heparin and platelet factor 4. The antibody-heparin-platelet complex leads to the activation of platelets, which can cause thrombosis and consumption of platelets. This abnormal activation and consumption results in progressively decreasing platelet counts, which typically nadir at >50% of their initial level. Treatment requires cessation of all heparin-related products (e.g., unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin).

The main adverse effects of diphenhydramine are a result of its central nervous system H rreceptor blockade, anticholinergic, and anti-a-adrenergic effects. These lead to a constellation of symptoms such as dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, hallucinations, delirium, ataxia, flushed skin, visual disturbances (cycloplegia), and sedation. Muscarinic type 3 receptors stimulate the contraction of smooth muscle in the urinary bladder wall. The anticholinergic adverse effects of diphenhydramine antagonize this action, resulting in impaired urinary bladder contractility, which subsequently leads to urinary retention. In addition to catheterization to prevent damage to the bladder and kidneys, treatment requires cessation of the offending agent and substitution with a second-generation H rreceptor blocking agent such as loratadine, which does not produce anticholinergic adverse effects.",

Transfusion reactions can range from mild (e.g., itching, fever, mild rash) to severe (e.g., hemolysis, anaphylaxis). Most reactions are mild and may not necessitate the cessation of the transfusion. An acute febrile transfusion reaction (febrile, non hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR)) occurs because of the presence of preformed antibodies to donor leukocyte antigens and occasionally from cytokines in the plasma component of the transfused sample. FNHTR ranges from mild (mild fever, minimal additional symptoms) to severe (high fevers, rigors, myalgias, nausea). Treatment consists of pausing the transfusion to rule out ABO incompatibility through performing a direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test. The Coombs test entails testing for the presence of antibodies on the recipient's red blood cells (ABO incompatibility), and if positive, would confirm an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR) instead of an FNHTR.

Normal urine output ranges between 0.5 and 2 cc/kg/hr. Prerenal azotemia refers to an acute kidney injury secondary to insufficient renal blood flow in states of hypoperfusion, which results in a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This can occur in the setting of hypovolemia and hypotension, including transient intraoperative hypotension. In response to the decreased renal blood flow, renin and angiotensin are upregulated, which stimulates increased absorption of sodium in the proximal convoluted tubule. The decreased GFR results in decreased tubular flow rate, which consequently leads to increased urea nitrogen reabsorption and reduced urine volume because of the increased resorption of solute and water. Treatment of prerenal azotemia requires treatment of the underlying cause of reduced renal blood flow, often requiring the administration of resuscitative intravenous fluids. If untreated, this can progress to worsening acute kidney injury and possible intrinsic end-stage kidney disease.",

The chronic use of exogenous corticosteroids results in decreased production of adrenocorticotropic hormone from the pituitary gland. This leads to atrophy of bilateral adrenal glands, and resultant diminished native production of corticosteroids. In the event of a physiologic stressor (e.g., surgery, trauma, infection), the body's physiologic demand for corticosteroids increases but is not met because of the patient's chronic adrenal atrophy. This results in the onset of acute relative adrenal insufficiency, which presents as hypoglycemia, altered mental status, hyponatremia, tachycardia, and abnormal vasodilation, including fluid- and pressor-refractory hypotension. While difficult to diagnose because of its nonspecific presentation, acute adrenal crisis should be considered in the differential of any patient presenting with circulatory collapse.

Fibromuscular dysplasia is a noninflammatory and nonatherosclerotic angiopathy of medium-sized arteries (e.g., renal, carotid) that results in multifocal fibrous and muscular thickening of the arterial wall, which can lead to a bead-like appearance and resultant stenosis. Renal artery stenosis is a cause of secondary hypertension because of abnormal stimulation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus from low afferent blood flow leading to excessive production of renin and angiotensin. The reduced afferent blood flow can result in progressive renal atrophy. Secondary hypertension should be considered in new-onset or treatment-resistant hypertension, or in younger, otherwise healthy patients. There are two main causes of renal artery stenosis: fibromuscular dysplasia and atherosclerosis. In younger patients, fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause, while older patients develop renal artery stenosis more commonly from atherosclerosis. Diagnosis is established with renal artery Doppler ultrasonography or magnetic resonance angiography, which are able to quantify the degree of renal artery stenosis and renal atrophy. Treatment involves angioplasty or stenting of the stenosed renal artery to improve flow. ACE inhibitors can also be considered for unilateral stenosis but can lead to acute renal failure in the setting of significant bilateral renal artery stenosis.",

This results in vertebrobasilar insufficiency, which can manifest as dizziness, vertigo, imbalance, light-headedness, and hearing disturbances. Most patients demonstrate differential blood pressures between the affected and unaffected upper extremities, with a greater than 15-mm Hg differential between the two.

Necrotizing fasciitis refers to infection spreading along a deep fascial plane, most commonly from mixed flora (anaerobic and aerobic bacteria), although it can occur secondary to a single organism. It typically presents as acute onset of pain out of proportion to examination findings, erythema, and paresthesia which progresses to anesthesia at a site of prior trauma or surgery. Risk factors include the severity of inoculation and underlying chronic systemic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, liver failure, or kidney failure. As the bacterial infection spreads along the deep fascial planes, bullae with or without crepitus may develop. The extent of infection is often difficult to assess by examination alone.

Symptoms include chronic abdominal pain, weight loss, bloody diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and tenesmus. Imaging typically demonstrates loss of haustral markings. Diagnosis of ulcerative colitis is by colonoscopy and biopsy, which demonstrates characteristic crypt abscesses. Potential complications of ulcerative colitis are fulminant colitis, toxic megacolon, and perforation. As well, because of the chronic inflammation of the colon, patients are at a substantially increased risk for developing colorectal carcinoma. Screening colonoscopy is indicated every 1 to 2 years starting 8 to 10 years after diagnosis.

On physical examination, they typically present as a shortened, adducted, and internally rotated lower extremity that is flexed at the hip. There is risk for injury to the sciatic nerve, and of avascular necrosis of the femoral head if there is compromise of the proximal femoral vasculature. Diagnosis is based on the presenting traumatic history, physical examination findings, and x-ray or CT scan. Treatment requires closed reduction followed by abduction bracing of the hip. Reduction should not be delayed for imaging, as a shorter time to reduction is associated with fewer complications and improved outcomes.",

It typically presents as fever, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and tenderness to palpation, often in a patient with a history of gallstones. It is occasionally preceded by symptoms of biliary colic from cholelithiasis. Characteristic ultrasonography findings of acute cholecystitis include gallbladder wall thickening and hyperemia, pericholecystic fluid, presence of gallstones, and a sonographic Murphy sign. If ultrasonography findings are equivocal, a HIDA scan can be performed; this is a nuclear medicine scan that evaluates for patency of the cystic duct and biliary tree.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Laparoscopy is indicated for the evaluation of acute lower abdominal or pelvic pain associated with an ovarian mass. The differential diagnosis for a tender adnexal mass resulting in acute pain includes ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, tuba-ovarian abscess, appendicitis, and a ruptured ovarian cyst. Given that the mass is located within the ovary, is exquisitely tender, and the pregnancy test is negative, the potential for ovarian torsion is high. Ovarian torsion occurs secondary to hypermobility of the ovary or the presence of a large adnexal mass. Patients typically present with acute lower abdominal and pelvic pain, which may be lateralized to the side of torsion, along with nausea and vomiting. Evaluation of ovarian torsion includes visualization with ultrasonography, which can assess the size, features, underlying mass, and blood flow of the ovary. Treatment includes supportive therapy, pain management, and definitive intervention with laparoscopy to evaluate the adnexa, attempt detorsion of the ovary, and if necessary, remove a nonviable ovary or any suspicious, predisposing ovarian masses.",
