She is of northern European\ndescent and has lived in the southern United States for her entire life. Vital signs are within normal limits. Fundusco pic examination shows mild pallor of the\nleft optic disc. Visual acuity is 20/80 on the left and 20/25 on the right. Neurologic examination shows mild right hemiparesis and bilateral ataxia on\nfinger-nose and heel-shin testing. The remainder of the examination shows no abnorma lities. An MRI of the brain shows multiple areas of increased T2 signal\nin the periventricu lar white matter and the white matter of the cerebellum.
