Hypertensive emergency is defined as a blood pressure greater than 180/120 mm Hg with evidence of end-organ damage (e g, pulmonary edema and acute heart failure). The patient's severe hypertension causes an acute increase in afterload that the heart is unable to overcome, and impaired forward flow of blood leads to congestion and increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary vascular system and the systemic venous system. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema presents in patients with shortness of breath, tachypnea, hypoxia, and audible rales on examination. Intravenous antihypertensive medications should be used for the treatment of hypertensive emergency to appropriate ly decrease blood pressure and limit progression of end-organ damage. In acute heart failure and pulmonary edema, the blood pressure should be rapidly decreased using nitroglycerin, a potent vasodilator, to lower mean arterial pressure by decreasing vascular resistance. Nitroglycerin, a venodilator, can also be used to shift fluid into capacitance vessels and lower preload. Positive pressure ventilation can also decrease alveolar and interstitial edema and drive fluid back into circulation.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia and has an increased prevalence in patients with a history of immunocompromise, such as HIV, multiple myeloma, or following solid organ transplant. Typical signs and symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia include fever, chills, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, dyspnea, productive cough, rales, decreased breath sounds, increased tactile fremitus, and pleuritic chest pain. Plain film x-ray commonly discloses a lobar pneumonia or, less commonly, bronchopneumonia. The diagnosis may be supported by sputum culture with the presence of gram-positive diplococci in chains. Patients with evidence of unstable vital signs should undergo blood culture to evaluate for possible bacteremia. Therapy includes support of vitals as well as empiric antibiotic therapy either with a third-generation cephalosporin and macrolide or with fluoroquinolones. While pneumococcal pneumonia remains the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia, prophylaxis with pneumococcal vaccines has led to a decline in its incidence over recent decades.",

        "A": "Adenovirus is a cause of viral pneumonia and may lead to severe infections in patients who are immunocomprom ised. However, this patient's fever and the presence of gram-positive, diplococci on sputum culture are suggestive of pneumococcal pneumonia.",
        "B": "Coxsackievirus is an RNA enterovirus that is transmitted via oral secretions or feces. Coxsackievirus group A causes hand, foot, and mouth disease and herpangina. Coxsackievirus group B may cause myocarditis and pericarditis. Haemophi/us influenza (Choice C) is an encapsulated gram-negative bacillus that is a common cause of pneumonia in adults. However, it is less common in comparison to S. pneumoniae (a gram-positive coccus). Klebsiel/a pneumoniae (Choice D) is a gram-negative bacillus that classically causes hospital-acquired pneumonia. It is less frequently a cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Legionel/a pneumophi/a (Choice E) is a gram-negat ive bacillus that is transmitted through aerosols from water sources and causes atypical pneumonia that appears as diffuse, patchy alveolar and interstitial opacities or as a lobar consolidation. It can be associated with hyponatremia. Moraxel/a catarrha/is (Choice F) is a gram-negative diplococcus that is a rare cause of pneumonia in immunocomprom ised adults. It typically causes bacterial rhinosinusitis and has been implicated in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults. Pneumocystis jirovecii (Choice H) is a yeast-like fungus which causes pneumocys tis pneumonia in patients who are immunocomprom ised. Chest imaging typically shows diffuse, bilateral perihilar infiltrates. Pneumocyst is pneumonia is less common than pneumococcal pneumonia, including among immunocompromised patients. Staphylococca l (Choice I) pneumonia typically presents as a lobar pneumonia that occurs in elderly adults following a preceding viral infection."

ECG evidence of hyperkalemia includes flattening of the P-waves, lengthening of the PR interval, widening of the ORS complex, and the presence of tall, peaked T-waves. Acute management in order of priority involves stabilization of the myocardium with calcium gluconate or calcium chloride, shifting serum potassium into the intracellular compartment (using insulin and dextrose, sodium bicarbonate, or ~ adrenergic agonists), and removal of potassium from the body (using diuretics, oral potassium binders, or 7 hemodialysis). After the patient is stabilized, evaluation should be directed toward identifying the cause of the hyperkalemia. In this patient with a recent hospitalization for pneumonia, dementia, underlying chronic kidney injury, loop diuretic use, and recent history of emesis, the most likely explanation is acute on chronic renal failure caused by hypovolemia exacerbated by diuretic use. steps include laboratory studies, urinalysis, imaging, and admission for further management.",

CO has a significantly higher affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen and binds to available hemoglobin. On binding, CO displaces oxygen from heme, limiting total carrying capacity, and results in maintenance of hemoglobin in the relaxed form, with loss of cooperative binding. This results in systemic hypoxemia and tissue hypoxia. Risk factors include prolonged exposure to motor vehicle exhaust (as in operating an outboard motor for an extended period of time); exposure to byproducts of burning charcoal, gas, or petroleum (especially in poorly ventilated areas); or exposure to paint thinners that contain methylene chloride (which is metabolized to CO). Symptoms include headache, light-headedness, nausea, and altered mental status. Patients typically have a paradoxically normal peripheral oxygen saturation and may display tachycardia, tachypnea, and cherry-red skin on physical examination in the late stages of CO poisoning. Acute management involves removing the patient from the exposure and treatment with 100% supplemental oxygen to displace CO from hemoglobin. Severe cases and high-risk patients demonstrating any degree of neurologic deficit or significant end-organ dysfunction should be treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

Administration of ipecac (Choice A) is not recommended for treatment of CO poisoning. While historically ipecac was used to treat numerous types of oral toxin ingestions, it is no longer widely recommended because of limited established benefit and potential risk of harm. Similarly, gastric lavage (Choice C) was a common gastric decontamination procedure for oral toxic ingestions that is no longer widely recommended. Administration of 0.9% saline and vitamin B (thiamine) (Choice B) would be an appropriate treatment for acute alcohol toxicity or 1 withdrawal complicated by volume depletion, with thiamine given to prevent or treat Wernicke encephalopathy.

Naloxone therapy (Choice F) generally provides potential strong benefit without risk of harm in treating encephalopathy caused by suspected opioid overdose.

Unexpected submersion in water leads to reflexive breath holding followed by air hunger and an eventual reflexive inspiratory effort. This leads to hypoxia through either aspiration of water or laryngospasm when water contacts the vocal cords. Prolonged hypoxemia leads to end-organ dysfunction including acidosis, hypoxic brain injury, and cardiac arrhythmias. Exposure of the alveoli to water can lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which appears on chest imaging as noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. ARDS can develop immediate ly after injury or slowly over many hours and can be rapidly fatal. In general, all nonfatal drowning victims with any degree of hypoxia, respiratory distress, or infiltrates on imaging should be hospitalized to monitor for the evidence of the development of ARDS and complications of drowning.",

Admission to the hospital for observation is the most appropriate management for this young girl who recently suffered a nonfatal drowning incident. Unexpected submersion in water leads to reflexive breath holding followed by air hunger and an eventual reflexive inspiratory effort. This leads to hypoxia through either aspiration of water or laryngospasm when water contacts the vocal cords. Prolonged hypoxemia leads to end-organ dysfunction including acidosis, hypoxic brain injury, and cardiac arrhythmias. Exposure of the alveoli to water can lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which appears on chest imaging as noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. ARDS can develop immediately after injury or slowly over many hours and can be rapidly fatal. In general, all nonfatal drowning victims with any degree of hypoxia, respiratory distress, or infiltrates on imaging should be hospitalized to monitor for the evidence of the development of ARDS and complications of drowning. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Antibiotic therapy (Choice B) is not indicated in this patient. Antibiotics are reserved for patients with presumed or proven bacterial infections, but drowning does not necessarily predispose to the development of bacterial infection. Corticosteroid therapy (Choice C) is not useful in the management of drowning victims.

Diuretic therapy (Choice D) is used to treat patients with hypervolemia that develops as a result of renal disease or decompensated heart failure, but diuretics are not useful in the treatment of drowning victims. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (Choice E) can be a useful adjunct in patients with both cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, but this patient is maintaining reasonable oxygenation, so this intervention would be premature."

If gallstones become lodged in the distal aspect of the CBD, obstruction of pancreatic flow can lead to release and activation of pancreatic enzymes within the pancreas, which causes substantial inflammation and pain. Additiona lly, as the flow of bile toward the duodenum is obstructed, patients can develop hyperbilirubinemia and increased liver enzymes. This can predispose to cholangitis, which is an ascending bacterial infection of the biliary tree. Treatment for gallstone pancreatitis is either cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography or, in most cases, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to retrieve the obstructing gallstone. While awaiting procedural intervention, patients should be treated with intravenous fluids, narcotic pain medications, and antibiotics if there is suspicion for biliary tree infection.",

        "A": "induced pancreatitis is a common cause of pancreatitis, but this patient with a history of hyperlipidemia, increased bilirubin, and increased liver-associated enzymes is more likely to have gallstone pancreatitis. Increased direct bilirubin would not be classic if alcohol was the primary cause.",

It does not result in increased liver-associated enzymes. Drug-induced hepatic dysfunction (Choice D) can either be idiosyncratic or dose-dependent, as in the case of acetaminophen overdose. It may present with increased concentrations of ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin, but it requires a compatible history of drug exposure, which is absent in this case. Duodenal ulceration (Choice E) may present with epigastric pain and may cause gastrointestinal bleeding with subsequent melena, but it does not cause an increase in liver enzymes."

Diabetic ketoacidosis (OKA) presents with fatigue, polyuria, polydipsia, shortness of breath or tachypnea, and diffuse abdominal discomfort, most commonly in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. It is caused by the accumulation of serum ketones such as p hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone in the setting of insulin deficiency.

Potassium concentration may be decreased (Choice C), normal, or increased (Choice F) on presentation. Patients with OKA often have a total body deficit of potassium as a result of osmotic diuresis in the setting of hyperglycemia. However, the serum concentration may remain normal or even high since the lack of insulin and metabolic acidosis cause potassium to move out of the cells and into the serum. Increased bicarbonate (Choice D) is seen in metabolic alkalosis, which can occur with volume depletion secondary to persistent nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, OKA causes an increase in the amount of acid in the blood, which is buffered by bicarbonate. Subsequent metabolic acidosis occurs with decreased bicarbonate."

Hypertensive emergency is defined as a blood pressure greater than 180/120 mm Hg with evidence of end-organ damage (e g, pulmonary edema and acute heart failure). The patient's severe hypertension causes an acute increase in afterload that the heart is unable to overcome, and impaired forward flow of blood leads to congestion and increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary vascular system and the systemic venous system. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema presents in patients with shortness of breath, tachypnea, hypoxia, and audible rales on examination. Intravenous antihypertensive medications should be used for the treatment of hypertensive emergency to appropriate ly decrease blood pressure and limit progression of end-organ damage. In acute heart failure and pulmonary edema, the blood pressure should be rapidly decreased using nitroglycerin, a potent vasodilator, to lower mean arterial pressure by decreasing vascular resistance.

While age over 45 years is associated with suicide attempts, this patient's age of 29 years is not (Choice A). Family and spousal support, which this patient has, is a strongly protective factor for suicide. Thus, family support (Choice C) is not a risk factor for this patient attempting suicide.

Pediatric patients typically present with lethargy. Signs of volume depletion include tachycardia, hypotension, a sunken anterior fontane lle, and dry mucous membranes.

CT scan of the abdomen is most likely to confirm the ureterolithiasis in this patient with right flank pain and hematuria. Risk factors for the development of nephrolithiasis include diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, male sex, and prior gastric bypass. Calcium containing stones, including calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate, are the most common varieties, although kidney stones may also be composed of cystine, struvite, and uric acid. The typical presentation of kidney stones that have become lodged in the ureter (ureterolithiasis) includes severe, intermittent, sharp flank pain with either gross or microscopic hematuria, leukocytosis, and occasionally evidence of a concomitant urinary tract infection. While abdominal, plain x-rays were traditionally used for diagnosis, urate stones are radiolucent, and given the availability and sensitivity of advanced imaging, a noncontrast CT scan of the abdomen is now the preferred imaging modality for definitive diagnosis. Acute management depends on the size and location of the stone, in addition to complicating factors such as abnormal anatomy or the concurrent presence of a urinary tract infection. Staghorn calculi, which occur commonly in the setting of infection with urease-producing bacteria, often must be surgically removed. Additionally, stones larger than 6 mm often require intervention because they are unlikely to pass on their own. For smaller stones in clinically stable patients, treatment is hydration and pain control. Medications such as tamsulosin may be used to augment stone passage. At times, urine should be strained to assess the passage of the stone, though data and practice patterns on this are mixed.",

Measurement of serum uric acid concentration (Choice D) is not necessary in this patient because he does not have evidence of a gout flare. While some kidney stones are composed of uric acid, serum uric acid measurement does not reliably predict the composition of any kidney stones. Urine culture (Choice E) should be performed in patients who are suspected to have a urinary tract infection in addition to ureterolithiasis. Laboratory findings consistent with diagnosis of a urinary tract infection include pyuria, positive nitrites, or positive leukocyte esterase on urinalysis."

Complete blood count (Choice A) can be done as part of routine blood work prior to possible surgery or hospitalization, but it would not change or assist in the management. Exploratory laparotomy (Choice B) can be done for obstruction that does not autoreduce with bowel rest and decompression but would not be appropriate prior to insertion of a nasogastric tube for management. Surgery is also indicated in cases of perforation or necrosis, but this patient does not show any signs of peritonitis or guarding suggestive of these complications. Intravenous antibiotic therapy (Choice D) would be indicated in cases of bowel perforation, sepsis, or necrosis, but this patient does not show any signs of peritonitis or guarding suggestive of these complications. Antibiotics are not routinely indicated in the management of bowel obstruction. Manual disimpaction (Choice E) can be helpful in cases of constipation and obstructing rectal stool burden.

Cerebral vasculitis (Choice B) is rare and can present with neurologic deficits, headache, seizures, or coma. Symptoms of dizziness, neck pain, cranial nerve deficits, ataxia, and dysarthria are more consistent with vertebral artery dissection. Lacunar infarcts (Choice C) are ischemic strokes that occur in small penetrating arteries, most commonly involving the basal ganglia or internal capsule. Internal capsule lacunar infarcts can present with purely motor deficits that cause contralateral hemiparesis, ataxic hemiparesis (contralateral hemiparesis plus ataxia), or clumsy hand-dysarthria (hand weakness plus articulation difficulties). Occasionally, sensory symptoms can accompany motor weakness. Ruptured aneurysm (Choice D) typically leads to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhages present acutely with severe headache and an absence of focal neurologic deficits because the hemorrhage occurs in the subarachnoid space rather than the brain parenchyma."

Oral ingestion of hard candies (Choice D) is an effective way of increasing blood sugar in a patient with intact mental status. However, this patient is delirious and cannot be given anything by mouth because of concerns about his ability to protect his airway if an aspiration or emetic event occurs. He may not be able to follow the command to swallow, and his cough and gag reflexes may be impaired, both of which increase the risk for aspirating the hard candy and irreversibly occluding his airway. Rectal administration of dextrose (Choice E) is a less timely and reliable method of increasing blood sugar. This patient is experiencing severe neurologic manifestations of hypoglycemia, and the quickest method of increasing his blood sugar is necessary."

Tension pneumothorax can be a complication of a penetrating thoracic trauma and occurs when air is able to enter the pleural space but is prevented from exiting. Increasing amounts of trapped air in the pleural space compress the lung parenchyma, creating an inability for the lung to expand and causing it to collapse. As the pneumothorax progresses and continues to increase in size, it can result in tracheal and/or mediastinal deviation away from the affected hemithorax.

Pericardia! window (Choice C) or pericardiocentesis (Choice D) would be indicated in cases of traumatic pericardia! effusion causing cardiac tamponade. Tamponade presents with hypotension, jugular venous distention, distant heart sounds, and pulsus paradoxus. This patient has decreased breath sounds, tachypnea, and hypoxia, making pneumothorax more likely.",
        "E": "Thoracotomy is an invasive procedure that allows for control of thoracic hemorrhage, decompression of cardiac tamponade, or management of aortic or pulmonary hemorrhage. It can be indicated in cases of penetrating trauma with hemodynamic instability despite appropriate management, or of pulselessness and receiving CPR for less than 15 minutes with witnessed previous signs of life. This patient's hemodynamic instability is likely caused by tension pneumothorax, which should be managed by needle decompression and tube thoracostomy, not thoracotomy. Tube thoracostomy (Choice F) typically follows needle decompression, which is an emergent and rapid maneuver that can help temporize the patient in preparation for eventual tube thoracostomy. Tube thoracostomy should be done under sterile conditions and requires several minutes."

CT angiography of the chest is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis. This young patient with new-onset exertional dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, recent lower extremity swelling suggestive of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and tachycardia most likely has a pulmonary embolism (PE). The Wells score for pulmonary embolism can be a helpful tool in determining the likelihood of a DVT or PE and directs the most appropriate diagnostic step, which can include a o-dimer or image-based test such as CT angiography. In patients with a low pretest probability, a negative o-dimer effectively rules out a PE. In those with a higher score, the most appropriate diagnostic test is CT angiography, which is a CT scan with iodinated contrast timed to evaluate the pulmonary arteries. Pregnant patients or those with contraindications to CT scans or contrast can undergo ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scans, although this imaging modality is not universally available. Pulmonary emboli can be found in the main pulmonary, segmental, or subsegmenta l arteries and appear as filling defects on imaging. For patients without evidence of cardiogenic shock, treatment is systemic anticoagulation, which can be accomplished with warfarin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or with direct oral anticoagulants. ECG findings in PE include sinus tachycardia, right-axis deviation, right bundle branch block, an S-wave in lead I, a Q wave in lead Ill, and an inverted T wave in lead Ill. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E. Measurement of serum troponin I (Choice A) is unlikely to lead to a diagnosis in this case. Troponin is a cardiac biomarker that can occasionally be increased in cases of pulmonary embolism with associated right heart strain or failure, but it does not confirm the diagnosis. D-dimer assay (Choice C) is used to rule out PE in patients with a low to intermediate probability of PE, but this patient has a high probability of PE and should proceed directly to CT angiography. Echocardiography (Choice D) is indicated if there is evidence of shock secondary to right ventricular failure. Large pulmonary emboli can cause obstructive shock and right ventricular failure, which is demonstrated on echocardiography by right ventricular dilation or hypokinesis or bowing of the interventricu lar septum into the left ventricle. Measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (Choice E) is appropriate for patients who are suspected to have acute decompensated heart failure. BNP is released by the ventricles in response to stretch from increased volume or pressure. It may be increased in cases of PE with shock but is also nonspecific. Educational Objective: A pulmonary embolism often presents with findings suggestive of a recent DVT (unilateral leg swelling) along with chest pain, tachycardia, and occasional ly hypoxia. In patients with a high probability of PE, CT angiography is the most appropriate",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Infection is the most likely precipitant of this patient's acute chest syndrome (ACS). ACS occurs as a result of vaso-occlusion within the pulmonary microvasculature and is diagnosed in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who present with a new pulmonary infiltrate in the setting of fever or other new respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, increased work of breathing, tachypnea, or hypoxemia. While ACS is a distinct clinical syndrome, it is common ly precipitated by another illness such as bacterial or viral pneumonia, asthma exacerbation with hypoventilation, or fat emboli, among others. It is both impractical and nearly impossible to distinguish ACS from pneumonia, so nearly all patients receive antibiotics to treat bacterial pneumonia. Additional ly, the use of either simple transfusion or exchange transfusion may be a component of therapy. Further treatment involves maintaining normoxia with supplemental oxygen or the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, judicious use of fluids, and aggressive pulmonary hygiene measures, including the use of an incentive spirometer. Patients with a pulmonary embolism should be placed on full anticoagulation while all others should receive prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism. Pain should be managed aggressive ly.",

        "B": "Embolism should always be considered in patients with ACS, but thrombi found within the pulmonary vasculature are more likely to form in situ rather than represent emboli from the veins of the lower extremities. Fat emboli may also precipitate ACS, but these are not visualized on CT angiography and there is no treatment other than supportive care.",
        "C": "Hypoventilation can precipitate ACS, but this patient's prodrome with cough and shortness of breath is more suggestive of pneumonia than hypoventilation in isolation. Similarly, thrombosis (Choice E) can precipitate ACS, but this patient's symptoms prior to presentation suggest an alternative cause."

Fever, tachypnea, and leukocytosis also support a diagnosis of sepsis. Hypotension, cool mottled extremities, and end-organ dysfunction indicate the presence of shock. The patient's risk for developing a severe infection is increased by use of daily corticosteroids and a tumor necrosis factor a blocker for her rheumatoid arthritis.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Cardiac tamponade can result in obstructive shock caused by compression of the cardiac chambers. Findings suggestive of cardiac tamponade include hypotension, jugular venous distention, distant heart sounds, pulsus paradoxus, and a low-voltage ECG. Gastrointestinal bleeding (Choice B) may result in hemorrhagic/hypovolemic shock, and the use of ibuprofen and corticosteroids are risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding. The presence of fever and leukocytosis and the absence of any reported history of bleeding make sepsis a more likely diagnosis. The initial management for both septic and hemorrhagic shock is fluid resuscitation. Non-ST-elevation myocardia l infarction (Choice C) may lead to cardiogenic shock because of impaired ventricular contraction and inadequate cardiac output. Typical findings include jugular venous distention, pulmonary crackles, and a weak pulse. Measuring troponin concentration and performing echocardiography can support or refute the diagnosis. Pulmonary embolism (Choice D) can cause an obstructive form of shock in which the right ventricle fails as it contracts against greater resistance in the pulmonary vasculature. This results in diminished left heart return and cardiac output, with the consequence of decreased perfusion to the right ventricle and further loss of function."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Abscess formation occurs in the settin Correct Answer: B. Abscess formation occurs in the setting of an acute inflammatory response to an infectious organism, resulting in an organized collection of pus, necrotic cellular debris, and infectious organisms present on histology. A bacterial abscess presents with cutaneous erythema, warmth, fluctuance, and purulent drainage, often following inoculation from an injury such as a spider bite, puncture, or abrasion. Systemic symptoms including fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis are often but not necessarily present. Most commonly, abscess formation is acute and results from a bacterial infection of the skin. The two most common pathogens to cause bacterial infections of the skin are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A). S. aureus is most likely to cause a bacterial abscess. It also causes impetigo, erysipelas, and folliculitis. Other less common organisms include C/ostridium perfringens, which infects an open wound and causes necrotizing fasciitis, Enterococcus faecalis, which causes nosocomial infections, and Pasteurel/a multocida, which causes infections secondary to cat and dog bites. Incision and drainage would be appropriate therapy for an abscess to release pus and debris to control the source of the infection. While the patient may also require oral antibiotics, without incision and drainage the oral antibiotics will not effectively penetrate the abscess wall; thus, it is the most important next step.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Biopsy of the affected area is not necessary in this case. Skin biopsy is performed when there is diagnostic uncertainty about the cause of a skin finding and can be used to obtain a sample for culture. It involves surgically removing a small core of skin and submitting it for pathology in formalin or for tissue culture in sterile saline. In this case, the diagnosis of bacterial abscess is clinical, and a biopsy is unnecessary. Oral antibiotic therapy (Choice C) is inadequate in this case without appropriate surgical drainage of the bacterial abscess. While the patient may receive oral antibiotic therapy following incision and drainage, the bacterial source control provided by the surgical procedure is more critical than antibiotic therapy alone. Topical corticosteroid therapy (Choice D) is used to treat inflammatory processes of the skin including dermatitis, psoriasis, and lichen planus. While the presence of erythema around the abscess clearly indicates inflammation, treating this inflammation with topical corticosteroids without treating the underlying cause, a bacterial abscess, will be ineffective. X-ray of the right knee (Choice E) is not necessary in this case because there is no suggestion of bony involvement of the infection. X ray of the right knee will not provide any information about the soft tissue surrounding the abscess. Imaging is unnecessary in this case, but if x-ray evaluation of the soft tissue was necessary, an MRI would be more appropriate."

The presence of hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status indicate an acute shock state, and the patient requires emergent volume resuscitation. Isotonic crystalloid solutions are effective, inexpensive, and readily available in most medical settings. Incorrect Answer: A, B, C, and D. Urine toxicology screening (Choice A) does not take precedence over immediate fluid resuscitation. It may be considered as part of the evaluation for the underlying cause of the patient's fall and somnolence, and it could rule out toxic ingestions that may be contributing factors. CT scan of the head (Choice B) is not recommended prior to fluid resuscitation because the patient's condition is likely to deteriorate rapidly in the imaging suite if her shock is not addressed first. CT scan of the head may be considered after the patient is stabilized as part of the evaluation for her fall and somnolence. Administration of 5% dextrose (Choice C) is not recommended because it is a hypotonic solution (the dextrose component is readily taken up into cells) and water shifts out of the vasculature, rendering it less effective than isotonic crystalloids. Administration of 5% dextrose may be considered if it is the only fluid option available or as an adjunct to isotonic crystalloid solutions in the setting of hypoglycemia. Administration of insulin (Choice D) is not indicated at this time. The patient has a normal blood glucose concentration, and her somnolence and metabolic acidosis are better explained by sepsis and potential acute renal injury than by a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Upper endoscopy is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis in this patient with signs and symptoms of upper gastrointestina l bleeding (UGIB). Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is often separated into upper and lower GI bleeding. Patients with UGIB often present with dizziness or light-headedness, nausea, epigastric pain, and melena. Occasionally, as in the case of variceal bleeding, hematemesis may accompany these symptoms. Laboratory findings may show an increased blood urea nitrogen concentration, but the decrease in hemoglobin concentration often lags behind clinically significant bleeding. Treatment should initially focus on resuscitation with crystalloids and erythrocyte transfusion as needed. All patients are started on an intravenous proton pump inhibitor, and patients with cirrhosis and suspected variceal bleeding should receive octreotide and antibiotics. Major causes of UGIB aside from esophageal varices include Mallory-Weiss tear, peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, esophagitis, and angiodysplasia. Rare causes include Dieulafoy lesion, gastric antral vascular ectasia, and aortoenteric fistula. After patients have been stabilized, upper endoscopy should be performed both to determine the cause of bleeding and to intervene on any lesions that are amenable to treatment, such as bleeding ulcers or visibly bleeding blood vessels.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "CT scan of the abdomen is insensitive for evaluating the cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. Resuscitation followed by endoscopy should generally be performed first. If no cause of bleeding is identified, then CT angiography may be able to localize brisk bleeds that exist at locations distal to the duodenum.",
        "B": "Colonoscopy is the intervention of choice when patients are suspected of having a source of lower GI bleeding such as diverticulosis or angiodysplasia, which often presents with hematochezia rather than melena. Celiac angiography (Choice D) is not the correct answer. Angiography can be performed if there is suspicion of a brisk bleed at a site distal to the duodenum that cannot be reached by an endoscope. If a bleeding vessel is identified, embolization can be performed, but this should never be the first step in evaluation of GI bleeding. Exploratory operation (Choice E) is indicated in patients who develop perforated bowel. While this can occur in the setting of gastric or duodenal ulcers, it is rare, and patients often have peritoneal signs on examination and evidence of sepsis, which this patient lacks."

Simple and uncomplicated febrile seizures are generalized and defined as lasting less than 15 minutes and not recurring within a 24-hour period, whereas complex febrile seizures are focal, prolonged, and recurring. It is important to differentiate febrile seizures secondary to a viral illness from a bacterial central nervous system infection, which can also present with fever and seizure, but patients are typically ill-appearing and may have signs of meningismus. In patients with febrile seizures that have spontaneously resolved, active treatment with benzodiazepines is not necessary and the fever can be treated symptomatically with antipyretics (eg, acetaminophen). Most children who present with simple febrile seizures can be discharged safely as long as they have returned to baseline and parents are given anticipatory guidance and strict return precautions. Children with focal or prolonged seizures may require further observation, intervention, or diagnosis, especially if there is delayed recovery to baseline or a prolonged postictal phase.",

This patient presents with symptoms consistent with unstable angina, defined by angina symptoms that are new, occur at rest, or are worsening in severity. Unstable angina is a type of acute coronary syndrome, which requires urgent diagnostic workup including serial ECGs, troponin testing, cardiology consultation, and myocardial perfusion testing, stress testing, or cardiac catheterization. Nitroglycerin is a potent venodilator that decreases cardiac preload and myocardial oxygen demand, making it a first-line therapy in the treatment of angina pectoris along with aspirin, which inhibits platelet aggregation. Patients with unstable angina are stratified on the basis of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score, which assists in identifying the need for therapeutic anticoagulation and coronary angiography. In this patient with improving chest pain, a normal ECG, and serial troponin concentrations within the reference range, the most appropriate next step in management is urgent myocardial perfusion testing.",

Emergent cardiac catheterization (Choice B) would be appropriate in cases of acute myocardial infarction, which would present similarly with anginal chest pain but would have ECG changes showing ST-segment elevation and increased concentrations of serum troponin. This patient's diagnostic work-up shows no abnormalities, making acute myocardial infarction unlikely. This patient may require cardiac catheterization because his TIMI score is high; however, it (or a noninvasive stress test) should occur urgently within 3 days, as opposed to emergently.

In penetrating abdominal trauma, evaluation of the depth of the wound tract is quickly done to determine whether it has violated the peritoneum. Gunshot wounds are particularly high-ene rgy and can cause severe intra-abdomina l injury including hemorrhage and viscus perforation. Laparotomy of the abdomen is indicated for hemodynamically unstable patients (eg, tachycardia and hypotension) presenting after penetrating abdomina l trauma because it permiits the control of hemorrhage and the repair of identified injuries. In stable cases, imaging precedes surgical intervention.",

Contrast study of tracts can be used to evaluate patency and location of things like gastrostomy tubes, cholecystostomy tubes, and jejunostomy tubes. CT scan of the abdomen (Choice D) would be helpful in diagnosing other traumatic injuries such as liver or splenic lacerations, duodenal hematoma, bowel perforation, or retroperitoneal hematoma. However, for patients who are hemodynamically unstable, a CT scan may delay diagnosis and prompt management of intra-abdominal injuries. Intravenous pyelography (Choice E) involves the intravenous injection of radio-opaque contrast to visualize the renal collecting system, ureters, and bladder under fluoroscopy. This allows for the investigation of suspected urinary tract anatomic abnormalities, malignancies, and strictures.",

Peritoneal lavage (Choice H) is used for the evaluation of hemoperitoneum in abdominal injury. While it has mostly been replaced by evaluation with ultrasonography, CT scan, or laparoscopy, it may be useful in situations with equivocal results or in low-resource settings.

It is caused by widespread lgE-mediated mast cell degranulation and is characterized by histaminergic responses within multiple organ systems leading to flushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and vasodilation, which can lead to airway obstruction and circulatory collapse. It is generally acute in onset following a specific exposure and generally does not self-resolve. If not managed promptly, death can occur from hypoxia and/or distributive shock. Anaphylaxis is a form of distributive shock, which is characterized by a primary reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). This reduction in SVR is secondary to lgE-mediated histamine and cytokine release. Cardiac output increases to compensate for low SVR in the early stages of distributive shock. If the inciting state is not appropriate ly treated, further decompensation can occur, resulting in progressive hypotension and insufficient perfusion with associated end-organ damage.

Acute serum sickness (Choice A) is a type Ill (immune complex-mediated) hypersensitivity reaction in which antibodies to foreign proteins are produced and immune complexes deposit in membranes, leading to tissue damage. It typically presents with fever, urticaria, arthralgias, proteinuria, and lymphadenopathy 5 to 10 days after exposure. Anaphylaxis is typically an immediate and acute reaction. Cardiogenic shock (Choice C) can occur in diseases such as myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. In cardiogenic shock, there is severe dysfunction of the cardiac myocytes resulting in markedly decreased contractility, tachycardia, hypotension, and impaired end-organ perfusion (cool extremities and low urine output). Disseminated intravascular coagulation (Choice D) presents with bleeding, thrombocytopenia, increased prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times, decreased plasma fibrinogen concentration, and increased d-dimer and fibrin split product concentration. It can be caused by trauma, severe sepsis, and occasionally malignancy. It is unlikely to cause hypotension unless the patient is experiencing severe bleeding resulting in hemorrhagic shock or refractory sepsis. Septic shock (Choice E) is characterized by vasoplegia (impaired response of the vasculature to vasoconstricting stimuli) with markedly decreased systemic vascular resistance, which can cause hypotension and tachycardia. However, sepsis typically occurs because of an overwhelming bacterial infection, and this patient's immediate and acute symptoms are more likely caused by antigen exposure and anaphylaxis."

A 71-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her family because of a 1-day history of intermittent agitation and confusion. During the past 2 days, she has had a cough and has felt cold. She has hypertension, coronary artery disease, and Graves disease; she takes lisinopril, methimazole, and lovastatin. She has no known allergies. On arrival, she is oriented to person but not to place or time. Her temperature is 39.4 °C (103°F), pulse is 150/min and regular, respirations are 26/min, and blood pressure is 114/52 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. The skin is warm and moist to the touch. Cardiac examination shows no murmur or gallop. Rhonchi are heard in the right lung base. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Cranial nerves, motor function, sensation, and cerebellar function appear to be intact, but patient agitation prevents a detailed neurologic examination. Patellar reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. 'I 3. Item 1 of 2 In addition to x-ray of the chest, which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis? A) Blood culture B) Complete blood count with differential C) CT scan of the head D) Measureme nt of serum calcium and magnesium concentrations E) Thyroid function testing Correct Answer: E. Thyroid storm is a serious potential complication of hyperthyroidism. It typically occurs in a patient with a known diagnosis of hyperthyroidism following physiologic stress from surgery or trauma, or in the setting of infection, such as in this patient who presents with signs and symptoms of pneumonia. Signs and symptoms of thyroid storm include hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, diaphoresis, agitation, tremor, hyperreflexia, nausea, and diarrhea, and may progress to high-output heart failure, obtundation, seizure, or coma. The initial diagnosis of thyroid storm is made through a combination of clinical features and thyroid function testing, which shows increased serum concentrations of triiodothyronine (T and thyroxine (T and a decreased ) ), 3 4 concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Management requires supportive care, treatment of the underlying provocative stress, as well as intravenous corticosteroids, ~-adrenergic blockers, propylthiouracil, and potassium iodide. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Blood culture (Choice A) is an appropriate step for the diagnosis of bacteremia and sepsis. This patient's altered mental status, hyperreflexia, and known history of Graves disease is more concerning for thyroid storm Exam Section: Item 3-4 of 50 B) Complete blood count with differential C) CT scan of the head D) Measureme nt of serum calcium and magnesium concentrations E) Thyroid function testing Correct Answer: E.

Signs and symptoms of thyroid storm include hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, diaphoresis, agitation, tremor, hyperreflexia, nausea, and diarrhea, and may progress to high-output heart failure, obtundation, seizure, or coma. The initial diagnosis of thyroid storm is made through a combination of clinical features and thyroid function testing, which shows increased serum concentrations of triiodothyronine (T and thyroxine (T and a decreased ) ), 3 4 concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Management requires supportive care, treatment of the underlying provocative stress, as well as intravenous corticosteroids, ~-adrenergic blockers, propylthiouracil, and potassium iodide. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Blood culture (Choice A) is an appropriate step for the diagnosis of bacteremia and sepsis. This patient's altered mental status, hyperreflexia, and known history of Graves disease is more concerning for thyroid storm. Complete blood count with differential (Choice B) may disclose neutrophilia in the setting of pneumonia or leukocytosis in the setting of thyroid storm. These findings are relatively nonspecific and are less useful for the diagnosis in comparison to thyroid function testing. CT scan of the head (Choice C) is useful for excluding the presence of intracranial mass lesions prior to performing a lumbar puncture in patients with meningitis. Meningitis presents with fever, headache, photophobia, phonophobia, and neck stiffness, with possible Kernig or Brudzinski signs on examination. Measurement of serum calcium and magnesium concentrations (Choice D) may be useful for assessing potential causes of hyperreflexia. However, this patient's vital signs and her known history of Graves disease suggest thyroid storm rather than electrolyte derangement as the most likely cause of her hyperreflexia. Educational Objective: Thyroid storm is a serious potential complication of hyperthyroidism. It typically occurs in patients with a known diagnosis of hyperthyroidism following physiologic stress, such as infection (eg, pneumonia), surgery, or trauma. Thyroid storm presents with vital sign instability, mental status changes including agitation, obtundation, or coma, tremor, seizures, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, nausea, diarrhea, and potential high-output heart failure Exam Section: Item 3-4 of 50",

High rates of gallstone formation are also seen after periods of rapid weight loss, though the mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood. Acute cholecystitis typically presents with fever, abdominal pain, and tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant, often in a patient with a history of biliary colic and cholelithiasis. The pain may also radiate to the right shoulder or interscapular region. It may be distinguished from biliary colic by its constant rather than intermittent nature and associated findings of fever and leukocytosis. Abdominal ultrasonography is the first-line diagnostic examination for the evaluation of potential acute cholecystitis. Characteristic ultrasonography findings of acute cholecystitis include gallbladder wall thickening and hyperemia, pericholecystic fluid, presence of gallstones, a dilated cystic duct or common bile duct, and a sonographic Murphy sign (pain with compression directly over the gallbladder). Treatment includes supportive therapy, intravenous fluids, intravenous antibiotics, and urgent surgical resection of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy).

Failure to place the patient in Trendelenburg position (Choice C) may increase the difficulty of placing a central venous catheter in the jugular or subclavian veins. However, this positioning may not be possible in very ill patients and is not mandatory for the treatment of shock. Positioning may skew measurement of central venous pressure, though no abnormality in positioning is suggested in this case. Improper placement of the central venous catheter (Choice D) is unlikely given the successful administration of antibiotics and fluids. This patient's refractory hypotension is more concerning for septic shock than for a misplaced central line."

This patient is presenting with shortness of breath and shallow respirations with associated hypercarbic respiratory failure as seen on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. This patient likely has underlying obstructive lung disease secondary to obstructive sleep apnea or obesity hypoventilation syndrome , as evidenced by an increased HC0 indicating a compensatory metabolic alkalosis in the setting of 3 respiratory acidosis. Nevertheless , and regardless of the reason for the derangement , this patient's hypercarbia is severe, acute on chronic, and causing persistent respiratory acidosis as evidenced by a decreased pH in spite of noninvasive and appropriate corrective measures. Hypercarbia is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's decreased level of consciousness and is likely compounding baseline deficits from dementia . Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is often the first step in the management of hypercarbic respiratory failure, but if it is insufficient, as in this case with continued altered mental status and severe acidosis, endotracheal intubation to protect the airway and facilitate invasive positive pressure ventilation is necessary. Incorrect Answers : A, B, C, and D. Adjusting bilevel positive pressure ventilation settings (Choice A) would be appropriate if the patient showed a positive response to initial treatment or if initial settings were incorrect or inadequate. However, the patient's mental status remains unchanged , making intubation a more appropriate next step. Administering albuterol, helium, oxygen, or methylprednisolone (Choices B, C, and D) can be helpful in the setting of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and may be helpful in this patient with hypercarbic respiratory failure. However, medical management should follow endotracheal intubation, which is the most appropriate next step.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Gastritis classically presents with left upper quadrant or epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. If erosive gastritis or an ulcer is present, emesis may be blood-streaked, frankly bloody, or coffee-ground in character. If bleeding has been present for several hours, stool may be melanotic. Gastritis commonly occurs from alcohol abuse, excess use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, infections, or smoking. Other causes of upper gastrointestina l (GI) bleeding include esophagitis, esophagea l varices, peptic ulcer disease, and arteriovenous malformations. Regardless of the cause of bleeding, any patient presenting with tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, and signs of hemorrhagic shock (such as this patient's borderline hypotension) should receive immediate intravenous fluid resuscitation, typically with isotonic crystalloids such as 0.9% saline. Massive hematemesis, persistent hemodynamic instability, or concern for active bleeding should prompt emergent blood transfusion.",

        "C": "Insertion of a nasogastric tube has a role in gastric decompression in cases of small bowel obstruction but does not have a primary role in the management of undifferentiated upper gastrointestina l bleeding. It is arguably contraindicated in cases of esophageal varices, as placement of the tube may exacerbate a variceal bleed by disrupting a thrombus or worsening the culprit bleeding lesion. A tagged red blood cell scan (Choice D) can be used in the diagnosis of lower gastrointestina l bleeding to evaluate for the site of bleeding. In this case, the patient is likely experiencing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be diagnosed with upper endoscopy. Regardless, further diagnostic tests are not appropriate prior to managing this patient's hemodynamic instability. Upper endoscopy (Choice E) is the definitive means of diagnosis and treatment for a patient with gastrointestinal bleeding suspected to come from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum (upper GI tract). However, it should take place after fluid resuscitation and stabilization of the patient's hemodynamics."

Intravenous potassium supplementation should always be given before insulin if the serum potassium concentration is below 3.5 mEq/L as insulin causes potassium to shift intracellularly, which can lead to life-threatening hypokalemia with consequent cardiac arrhythmias and death. The potassium concentration should be monitored frequently during intravenous insulin administration and should be repleted when it falls below 3.5 mEq/L.",

Management of heat-related illness involves removing the individual from the heat, removing excess clothing, and initiating cooling measures such as immersion in cool water or evaporative cooling. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. While exercise can lead to the depletion of magnesium (Choice A), it would not explain the patient's hyperthermia and altered mental status. Exercise typically causes hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia (Choice B) as a result of potassium release from muscle cells. Potassium derangement would generally only cause muscle cramps and ECG abnormalities and would not completely explain the clinical picture in this case. High-output cardiac failure (Choice C) presents with shortness of breath, orthopnea, paroxysma l nocturnal dyspnea, and peripheral edema, often in the setting of an arteriovenous fistula, cirrhosis, sepsis, or severe anemia. In an athlete presenting after running a marathon, heat stroke is more likely. Creatine kinase is an enzyme found primarily in muscle cells, which is released in states of myocyte destruction or turnover and serves as an accurate surrogate marker for myocyte injury. Intense exercise can lead to myocyte injury and rhabdomyolysis, characterized by myalgias, myoglobinuria, and acute kidney injury. While exercise can release creatine kinase from muscle cells (Choice E), it would not be sufficient to explain the patient's hyperthermia and altered mental status."

Renal calculi typically cause symptoms of unilateral acute flank or back pain, nausea, vomiting, and hematuria. There are three main sites of anatomic narrowing along the ureter that may obstruct the passage of a calculus: at the ureteropelvic junction of the renal pelvis and the ureter, the ureterovesical junction as the ureter enters the posterior bladder, and at the pelvic inlet when the ureter crosses the common iliac vessel bifurcation.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cardiogenic pulmonary edema results from increased filling pressures or impaired forward flow in the heart. This increases hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary venous circulation, resulting in the transudation of fluid from the pulmonary capillaries into the pulmonary interstitial and alveolar spaces, impairing gas exchange. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema can be brought on suddenly by an increase in blood pressure (known as \"flash\" pulmonary edema), which is likely the cause in this case. Patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema typically experience progressive dyspnea on exertion and then at rest, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and orthopnea. Physical examination findings include hypoxia, crackles (representing fluid-filled alveoli opening suddenly), and decreased breath sounds. Initially, crackles will be present only in the dependent regions of the lung, but with increasing severity of edema, will spread to involve the lung fields diffusely. This patient's lower extremity edema further suggests a status of volume overload. The chest x-ray also demonstrates diffuse interstitial infiltrates, suggesting pulmonary edema.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Acute bilateral pneumonia would not explain this patient's chest x-ray findings or peripheral edema. A patient with an acute infection may also be hypotensive as a feature of sepsis rather than severely hypertensive, as in this case. COPD exacerbation (Choice C) is characterized by shortness of breath and shallow respirations with wheezing present on physical examination. Accumulation of carbon dioxide as a result of the inability to fully expire will also cause a respiratory acidosis, which may present with altered mental status. The patient's physical examination findings are more consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Large, left-sided pleural effusion (Choice D) would demonstrate opacification of the left hemithorax with blunting of the left costophrenic angle. Physical examination would demonstrate dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds on the left side only. This patient's physical examination and x-ray findings instead suggest cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Pulmonary embolism (Choice E) presents with acute onset dyspnea and may present with pleuritic chest pain. Asymmetric lower extremity edema may be present, indicating the presence of a deep venous thrombosis. However, diffuse crackles and diffuse interstitial infiltrates are not characteristic. Additionally, hypotension and hemodynamic instability would be more likely than hypertension, especially in the setting of a large enough embolus to result in tachycardia and a new oxygen requirement."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction lasting less than 24 hours caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without evidence of infarction. This patient has developed focal neurologic deficits that resolved after 30 minutes, qualifying as a TIA. TIA can be induced by either an embolus arising from a proximal site or from temporarily decreased blood flow to a watershed area in the brain. A \"low-flow\" TIA typically lasts minutes while an embolic TIA lasts longer, as in this case. An embolic ischemic stroke involves an event in which a clot breaks off and travels to the brain, occluding blood flow within a cerebral artery. Emboli most commonly originate from proximal vessels, such as the internal carotid artery, or from an atrial thrombus. If the embolus successfully undergoes physiologic thrombolysis, blood flow is restored to the affected area and reverses the clinical symptoms. After a TIA, measures for the prevention of an ischemic stroke should be enacted. In this case, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to administer for secondary prophylaxis of a cerebral infarction is aspirin. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are also stroke risk factors which should be optimized, though in this case the patient is already receiving treatment for these comorbidities.",

        "B": "Clopidogrel or dipyridamole (Choice C) may be used as combination therapy with aspirin in patients with a TIA or stroke who are already taking aspirin. However, as this patient's only previous medications are lisinopril and pravastatin, aspirin is the first-line choice for secondary prophylaxis of a cerebral infarction. Tissue plasminogen activator (Choice D) is used for its thrombolytic properties to treat ischemic stroke provided that it can be initiated within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Because this patient's symptoms have resolved, she does not require tissue plasminogen activator. Oral anticoagulation with warfarin (Choice E) may be indicated in a patient with atrial fibrillation who develops a TIA. However, in this patient whose only comorbidities are hyperlipidemia and hypertension, warfarin is not indicated and carries an unnecessary increased risk for bleeding."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The spleen is one of the most common organs damaged during blunt abdominal trauma, with injury patterns such as laceration and rupture. Ultrasonography demonstrates the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, with hypoechoic fluid in between the spleen and the left kidney, raising concern for acute blood products in the setting of trauma. Splenic rupture can cause large amounts of blood to leak into the peritoneal and retroperitoneal spaces, which can result in hemodynamic instability characterized by tachycardia and if severe, hypotension. Patients with splenic injuries may have left upper quadrant tenderness, peritonitis from blood products irritating the peritoneum, or referred pain to the left shoulder secondary to diaphragmatic irritation. In hemodynamically stable patients, minor splenic injuries may be treated nonoperatively with observation and reassessment. In unstable patients, exploratory laparotomy is required for repair of the injury or splenectomy, depending on the nature and severity of the splenic injury.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Duodenal hematoma can occur after blunt abdominal trauma to the epigastric region, especially in children (eg, seat belt injury). The presentation can be subtle with nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and decreased oral intake. Patients may demonstrate a midline mass on examination along with increased amylase and lipase concentrations on laboratory examination caused by associated pancreatitis. Duodenal hematomas can be diagnosed on CT scan of the abdomen, but not on a focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination, which evaluates for free fluid in the abdomen. Laceration of the inferior vena cava (IVC) (Choice B) is an uncommon injury because of its retroperitoneal position and protection by surrounding structures. An IVC injury can lead to severe hemorrhage and high mortality. Because of its retroperitoneal location, free fluid may not appear on a FAST examination, which primarily evaluates for intraperitoneal blood and fluid. As a result of its retroperitoneal location, laceration of the left kidney (Choice C) would not cause intraperitoneal free fluid. A FAST examination showing intraperitoneal free fluid in the left upper quadrant is more likely caused by a splenic injury. Kidney injury can present with hematuria and is best evaluated with a CT scan. Perforated viscus (Choice D) can present after blunt abdominal trauma with abdominal pain, distention, tenderness to palpation, peritonitis, anemia, leukocytosis, and x-ray evidence of pneumoperitoneum. Peritonitis requires an emergent surgical laparotomy to identify and repair any perforation, lavage the peritoneum, and prevent sepsis, exsanguination, and bowel necrosis."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient's laboratory panel suggests severe dehydration as the primary aberrancy driving his clinical picture. Features of severe Correct Answer: C. This patient's laboratory panel suggests severe dehydration as the primary aberrancy driving his clinical picture. Features of severe dehydration include hypotension, tachycardia, decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, and flat neck veins. His severely increased creatinine concentrations suggests acute prerenal kidney injury, which is caused by ineffective perfusion of the kidneys, whether caused by hypovolemia, as in this case, or hypotension. His hyperglycemia also suggests a high serum osmolality induced by dehydration as does his hypercalcemia. Treatment of dehydration and prerenal kidney injury is with intravenous isotonic fluids, such as 0.9% saline. This will expand his intravascular volume and improve perfusion to the kidneys. However, if decreased perfusion to the kidneys persists to the point of ischemia, then acute tubular necrosis, a form of intrinsic kidney injury, can develop. Prerenal and intrinsic kidney injury can be distinguished by the fractional excretion of sodium, which is <1 % in prerenal and >2% in intrinsic kidney in Jury.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Administration of insulin is not the best first step as the primary cause of his hyperglycemia is dehydration. Administering insulin would be critical if the patient were demonstrating signs of diabetic ketoacidosis. However, he has a normal serum bicarbonate and anion gap at this time. Thus, addressing his dehydration will likely resolve the majority of his hyperglycemia and should be the first step in management. Administration of metoprolol (Choice B) is not appropriate in this case as the patient is tachycardic as a result of dehydration, not because of a primary arrhythmia. The patient's decreased intravascular volume and consequent decreased stroke volume require tachycardia to maintain cardiac output and hemodynamic stability. If metoprolol were administered, his heart rate would decrease, and he would likely begin to suffer further complications of inadequate perfusion and end-organ ischemia. CT scan of the head (Choice D) may be warranted as a component of this patient's work-up but is not the most appropriate first step in management. If the patient is still disoriented after correcting his metabolic disturbances, then a CT scan of the head is warranted.",
        "E": "Hemodialysis is indicated when acute kidney injury causes severe acidemia, electrolyte disturbances such as hyperkalemia , volume overload, or uremia. None of these are present in this case. This patient's prerenal kidney injury will likely correct with intravenous fluid administration. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder (Choice F) is indicated in patients whose acute kidney injury is suspected to be caused by postrenal obstruction causing hydronephrosis, such as nephrolithiasis or an enlarged prostate. This patient's clinical and laboratory picture are more consistent with a prerenal cause."

This patient's history of wrist pain overlying the snuffbox following a fall on an outstretched hand, as well as her radiographic findings, are consistent with a scaphoid fracture. The scaphoid is at significant risk for fracture after falling on an outstretched hand because of its narrow and fragile central waist. Scaphoid fractures can have significant and long-lasting effects as a result of the risk for nonunion and proximal osteonecrosis of the bone, which receives its vascular supply in a distal-to-proximal fashion. Patients with non-displaced scaphoid fractures should undergo thumb spica splinting until union has been demonstrated with follow-up x-rays. Patients with displaced fractures , carpal instability, or delayed presentation should be referred for surgical repair. Incorrect Answers : A, B, C, and D. Activity as tolerated (Choice A) prior to union of the fracture increases the patient's risk for non-union and of prolonged functional deficits. Arthrocentesis (Choice B) is useful for the diagnosis of septic or inflammatory arthritis. This patient's lack of fever and her presentation immediately following a fall are more suggestive of a traumatic fracture of the scaphoid. Elastic bandage and ice packs (Choice C) will result in insufficient restriction of mobility in comparison to a thumb spica splint and are not recommended for the treatment of a scaphoid fracture. Fracture reduction (Choice D) is recommended for displaced scaphoid fractures, carpal instability, or patients with a delayed presentation. This patient's x-rays are more consistent with a non-displaced acute scaphoid fracture.

Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. High-sodium diet (Choice A), in addition to obesity, can contribute to the development of hypertension, which is apparent in this patient, but a high-sodium diet does not predispose to VTE. Lack of exercise (Choice B) is not a risk factor for VTE, although prolonged periods of immobility such as during international flights may confer some increased risk. Uncontrolled hypertension (Choice C) increases the risk for myocardia l infarction and stroke but does not increase the risk for VTE.

Smoke inhalation injury should be suspected in patients presenting with facial burns, hoarse voice, wheezing, soot in the airway, strider, or carbonaceous sputum. The inhalation of smoke and additional chemicals in the setting of a fire presents the risk for injury to the pharyngeal, laryngeal, and tracheal mucosa. Resultant inflammation drives the rapid development of mucosa! edema, which can cause acute airway obstruction. Airway obstruction is an immediate life-threatening condition that must be managed at or before the time it occurs. If care is not taken to immediately maintain an unobstructed path for air to flow into the tracheobronchia l tree, rapid hypoxia, hypercapnia, and death can occur if significant airway edema ensues.

Endotrachea l intubation is the most appropriate next step in management of the patient's airway in the setting of acute smoke inhalation injury. Smoke inhalation injury should be suspected in patients presenting with facial burns, hoarse voice, wheezing, soot in the airway, strider, or carbonaceous sputum. The inhalation of smoke and additional chemicals in the setting of a fire presents the risk for injury to the pharyngeal, laryngea l, and tracheal mucosa. Resultant inflammation drives the rapid development of mucosal edema, which can cause acute airway obstruction. Airway obstruction is an immediate life-threatening condition that must be managed at or before the time it occurs. If care is not taken to immediately maintain an unobstructed path for air to flow into the tracheobronchia l tree, rapid hypoxia, hypercapnia, and death can occur if significant airway edema ensues. Emergent endotrachea l intubation is the most appropriate initial step and should be performed immediately to prevent airway obstruction. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Cyanide inhibits the electron transport chain, leading to lactic acidosis, compensatory respiratory alkalosis, hypotension, lethargy, and bradycardia. The management of cyanide poisoning includes supportive care with intravenous fluids and vasopressors, sodium thiosulfate, which increases the conversion of cyanide to thiocyanate for renal excretion, amyl nitrites (Choice A) to induce methemoglobinemia, which binds with cyanide and prevents it from acting on the electron transport chain, and hydroxocoba lamin (Choice B), which combines with cyanide to create nontoxic cyanocobalamin. This patient may require these interventions but not prior to securing the airway. Arterial blood gas analysis (Choice C) and an x-ray of the chest (Choice E) are not helpful at this time to make further decisions about management. This patient is at risk for imminent airway obstruction as a result of signs of smoke inhalation injury and strider on inspiration, and the next step in management of this patient is endotracheal intubation."

Cellulitis presents with cutaneous erythema, warmth, and induration, often following inoculation from an injury such as an abrasion. Systemic symptoms, including fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosi s are often present. Most commonly, it is acute and results from a bacterial infection of the skin. The two most common pathogens to cause cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A). Clinically, the cellulitis caused by S. aureus is typically purulent while that caused by S. pyogenes is not. Treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis, as seen in this case, is with empiric antibiotic therapy, which covers both S. aureus and S. pyogenes, such as cephalexin. If the cellulitis demonstrates purulence or the patient has a history of prior methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections, coverage of MRSA is also warranted. Potential oral antibiotic choices for MRSA coverage include doxycycline, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, or clindamycin.",

The patient is presenting with classic signs and symptoms of acute coronary syndrome, with angina, nausea, dyspnea, anxiety, and diaphoresis that began during exertion. Additional ly, the ECG shows marked ST-segment elevations in the precordial leads V2 through V6. Polarization and repolarization abnormalities along these vectors correspond with injury to the myocardial territory supplied by the left anterior descending coronary artery, which includes the anterior portion of the interventricular septum, the anterior left ventricle, and the anterolatera l papillary muscle. The left anterior descending artery branches from the left main coronary artery and perfuses a significant portion of the myocardium. An occlusive atherosclerotic or thromboembolic lesion in this vessel resulting in transmural myocardial ischemia and infarction is likely underlying this patient's presentation. Treatment requires the use of antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel) plus anticoagulants (eg, heparin), pain control, and revascularization through angioplasty, thrombolysis, or coronary artery bypass grafting. Potential complications include papillary muscle rupture with subsequent mitral regurgitation, dysrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, ventricular wall rupture, and post-infarction pericarditis.",

Infarction of this territory may result in ST-segment changes in the lateral, posterior, and/or inferior ECG leads (depending on right- or left-dominant coronary artery circulation). The posterior coronary (Choice C) artery, in the setting of a right-dominant circulation (~85% of patients), provides a majority of the blood supply to the inferior portion of the heart. Corresponding ST-segment changes are typically found in the inferior ECG leads II, Ill, and aVF.

Corresponding ST segment changes are typically seen in the inferior ECG leads II, Ill, and aVF. Impaired perfusion to the SA and AV nodes can also result in significant bradycardia or heart block. Septal perforating (Choice E) branches of the left anterior descending artery provide most of the blood supply to the interventricular septum.

The items in the set must be answered in sequential order. Once you click Proceed to Item, you will not be able to add or change an answer. A 73-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by paramedics because of a 4-day history of progressive shortness of breath. Paramedics report that during transport the patient was awake and alert. Pulse oximetry on room air showed an oxygen saturation of 88%; 4 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula was initiated. Diffuse wheezes were heard bilaterally and inhaled albuterol and ipratropium were administered. Medical history includes congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications are furosemide, albuterol, insulin, glyburide, and tramado l. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 50 years. On arrival, he is slow to respond and sleepy but easily aroused. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 167/ 98 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry now shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are normal and reactive. Severe inspiratory and expiratory wheezes are heard on auscultation. 'I 39. Item 1 of 2 Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's change in mental status during transport to the hospital? A) Circulating endotoxins Correct Answer: B. Hypercarbia most likely explains this patient's change in mental status during transport to the hospital. Patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly develop hypercarbia at baseline as a result of their obstructive disease, but acute exacerbations, which are frequently the result of respiratory tract infections, can lead to an acute worsening of the underlying obstruction. Patients present with increased dyspnea and wheezing, which represents turbulent airflow through the constricted bronchial tree. Concurrent cough and sputum production are also common. When the underlying obstruction is exacerbated by a trigger, patients develop profound air trapping and are less capable of expelling carbon dioxide. On arterial blood gas analysis, this manifests as an increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Severe hypercarbia can lead to lethargy and mental status changes. For this reason, all patients with a COPD exacerbation and altered mental status should be evaluated for the presence of hypercarbia. Treatment involves the administration of bronchodilator medications, steroids, and positive pressure ventilation. Occasionally, intubation is required if the patient becomes obtunded. Additionally, patients with COPD tend to have a lower oxygen saturation at baseline as a result of their underlying pulmonary parenchyma l disease. During COPD exacerbations, the goal oxygen saturation should target between 88% to 92%. Historically, administration of supplemental oxygen to raise the saturation beyond this amount has been postulated to blunt respiratory drive, though actual evidence for this is limited. It is probable instead that the administration of supplemental oxygen worsens ventilation-perfusion mismatch in this patient population. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E. Circulating endotoxins (Choice A) may be present in patients with sepsis. This patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation of his COPD d d t h 'd f • Exam Section : Item 39-40 of 50 • Hypercarbia most likely explains this patient's change in mental status during transport to the hospital. Patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly develop hypercarbia at baseline as a result of their obstructive disease, but acute exacerbations , which are frequently the result of respiratory tract infections, can lead to an acute worsening of the underlying obstruction. Patients present with increased dyspnea and wheezing , which represents turbulent airflow through the constricted bronchial tree. Concurrent cough and sputum production are also common. When the underlying obstruction is exacerbated by a trigger, patients develop profound air trapping and are less capable of expelling carbon dioxide. On arterial blood gas analysis, this manifests as an increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Severe hypercarbia can lead to lethargy and mental status changes. For this reason, all patients with a COPD exacerbation and altered mental status should be evaluated for the presence of hypercarbia . Treatment involves the administration of bronchodilator medications , steroids, and positive pressure ventilation. Occasionally, intubation is required if the patient becomes obtunded . Additionally , patients with COPD tend to have a lower oxygen saturation at baseline as a result of their underlying pulmonary parenchymal disease. During COPD exacerbations , the goal oxygen saturation should target between 88% to 92%. Historically, administration of supplemental oxygen to raise the saturation beyond this amount has been postulated to blunt respiratory drive, though actual evidence for this is limited. It is probable instead that the administration of supplemental oxygen worsens ventilation -perfusion mismatch in this patient population. Incorrect Answers : A, C, D, and E. Circulating endotoxins (Choice A) may be present in patients with sepsis. This patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation of his COPD and does not have evidence of sepsis. Hyperglycemic nonketotic coma (Choice C) is incorrect. This patient's symptoms are primarily respiratory, thus his altered mental status is more likely secondary to hypercarbia . A clinical history of hyperglycemia , polyuria, polydipsia, and dehydration would also be expected. Hypoxemia (Choice D) is incorrect. It is common for patients with COPD to have a low oxygen saturation at baseline. This patient's oxygen saturation of 88% corresponds with a partial pressure of oxygen of approximately 55 mm Hg. While this is lower than normal, it would be unlikely to cause altered mental status and may actually be a baseline, around-the-clock saturation for many patients with COPD. Medication adverse effect (Choice E) is incorrect. Insulin and glyburide can cause hypoglycemia, but this patient would likely have demonstrated altered mental status at the time when the paramedics arrived. Tramadol can also cause lethargy, but symptoms would have been expected at the scene. Educational Objective: Acute exacerbations of COPD cause increased air trapping and poor ventilation resulting in progressive hypercarbia. As well, the administration of supplemental oxygen during an acute exacerbation should target a goal oxygen saturation of 88% to 92%, as higher saturations can worsen the patient's underlying ventilation -perfusion mismatch. Severe hypercarbia can cause lethargy and altered mental status. F'",

Major causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) include peptic ulcer disease, Mallory-Weiss tear, gastritis, and Dieulafoy lesion among others, but few etiologies cause hemorrhage as dramatic and potentially catastrophic as ruptured esophageal varices. This patient has evidence of decompensated cirrhosis with a distended abdomen and fluid wave indicating ascites. Both ascites and esophageal varices are consequences of portal venous hypertension, which occurs as a result of obstruction of flow through the sinusoids within the liver. All patients with bleeding esophageal varices should have two large-bore intravenous catheters inserted for the administration of isotonic crystalloids and packed red blood cells (pRBCs). This patient continues to have signs of hemorrhagic shock despite adequate fluid resuscitation; thus, he should also receive pRBCs. Additionally, patients with bleeding varices should receive intravenous antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone, an octreotide infusion, and a proton pump inhibitor. Initial care should focus on stabilizing the patient to facilitate upper endoscopy, at which point varices can be ligated for definitive source control and to prevent further bleeding.",

Even though the international normalized ratio (INR) may be increased in patients with cirrhosis, these patients may be prone to either abnormal clotting or bleeding. Esophageal rupture (Choice C) presents with severe retrosternal pain and signs of sepsis, not gastrointestinal bleeding. Esophageal rupture may occur as a result of trauma, instrumentation during endoscopy, or from violent retching. He/icobacter pylori infection (Choice D) causes peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, which may cause gastrointestinal bleeding, but it does not frequently cause life-threatening hemorrhage and is more likely to present with epigastric pain and melena."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Alcohol use disorder causes changes in the expression of central nervous system y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate receptor subunits, leading to sympathetic hyperactivity in the setting of alcohol withdrawal. Initially, this hyperexcitability results in tremors, anxiety, diaphoresis, hypertension, tachycardia, and nausea. Within hours of the last drink, alcoholic hallucinosis (auditory or visual hallucinations without confusion or autonomic instability) and seizures (as a result of cortical hyperactivity) can occur. Delirium tremens, the most concerning and life-threatening complication of alcohol withdrawal, involves severe confusion and disorientation, fluctuations in consciousness, agitation, visual hallucinations, and autonomic instability (fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure with hyperthermia). As a result of their activating effect on GABA receptors, benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, are effective in reducing the psychomotor hyperactivity associated with alcohol withdrawal. Long-acting benzodiazepines are preferred because they reduce the risk for recurrent seizures. Many centers employ a symptom-based approach to the treatment of alcohol withdrawal using clinical assessment tools such as the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised (CIWA-Ar) scale .",

Treatment with anticonvulsants, such as phenytoin (Choice D) or valproic acid (Choice E), is not typically necessary for seizures associated with alcohol withdrawal and does not address the underlying cause of the seizures. Benzodiazepine or barbiturate doses, in escalation, are most appropriate."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The ECG shows torsades de pointes, a dangerous form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia characterized by a sinusoidal pattern with cyclic variation in amplitude. Episodes are typically brief and resolve spontaneously, but patients are at risk for progressing to ventricular fibrillation , hemodynamic collapse, and death. Patients with prolongation of the Q-T interval (which may be familial or acquired, such as with adverse effects of several medications) ,are susceptible to developing torsades de pointes. Medications that are associated with torsades de pointes include class IA and Ill antijarrhythmic agents, macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics , methadone, antipsychotics , antidepressants , antiemetics, and diuretics such as furosemide . Hypomagnesemia , hypokalemia , and hypocalcemia also increase risk. The patient presentation typically involves palpitations, syncope, lightheadedness , tachycardia , and pallor. Immediate treatment requires intravenous magnesium administration , which inhibits calcium influx into myocardial cells and suppresses early afterdepolarizations to interrupt the arrhythmia. Any potential QT-prolonging medications should be discontinued , and consultation with a cardiologist or electrophysiologist is recommended to determine if long-term pharmacologic therapy or an implantable cardiac device is indicated. Hemodynamically unstable patients generally require cardioversion (which may not be possible given the polymorphic nature of the arrhythmia) or defibrillation . Incorrect Answers : A, B, C, D, and E. Amiodarone (Choice A) is an antiarrhythmic agent that is commonly used to treat ventricular arrhythmias ; however, it causes QT prolongation and can worsen torsades de pointes. Amiodarone should be avoided in this patient. Atropine (Choice B) is an anticholinergic agent used in the treatment of bradyarrhythmias because of its muscarinic inhibition . Atropine increases heart rate and shortens the Q-T interval but is not recommended in the treatment of torsades de pointes . Magnesium administration is standard therapy. Calcium gluconate (Choice C) may be considered in addition to magnesium in the treatment of torsades de pointes, as hypocalcemia increases the risk for the arrhythmia as well. Magnesium should be administered first. Epinephrine (Choice D) is used in the treatment of numerous cardiac arrhythmias as a result of its positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. Increasing the heart rate shortens the Q-T interval and may provide a benefit; however, magnesium has been demonstrated as the most effective initial therapy. Lidocaine (Choice E) may be considered as an adjunct to magnesium for persistent torsades de pointes as it does not prolong the Q-T interval. Magnesium should be administered first.

Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (Choice B) is appropriate for patients with a STEMI who do not have immediate access to a cardiac catheterization suite. Thrombolytics are not given for UA or NSTEMI. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (Choice C) is used as an adjunctive measure in patients with cardiogenic shock secondary to ACS. This patient does not have evidence of cardiogenic shock. Referral to a cardiac surgeon (Choice D) is not appropriate at this time. The patient should first be treated with anticoagulants and antiplatelets followed by cardiac catheterization. In patients with multivessel coronary disease not amenable to cardiac stent placement, coronary artery bypass graft surgery is an alternative option. Ventilation-perfusion lung scan (Choice E) is one imaging modality used to diagnose a pulmonary embolism (PE). While this patient's symptoms could be secondary to a PE, his known cardiac disease, worsening chest pain, and new ECG changes are more consistent with unstable angina."

Rapid electrical depolarization of the heart and resultant increased heart rate impairs diastolic filling time resulting in low cardiac output leading to hypotension. Such a condition is accompanied by the high likelihood of degeneration to ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. Any patient with an unstable, wide-complex tachycardia requires immediate synchronized cardioversion to abort the rhythm and permit improved cardiac output. Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocols are well-established for such cases; unstable patients (hypotensive, diaphoretic, tachypneic, with altered mental status) should be immediately cardioverted. Stable, perfusing wide-complex arrhythmias (normotensive, minimally symptomatic, with easily palpable pulses) can be treated with antiarrhythmic medication. As well, any patient with pulseless wide-complex tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation should receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation and be defibrillated.",

Intravenous administration of morphine (Choice C) is appropriate for treating acute pain; however, it may worsen hemodynamics in an unstable patient. Endotracheal intubation (Choice D) may be necessary for airway protection in a patient with depressed mental status, but this patient is showing no immediate signs of airway compromise; his respiratory symptoms are more likely explained by hypoperfusion which should be addressed immediately. ,. \"' , r-- ,. , Exam Section : Item 3 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "A history of chronic hypertension, especially if poorly controlled, along with acute, tearing , substernal chest pain is suggestive of aortic dissection . The tearing of the tunica intima and media in dissection allows for the creation of a false lumen in which blood can accumulate. Further, branch vessels can become occluded by the false lumen leading to end-organ ischemia. In older patients with a history of hypertension, atherosclerotic disease of the vasa vasorum plus breakdown of normal mural collagen and elastin results in accumulation of basophilic ground substance in place of normal tissue architecture. This process is known as cystic medial necrosis of the aorta. This process occurs predominantly in the tunica media - the smooth muscle layer of the arterial wall - and results in progressive weakening that can lead to an increased risk for thoracic aortic aneurysm formation and aortic dissection.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Aortic dissection due to Takayasu arteritis is less likely than medial degeneration for this patient as it is characterized by granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis in large arteries and is most commonly seen in younger females, especially those of Asian ethnicity; it is less likely to occur in a patient in the sixth decade of life with a history of chronic hypertension. Degeneration of the aortic wall from Marfan syndrome (Choice B) results from a genetic mutation leading to impaired synthesis of collagen. Patients with Marfan syndrome characteristically are diagnosed early in life because of lens dislocation, aneurysmal disease, and joint hypermobility. It can also result in early-onset cystic medial degeneration of the aortic root, which places patients at risk for aortic dissection. Marfan syndrome is less likely the cause of this patient's aortic dissection based on the patient's age and history of hypertension. Rupture of a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (Choice D) would result in exsanguination from the aorta into the surrounding aortic adventitia or mediastinum . Sinus of Valsalva aneurysms occur secondary to a number of pathologies, including syphilis, tuberculosis, and chronic cystic medial degeneration. They are less common than aortic dissection as an explanation of the patient's symptoms. Traumatic disruption of the aorta from a fall (Choice E) results from shear forces applied to the aorta during rapid deceleration injury such as a fall or high-energy collision. This typically presents with large-volume acute blood loss and hemorrhagic shock. ,. \"' , r-- r ,,, Exam Section : Item 4 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

It is often triggered by an allergen. Patients will frequently report worsening of symptoms associated with nighttime, seasonal change, exercise, or exposure to smoke, mold, dust , pollen, or cockroaches. It is diagnosed on clinical history, pulmonary function testing, and/or functional challenge testing (e.g., bronchodilator challenge). Treatment is based on severity and involves avoidance of triggers, the use of short- or long-acting beta-agonists (e.g., albuterol, salmeterol), systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, anticholinergics, mast cell stabilizers, leukotriene inhibitors, and anti-lgE agents. The exact therapeutic regimen depends on severity and frequency of symptoms. Mast cells produce histamines and leukotrienes in response to activation by allergens, which can trigger bronchial smooth muscle reactivity leading to an exacerbation of asthma.",

Classically, pulmonary vasculitis involves chest pain and hemoptysis, not wheezing.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Rapid infusion of 0.9% isotonic saline is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's decompensated hemorrhagic shock. In cases of acute blood loss, small amounts can be tolerated without challenging the ability of the circulatory system to compensate. As the amount of blood loss increases, the circulatory system compensates through fluid retention, increased heart rate, and vasoconstriction. If blood loss continues, these mechanisms become incapable of fully compensating, and shock secondary to hemorrhage occurs . Hemorrhagic shock can be classified by the amount of blood lost, vital signs, physiologic parameters such as falling urine output, exam findings such as diaphoresis, cool extremities, and weak peripheral pulses, and features in the history such as light-headedness. In extreme cases, hypotension occurs, necessitating rapid intravascular volume repletion to prevent circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and death. In the emergent setting, the patient's acute hypovolemia should be replaced with isotonic saline. In hemorrhage, both red blood cells and plasma are lost equivalently; this results in a normal hematocrit , though overall blood volume is decreased.",

This patient demonstrates a clear primary hemorrhagic shock from hematemesis and does not require a pulmonary artery catheter to diagnose or treat at this time. Gastric lavage with ice-cold saline until bleeding stops (Choice D) would not readily replace intravascular volume though it may have an adjunct role in reducing gastrointestinal blood losses; however, emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) (Choice E) is the first choice for definitive hemorrhage control in capable centers .

In this case, dark stools and a hemoglobin concentration of 5 g/dL indicates the patient suffers from high-output heart failure related to underlying severe anemia; the heart must increase cardiac output through an increase in heart rate and potentially in stroke volume to deliver the same amount of oxygen to the body given diminished oxygen carrying capacity from anemia. Oxygen delivery is a function of cardiac output and oxygen content. If oxygen content falls, cardiac output must rise to maintain equivalent delivery. The oxygen content of blood is directly proportional to the amount of hemoglobin and the saturation of that hemoglobin, and to a much lesser extent, directly proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen in the bloodstream.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (OKA) occurs due to the accumulation of serum ketones such as ~-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone in the setting of deficient insulin signaling. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs because of the relative state of starvation created through absent insulin signaling. Patients present with fatigue, polyuria, shortness of breath, and diffuse abdominal discomfort. Vital signs may show tachycardia and tachypnea. Kussmaul respirations, rapid and deep, is a classic physical exam finding because of respiratory compensation for the underlying metabolic acidosis . Labs typically show increased glucose, ketones, and a high anion-gap because of the accumulation of unmeasured anions in serum . Anion gap is calculated as the difference between sodium and the sum of bicarbonate and chloride anions. Treatment is through replacement of insulin, volume repletion, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions. lncorrectAnswers: B, C, D, and E. Accumulation of lactate (Choice B), also known as lactic acidosis, can occur in multiple different situations such as shock, metabolic derangements, and in response to medications. It can also occur in OKA; however, it is not the primary cause of acidosis . Decreased renal production of ammonium (Choice C) and loss of bicarbonate through the kidneys (Choice D) are both causes of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). RTAs are not caused by the accumulation of an unmeasured anion and do not present with an increased anion gap. Movement of potassium into the cells (Choice E) occurs because of transcellular potassium-proton exchange . Increased movement of potassium into the cells occurs when the serum is alkalotic, not acidotic. Acidosis in the setting of OKA stimulates movement of potassium out of the cells into the serum. ,. \"' , r-- r ,,, Exam Section : Item 9 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment",

During the past 3 days, the cough has worsened with episodes so intense that he has vomited . The cough is productive of thick green sputum . He feels well between coughing episodes . He has not had fever, chest pain, or shortness of breath . He takes no medications. He is a college student. His temperature is 37.3°C (99 .2°F}, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 115/65 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. Pulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Influenza B) Legionnaires disease C) Pertussis D) Psittacosis E) Q fever Correct Answer: C. Episodes of severe coughing followed by emesis, in the setting of a respiratory illness, raises suspicion for pertussis. Pertussis is caused by infection from Bordetella pertussis and classically presents in three stages. The catarrhal stage is first, which presents with fever, rhinorrhea, and a mild cough. This progresses to the paroxysmal stage after 1 to 2 weeks, in which patients experience violent bouts of extreme coughing, at times violent enough to cause secondary traumatic injury such as rib fractures, urinary incontinence, and pneumothoraces. Often , such coughing fits are followed by syncope, emesis , or apnea. The paroxysmal stage can last for weeks to months. Symptoms resolve in the convalescent stage, which lasts from 1 to 4 weeks . Pertussis can be prevented with immunization, and is treated with antibiotics, typically macrolides. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E.",
        "D": "Psittacosis occurs in persons with exposure to birds, as a vector is typically required to transmit the infection (Chlamydia psittac,) ; similarly , Q fever (Coxiella bumetit) (Choice E) typically requires exposure to sheep, goats, and cattle as a zoonotic source. ,. \"' , r-- ,. , Medicine Self-Assessment"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Dizziness and gait instability carry a broad differential diagnosis; these symptoms are often divided into central, peripheral, and secondary causes of symptoms to determine a likely diagnosis. Central causes include cerebrovascular accidents such as ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, tumors of the brain stem and cerebellum, infarction involving the vestibulocochlear nerve, and multiple sclerosis or similar demyelinating disorders. Peripheral causes include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, labyrinthitis, Meniere disease, endolymphatic fistula, or temporal bone fractures, tumors, or lesions. Secondary or systemic causes can include electrolyte imbalances, hypovolemia, cardiac arrhythmia, infections, and vitamin deficiencies, among other causes. Labyrinthitis is inflammation of the inner ear, often involving the vestibulocochlear nerve, and is often preceded by an upper respiratory or ear infection. Classic symptoms include vertigo, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hearing loss. Treatment is supportive, along with the exclusion of emergent causes of vertigo and ataxia, as the condition is typically self-limited. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) (Choice A) is a known cause of central vertigo secondary to impingement of the vestibulocochlear nerve at the brain stem. These tumors often occur at the cerebellopontine angle and are often subclinical; there is an association with neurofibromatosis, and they may present with hearing loss, vertigo, and nystagmus. Preceding infection or dulling of the tympanic membranes would not be expected. Cerebral infarction (Choice B) can cause vertigo by disrupting normal neurologic equilibrium and proprioceptive pathways, especially when such infarction involves the cerebellum, pons, or brain stem nuclei involving the oculomotor, trochlear, abducens, or vestibulocochlear nerves. Nystagmus, motor or sensory neurologic deficits, and cranial nerve deficits would be expected in such cases, and the presentation is typically acute. Signs of vertebrobasilar insufficiency, such as nausea, vomiting, dysarthria, and impaired brain stem reflexes may also be present. Dehydration (Choice C) may present with dizziness or ataxia in the setting of orthostatic hypotension, with patients often describing feelings of light-headedness when rising from supine to seated or seated to standing. It is caused by decreased cardiac output from diminished preload and resolves with volume resuscitation. Endocarditis (Choice D) presents with acute or subacute fever, a new or changing heart murmur, septic emboli to the lung or systemic circulation, and vascular and immunologic phenomena such as Roth spots, Osler nodes, Janeway lesions, and splinter hemorrhages. Multiple sclerosis (MS) (Choice F) presents with neurologic symptoms of varying duration separated in space and time. Common symptoms include optic neuritis, which is often the declaring presentation. Women are more commonly affected than men. Any type of neurologic symptom may occur. MS would not be expected to follow an infection though it may be exacerbated by such, and physical exam findings of tympanic membrane dullness (suggestive of inflammation and fluid in the middle ear) would not be present. r-- r \" , r , Medicine Self-Assessment",

Isocyanate exposure (Choice C) occurs from industrial application of paints, varnishes, and foams; exposure has been associated with many pulmonary diseases including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchitis, interstitial pneumonia, asthma, emphysema, and pulmonary edema. lsocyanates are not commonly associated with malignant mesothelioma. Mycobacterium kansasii (Choice D) causes chronic pulmonary infection that resembles tuberculosis, presenting with fever, cough, night sweats, and weight loss, often in patients with immunocompromised states. It would not likely present with pleural plaques following years of working in a shipyard. Mycop/asma pneumoniae (Choice E) is a common cause of atypical pneumonia, and presents with acute cough, fever, chills, and shortness of breath. The chest x-ray would typically demonstrate multifocal infiltrates without pleural plaques. Nocardia asteroides (Choice F) causes nocardiosis, which presents as pulmonary or disseminated infection, often in patients who are immunocompromised. The pulmonary variant presents with fever, night sweats, cough, and weight loss, and chest x-ray demonstrates multifocal infiltrates, often with necrosis. Household dwellers exposed to radon (Choice G) are at risk for malignancy. Exposure typically occurs in the home, especially the basement, in geographic regions of prevalence. Radon diffuses into air within basements and homes, where it is inhaled. The decay products are radioactive, which promotes mutations leading to the development of bronchogenic lung cancer, not mesothelioma. Exposure to silicon (Choice H), similar to graphite, leads to pneumoconiosis, characterized by restrictive lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 18 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Shortness of breath, edema, jugular venous distention (JVD), crackles in dependent areas of lung, a history of poorly controlled hypertension, tachypnea, tachycardia, and an x-ray showing cardiomegaly with cephalization of vessels raises suspicion for cardiogenic pulmonary edema because of increased pressures in the left side of the heart, pulmonary veins, and pulmonary capillaries. Pulmonary edema can also occur from non-cardiogenic sources (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome, multifocal pneumonia, burns/inhalation injuries, high altitude, and drowning). Because of increased left-heart filling pressures in heart failure, the pulmonary venous pressure rises, which in turn results in increased pressures in pulmonary capillaries. This increased hydrostatic pressure results in interstitial edema and eventually alveolar edema. This is seen clinically as shortness of breath and respiratory distress and is supported by signs of hypervolemia such as peripheral edema, JVD, S gallop, and crackles on lung examination. Vital signs typically show tachycardia, 3 hypertension, tachypnea, and hypoxia. Treatment is through diuresis to reduce the patient's hypervolemic state and lower cardiac filling pressure, pulmonary venous, and pulmonary capillary pressure. Nitroglycerin, a venodilator, can also be utilized to shift fluid into capacitance vessels and lower preload. Positive pressure ventilation can also reduce alveolar and interstitial edema and drive fluid back into circulation. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. Aspiration pneumonia (Choice A) presents as shortness of breath, cough productive of sputum, and fever, with a focal consolidation on chest x-ray, often in the superior segment of the inferior right lobe of lung. This is the most common location for an aspiration event to occur when a patient is supine. An aspiration event must be in the history to diagnose aspiration pneumonia; thus, the patient will often have a history of swallowing dysfunction, stroke, oropharyngeal or laryngeal malignancy, or a condition that causes frequent vomiting and retching such as alcoholism or bulimia. Bronchiectasis (Choice B) presents with signs of obstructive lung disease, and often follows chronic pulmonary necrotizing infections, which can occur in the setting of cystic fibrosis, Kartagener syndrome, or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Patients will present with wheezing and mucus plugging, and, unless concomitant right heart failure is present, would not necessarily present with signs of hypervolemia (e.g., edema, JVD). Cephalization of vessels would also be atypical, unless left heart failure were also present. Chest x-ray often shows marked bronchial dilatation and wall thickening. Chronic bronchitis (Choice C) presents with chronic productive cough and signs of obstructive lung disease (e.g., wheezing, air trapping). It often occurs in smokers as a component of the spectrum of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in tandem with emphysema. This commonly results in right heart failure from chronic hypoxemic pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction. This would potentially manifest with JVD, ascites, and lower extremity edema, less likely pulmonary edema. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (Choice D) is caused by an exaggerated immune response (typically type 3 or type 4 hypersensitivity) to an inhaled antigen. It can present in acute, subacute, or chronic forms, with the acute form characterized by shortness of breath, cough, and systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, and rash, following exposure to an antigen. The chest x-ray may be normal at this stage or may show interstitial infiltrates. The subacute and chronic forms commonly present with dyspnea, cough, fatigue, and weight loss, and imaging reveals interstitial inflammation and fibrosis of the lung. Pulmonary function tests generally demonstrate a restrictive pattern. Unless concomitant heart failure were present, signs of volume overload and cephalization of the vessels would be unlikely. Pulmonary embolism (Choice F) is characteristically associated with long periods of immobilization such as orthopaedic surgery, intensive care unit stay, long drives, and long plane flights, because of the association with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) formation from venous stasis. DVT classically presents with unilateral lower extremity edema, and when an embolus travels to the lung, the patient may become symptomatic. Classic symptoms include rapid-onset chest pain and dyspnea; if an infarction has occurred, pleuritic chest pain and hemoptysis may be present. Vital signs are often notable for tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia; hypotension can be present if the em bolus is large enough to obstruct blood flow from the right heart. The lungs are typically clear to auscultation, and cardiomegaly and cephalization of the vessels would be unlikely unless concomitant heart failure were present. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 19 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

If not treated, pericarditis can lead to the development of pericardia! effusions, which if large and quickly accumulating, can result in cardiac tamponade. On exam, pericarditis demonstrates a diastolic friction rub, described as a harsh sound heard in diastole. The condition is diagnosed clinically and supported by increased inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, along with an echocardiogram, which often shows a pericardia! effusion of variable size.

Aortic dissection (Choice B) classically presents as tearing chest or abdominal pain radiating to the back, often with a peripheral pulse or blood pressure deficit, and with neurologic symptoms such as numbness or tingling in an extremity.

Inflammatory endocarditis can occur in systemic lupus erythematosus, such as in Libman-Sacks endocarditis, but is far less common than pericarditis as a cardiac manifestation of the condition . Pulmonary embolism (Choice E) presents with chest pain, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxemia, and often occurs due to a deep venous thrombosis.

Failure to void following removal of an indwelling urinary catheter raises suspicion for post-catheter urethral inflammation with resultant acute urinary obstruction. Such obstruction is more common in older male patients with diminished caliber of the prostatic urethra secondary to baseline BPH. Acute urinary obstruction is a urologic emergency and should be treated with placement of a Foley catheter to prevent bladder rupture or post-renal azotemia.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "is a cause of intrinsic renal failure and occurs secondary to toxin exposure. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and sulfas are common precipitants. It is characterized by decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), rising creatinine, and eosinophils on biopsy and urinalysis. Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) (Choice C) is also a cause of intrinsic renal failure secondary to nephrotoxicity from intravenous contrast dye. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain CIN, and it is clinically seen as rising creatinine and decreased GFR following contract administration. AIN and CIN can occasionally lead to severe renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy. Neither would present with an acute inability to void preceded by the discontinuation of an indwelling catheter. End-stage renal disease (Choice D) is characterized by decreased GFR to the extent that remaining renal parenchyma is unable to support physiologic demand for filtration, fluid balance, and electrolyte and acid base balance, necessitating the use of renal replacement therapy such as dialysis or renal transplant. Apart from catastrophic causes such as acute, severe hypoxia or hypotension, end-stage renal disease typically results from a prolonged natural history related to chronically uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, inflammatory diseases such as vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus, or glomerulonephritis syndromes. Hepatorenal syndrome (Choice E) occurs because of concomitant liver failure and resultant splanchnic vessel shunting; this patient has no evidence of liver failure. lschemic acute tubular necrosis (Choice F) is a mechanism for intrinsic acute renal failure and can lead to end-stage renal disease. Without a history of hypoxia or hypotension, ischemic acute tubular necrosis would be unlikely; additionally, it does not result in urinary retention, but rather low GFR and decreased urine production by the kidney with characteristic muddy brown casts on urinalysis. Myoglobinuric acute renal failure (rhabdomyolysis) (Choice G) results in intrinsic renal failure secondary to toxicity of myoglobin on the renal tubular epithelium, resulting in nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis. It presents with low GFR and decreased urine production by the kidney with muddy brown casts on urinalysis, not acute urinary retention. Prerenal azotemia (Choice H) describes a state of increased blood urea nitrogen, often associated with increased creatinine, because of insufficient delivery of blood to the kidney in states of hypoperfusion. This patient may have diminished cardiac output caused by positive pressure ventilation impairing venous return; however, diminished urine production and low urine output, not rapid anuria following abrupt removal of an indwelling catheter, would be expected. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 25 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Interstitial nephritis is a cause of intrinsic renal failure, and often occurs secondary to medication use, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and sulfas being common precipitants. It is characterized by decreased glomerular filtration rate, rising creatinine, and eosinophilic infiltrates seen on biopsy and detected on urinalysis. Patients will have a history of medication exposure and classically present with low grade fever and diffuse rash. Urinalysis typically reveals eosinophiluria, with occasional WBC casts, increased WBC/hpf, and proteinuria. Treatment involves discontinuing the inciting agent. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, E, and F. Acute tubular necrosis often follows an ischemic or nephrotoxic insult and is commonly seen in patients with cardiac arrest following prolonged resuscitation prior to return of spontaneous circulation and in patients with prolonged cardiogenic, obstructive, distributive, or hypovolemic shock. Nephrotoxic agents such as heavy metals and myoglobin can also precipitate acute tubular necrosis. It is characterized on urinalysis by proteinuria, increased WBC/hpf, muddy brown casts, and visualized tubular epithelial cells on urine microscopy {Choice A). Choice C generally reflects a normal urinalysis, with specific gravity, glucose, protein, white and red cells, and casts all within normal limits. Choice D may reflect pyelonephritis, as WBC casts and bacteria are present. Classically, the number of white cells per high power field along with leukocyte esterase and nitrites are also increased in pyelonephritis. Nephritic syndrome typically presents with red blood cell casts and hematuria {Choice E). Choice F may reflect poorly controlled diabetes or a patient taking a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (e.g., canagliflozin) based on the presence of glucosuria, along with a concomitant urinary tract infection given the presence of increased WBCs and bacteria. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 31 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 31 . A 47-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of progressive fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion . He has not had difficulty breathing at night or chest pain. In addition to a heart murmur that was diagnosed when he was in high school , he has diverticulosis and mild osteoarthritis . He takes no medications except a daily multivitamin . He is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 23 kg/m 2 His temperature is • 37°C (98.6°F) , pulse is 82/min , respirations are 18/min , and blood pressure is 135/90 mm Hg.There is no jugular venous distention . The carotid pulse has a slow upstroke . The lungs are clear to auscultation. A grade 2/6 systolic murmur is heard best at the right sternal border and radiates to the apex. There is no change in the murmur with the Valsalva maneuver . There is a paradoxical splitting of S and a prominent apical impulse . An ECG shows left 2 ventricular hypertrophy ; there is no evidence of infarction . Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's heart murmur? A) Atrial septal defect B) Congenital bicuspid aortic valve C) Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy D) Myxomatous degeneration of mitral valve E) Rheumatic heart disease Correct Answer: B. Congenital bicuspid aortic valve classically presents with early signs and symptoms of aortic stenosis and left-sided diastolic heart failure. Patients may complain of fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, diminished exercise tolerance, or syncope with exertion. Exam findings include a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the upper right sternal border, and pulsus parvus et tardus (weak and delayed) may be noted on examination of peripheral pulses. Because of the chronic increased afterload from a fixed obstruction by the valve, left ventricular hypertrophy and resultant diastolic dysfunction can occur. If early aortic stenosis occurs, the patient may be a candidate for aortic valve replacement. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Atrial septal defect (Choice A) presents with fixed splitting of the S heart sound and is caused by a failure of closure of the embryologic connection between the right and left atria. Blood generally flows from the left 2 atrium into the right atrium, increasing the amount within the right heart and pulmonary circuit. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (Choice C) classically presents with a systolic murmur loudest in the lower left sternal border, which is quieter with increased preload and afterload. It is caused by hypertrophy of the septum, creating an outflow obstruction within the left ventricular outflow tract. It classically presents with syncope or sudden cardiac death in an exercising young athlete with a family history of a similar event. Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve (Choice D) can eventually lead to mitral insufficiency, which presents with a holosystolic murmur; however, this condition would not be expected to cause left ventricular hypertrophy or pulsus parvus et tardus. Rheumatic heart disease (Choice E) commonly causes insufficiency murmurs in the acute phase and stenotic murmurs later in life, predominantly affecting the mitral valve. Rheumatic fever typically presents with joint inflammation, pancarditis, subcutaneous inflammatory nodules, erythema marginatum, and Sydenham chorea. Mitral stenosis itself presents with a diastolic murmur radiating to the axilla. If severe enough, it can result in left atrial enlargement, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and flutter. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 32 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

This patient may require admission to an intensive care unit due to the severity of illness and potential requirement for advanced therapy and frequent monitoring; however, she would not likely require admission to the coronary care unit (Choice A) as she does not present with a primary cardiac pathology. Instillation of talc in the pleural space (Choice C) is used to fuse the visceral and parietal pleura (pleurodesis) in patients with recurrent pneumothoraces or symptomatic malignant pleural effusions. It has no role in the management of empyema. Intravenous corticosteroid therapy (Choice D) may be a useful adjunct to reduce the burden of pulmonary inflammation and improve respiratory mechanics, though it offers no benefit for infectious source control and is not the most appropriate next step. Intravenous heparin therapy (Choice E) is used to treat thrombotic states such as myocardial infarction and thromboembolic disease (eg, deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism). It does not have an immediate role in the management of pneumonia, pleural effusion, or empyema. Oral naproxen therapy (Choice F) has a role in the treatment of pleurisy and fever but offers only symptomatic benefit in this case.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Myocardial infarction classically presents with acute-onset chest pain, often radiating to the neck, jaw, or arm, along with shortness of breath, nausea, and/or light-headedness. Risk factors include a history of smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and/or obesity. If the infarction results in left ventricular dysfunction, patients may experience cardiogenic pulmonary edema resulting in shortness of breath, tachypnea, hypoxia, audible crackles, and an S or S gallop. Diagnosis is made using clinical history, analysis of cardiac biomarkers, and an ECG which may show ST-segment elevation or depression, inverted T-waves, or Q 3 4 waves. Treatment requires the use of antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel) plus anticoagulants (eg, heparin), pain control, and revascularization through angioplasty, thrombolysis, or coronary artery bypass grafting. Complications include dysrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, wall rupture, and post-infarction pericarditis.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Acute pericarditis occurs because of an infectious, inflammatory, or malignant precipitant, and presents as pleuritic chest pain that is exacerbated with lying down. ECG findings include diffuse (not focal) ST elevations and PR depressions. Pericardia! tamponade (Choice C) presents with hypotension, shortness of breath, distant heart sounds, jugular venous distention, and pulsus paradoxus. It occurs following accumulation of either a large volume or rapid-onset pericardia! effusion. Rapid decompression of the pericardia! space is required to prevent ongoing shock. The ECG is typically low voltage and can demonstrate electrical alternans.",
        "D": "Pneumonia presents with cough, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, fever, and abnormal breath sounds. It often follows an upper respiratory infection or aspiration event and is more common in immunocompromised persons. The ECG is often unremarkable, and the chest x-ray can be normal early in the course but may show patchy multifocal infiltrates or a single area of consolidation. Pulmonary embolism (Choice E) presents with acute chest pain, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, often in a patient with deep venous thrombosis or a known hypercoagulable state. Small pulmonary emboli are often undetectable on chest x-ray, and the ECG may be normal or show sinus tachycardia. Large emboli with infarction are often seen on chest x-ray by secondary signs such as wedge-shaped areas of infarction or via the Westermark sign of unilateral oligemia. The ECG in a pulmonary embolus often shows sinus tachycardia, and if there is right heart strain can also exhibit right axis deviation, S wave in lead 1, Q wave in lead 3, and inverted Twave in lead 3 ('S1Q3T3'). ST segment elevation would not be expected. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 34 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Mild forgetfulness without significant impairment in ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living, with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 27/30, is most consistent with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI is often seen prior to a diagnosis of dementia, especially Alzheimer type, and includes amnestic (memory-related) and non-amnestic (language, spatial, executive functional impairment) MCI with generally preserved ability to function independently without significant impairment. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Dementia, Alzheimer type (Choice A) is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - fifth edition (DSM-5) as loss of intellectual function within multiple domains: language, memory, perception, motor skills, attention, orientation, problem solving, and executive function. Presumptive diagnosis involves demonstrating cognitive impairment, often through the MMSE, excluding similar syndromes (e.g., vascular dementia, Lewy Body dementia) and secondary causes such as toxic (e.g., heavy metal poisoning), metabolic (e.g., electrolyte disturbances, uremia, hyperammonemia, vitamin deficiencies), endocrine (e.g., thyroid, adrenal, and parathyroid derangement), infectious (e.g., neurosyphilis, HIV encephalopathy, meningoencephalitis), polypharmaceutical (e.g., sedative-hypnotic and anticholinergic use), and superimposed psychiatric causes (e.g., major depressive disorder). Medication adverse effect (Choice B) is a well-recognized cause of cognitive impairment that is often reversible in elderly persons. Anticholinergics and sedative-hypnotics are frequently cited as causing depressed mental status or delirium when administered to persons with limited cognitive reserve. This patient does not clearly have an abrupt cognitive decline correlated with initiating such medications. Multi-infarct (vascular) dementia (Choice D) is characterized as a stepwise decline in cognitive functioning following vascular phenomena, for example, presenting as progressive loss of function after each cerebrovascular accident in a series of ischemic strokes. Vitamin B (cobalamin) deficiency (Choice E) presents with dementia resulting from nutritional deficiency and is often accompanied by megaloblastic anemia. 12 r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 35 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Exertional chest pain accompanied by shortness of breath that improves with rest is suggestive of stable angina pectoris, caused by cardiac ischemia from insufficient perfusion during exertion through narrowed coronary arteries. This patient presents with worsening symptoms of angina, occurring more frequently and for a longer duration of time. This is consistent with unstable angina, defined by anginal symptoms that are new, occur at rest, or are worsening in severity. Unstable angina is a type of acute coronary syndrome, which requires admission to the hospital and urgent diagnostic workup, including serial ECGs, troponin testing, cardiology consultation, and stress test or cardiac catheterization. Patients with unstable angina are stratified based upon the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score, which assists in identifying the need for therapeutic anticoagulation and coronary angiography.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "monitoring of blood glucose concentration during the next episode of chest pain would not be sufficient for workup of this patient's unstable angina and acute coronary syndrome. This patient's symptoms are unlikely to be associated with hyper- or hypoglycemia. The patient will require admission to the hospital for further monitoring and diagnostic workup. Nonexertional tests, such as dipyridamole-thallium-201 scintigraphy (Choice B), are used to evaluate cardiac perfusion in patients who are unable to exercise. Exercise stress test within 24 hours (Choice C) may be indicated, but first, the patient must be urgently admitted to the hospital for further diagnostic workup and management of unstable angina and acute coronary syndrome. Once further diagnostic tests are completed, the patient's risk can be further delineated using the TIMI score to determine the next most appropriate step in management, which may include stress testing and/or coronary angiography. Antianginal drug therapy now and an exercise stress test in 5 days (Choice D) would unnecessarily delay diagnostic workup of this patient's acute coronary syndrome, which may require coronary angiography and revascularization. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 36 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) has multiple risk factors, including uncontrolled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, excess alcohol consumption, family history, age, and smoking. Reducing ASCVD is a key step in reducing the likelihood of delayed complications such as heart attacks and strokes. The 2019 guideline from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease) states that persons with known ASCVD, such as those having experienced a heart attack or stroke, should be started on a high-intensity statin. The guideline makes several recommendations of moderate or high-intensity statin therapy for persons ages 40 to 75 years at risk for ASCVD based on personal medical history, family history, and laboratory evaluation. Routine screening for persons under age 40 years is generally not recommended apart from reasonable surveillance every 4 to 6 years. Those persons ages 20 to 39 years who are not at an increased risk (below 7.5% risk in the next 10 years), a lifetime or 30-year risk target is reasonable in deciding whether or not to initiate lipid-lowering therapy. Lifestyle modification should always be recommended including weight loss, cardiovascular exercise, smoking cessation, safe alcohol consumption, sleep hygiene, and dietary modification for all persons with an increased level of cholesterol or those at risk for ASCVD. While this patient has increased cholesterol, he has no other obvious personal or family risk factors. Lifestyle modifications should be recommended with routine screening and initiation of lipid lowering therapy if his risk subsequently rises.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Impaired DNA synthesis occurs in the setting of megaloblastic anemia, characterized by the presence of hypersegmented neutrophils, anemia, and increased mean cell Bd. volume (macrocytosis). Commonly, the impairment is due to the absence of required cofactors such as folic acid and cobalamin (vitamin Malnutrition and alcohol use disorder are common causes of folic acid deficiency, while conditions such as pernicious anemia, Crohn disease, and vegan ism can result in cobalamin deficiency. Symptoms include fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance, with pallor and glossitis found on physical examination. Laboratory evaluation reveals anemia, increased mean cell volume, and normal white cell and platelet indices. The presence of hypersegmented neutrophils on peripheral smear is a characteristic finding in megaloblastic anemia. Treatment includes replacing the deficient vitamin and resolving nutritional deficiencies. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Defective porphyrin metabolism (Choice A) is seen in porphyria. Porphyria can arise from genetic mutations, heavy metal poisoning, and as an adverse effect of some medications. It presents with anemia, and often blistering of the skin when exposed to sunlight. Faulty protein transcription (Choice B) can cause many types of anemia; examples include sickle cell anemia and pyruvate kinase deficiency, both of which typically result in hemolytic, normocytic anemias. Inadequate erythropoietin (Choice D) occurs in chronic end-stage kidney disease because of insufficient production from the peritubular capillary interstitial cells. Without erythropoietin, progenitor cells in the bone marrow are not appropriately stimulated to produce red blood cells, resulting in the development of normocytic, non-hemolytic anemia. Unbalanced synthesis of a- and b-globulin chains (Choice E) defines thalassemia, which classically presents as a microcytic anemia in persons of Mediterranean, Asian, and African descent. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 40 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 40 . A 77-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 3-month history of shortness of breath when she climbs stairs . Her shortness of breath resolves after 5 minutes of rest. Her last episode was 3 days ago . She has not had chest pain, palpitations , orthopnea , cough , wheezing , swelling , or difficulty sleeping . She has hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease . Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide , omeprazole , and a multivitamin. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 63 kg (140 lb); BMI is 23 kg/m 2 Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F) , pulse is 72/min , respirations are 12/min , and blood pressure is 144/92 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98% . There are jugular venous pulsations 3 cm above the sternal angle . The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities . An ECG shows a left bundle branch block and no primary T-wave changes, which is unchanged from an ECG 1 year ago . Which of the following is the most appropriate next step to determine the cause of this patient's dyspnea? A) Measurement of serum troponin I concentration B) ECG exercise stress test C) Exercise stress echocardiography D) Ventilation-perfusion lung scans E) Coronary angiography Correct Answer: C. Stable angina is defined as chest pain (or an anginal equivalent) that occurs with exertion or stress and resolves with rest or nitroglycerin. It indicates that an obstruction to flow exists within a coronary artery (coronary artery disease), which results in myocardial ischemia during a period of increased myocardial oxygen demand. Classically, this occurs from atherosclerotic plaque causing narrowing of a coronary artery, with resultant insufficient supply of blood during periods of increased demand. If such a plaque ulcerates and a thrombus forms, complete occlusion of a coronary artery can result, which can lead to myocardial infarction. Diagnosing inducible cardiac ischemia is first attempted by way of a stress test, either through exercise or pharmacologic stress. An exercise stress echocardiography scan is appropriate for patients who are able to exercise but who have a baseline-abnormal ECG that would make a stress ECG difficult to analyze for ischemia (e.g., such as a baseline bundle-branch block that results in ST-segment repolarization change, or inverted T waves). A stress echocardiogram evaluates for regional wall motion abnormalities suggestive of regional ischemia following induction of stress on the heart via exercise. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Measurement of serum troponin I concentration {Choice A) is appropriate in the diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome, blunt cardiac injury, myocarditis, or pulmonary embolism. It does not have a role in the diagnosis of stable angina if infarction, injury, or strain on the heart is not suspected. ECG exercise stress test {Choice B) is a first-line screening test in the diagnosis of cardiac ischemia from coronary artery disease, but in patients with an ST-segment baseline ECG abnormality {left or right bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, early repolarization, or ventricular aneurysm), it lacks appropriate sensitivity and specificity. Ventilation-perfusion lung scans {Choice D) are used to assess for mismatches in pulmonary ventilation and perfusion and are most commonly used as a second-line study for pulmonary embolus when a contrast enhanced CT angiogram cannot be performed. Coronary angiography {Choice E) is an invasive means of identifying coronary artery disease and is performed through arterial catheterization; it may be required in the diagnosis or treatment of coronary artery disease but would occur following initial noninvasive evaluation in patients not experiencing an acute coronary syndrome. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 41 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 41 . Immediately after undergoing an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and dilatation for achalasia, a 32-year-old woman has moderate substernal and midback pain . She has no history of serious illness . Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min , respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. The abdomen is soft and nondistended . Esophagography shows a small leak of contrast from the distal esophagus into the left chest. In addition to intravenous antibiotic therapy , which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Placement of an intraluminal esophageal stent B) Placement of a left chest tube C) Nissen fundoplication D) Esophagogastrectomy E) Operative repair of the esoRhageal injury Correct Answer: E. The benefits and risks of any procedure must be considered prior to undertaking the procedure. Upper endoscopy is a generally safe procedure, though complications can include bleeding, aspiration, and perforation, and depending on the purpose of the endoscopy, specific complications such as pancreatitis following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can occur. In the case of achalasia, the endoscopy was performed to dilate the narrowed lower esophageal sphincter to promote passage of food. Stretching of smooth muscle, stricture, and connective tissue, especially if chronic inflammation from food bolus impaction led to compromise of the stromal strength of the esophageal wall, can lead to perforation. A perforated esophagus is diagnosed on water-soluble contrast esophagography. An esophageal perforation permits translocation of gastrointestinal contents such as food, stomach acid, and bacteria into the mediastinum, which if untreated, can lead to a fatal mediastinitis infection. Management of esophageal perforation is through antibiotics plus emergent surgical repair.",

A) Administration of chlorambucil B) Administration of heparin C) Thrombopheresis D) Phlebotomy E) Splenectomy CorrectAnswer: D. Polycythemia vera is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder resulting in increased production of all cell lineages (erythrocyte, leukocyte, and thrombocyte) secondary to a JAK2 mutation. It presents with pruritus, especially after hot showers, secondary to increased mast cell production and degranulation. Additionally, it can present with episodic severe, burning pain with red-blue discoloration secondary to blood clot formation in extremity vessels, referred to as erythromelalgia. The marked increase in red blood cell production and hematocrit can lead to the development of hyperviscosity syndrome, which presents with blurred vision and central nervous system symptoms related to vascular congestion. Examination can show splenomegaly and congestion of vessels seen as plethora. Therapeutic phlebotomy results in decreased red blood cell mass and blood volume, which is the best initial treatment for the patient's symptoms. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Administration of chlorambucil (Choice A) is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin disease, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

A) Benign prostatic hy erplasia B) Cauda equina syndrome C) Dementia , Alzheimer type D) Normal-pressure hydrocephalus E) Urinary tract infection Correct Answer: A. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) affects middle-aged and elderly male patients, occurring because of excess growth of tissue in the central prostate causing a lower urinary tract obstruction. BPH presents with urinary dribbling and incontinence, difficulty starting or maintaining a urinary stream, nocturia, the need to frequently urinate, and incomplete voiding. These symptoms are typically insidious in onset, chronic, and progressive. Diagnosis is made on history, physical, and urodynamic testing, along with ruling out alternate diagnoses (eg, prostatic malignancy). Treatment is with supportive care, alpha blockers, 5-a-reductase inhibitors, and/or surgery. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Cauda equina syndrome (Choice B) is caused by compression of the spinal nerve roots comprising the cauda equina. Often, such compression occurs because of malignancy, trauma (eg, compression fractures with fragment retropulsion), disc herniation, spinal stenosis, spinal epidural abscess, or spinal epidural or subdural hematoma. Symptoms include lower extremity numbness, weakness, paralysis, hyporeflexia, perinea! anesthesia, fecal incontinence with poor rectal tone, and overflow incontinence marked by inability to void. Dementia, Alzheimer type (Choice C) may present with urinary symptoms in a behavioral context such as volitional voiding at inappropriate times or in inappropriate locations.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Pain and swelling of joints, morning stiffness, fatigue, mild anemia, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and x-rays showing periarticular osteopenia and erosions is concerning for an inflammatory arthropathy such as rheumatoid arthritis, pseudogout, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or similar rheumatologic or immunologic disorder. Once secondary causes such as disseminated gonococcal arthritis, Lyme disease, and septic arthritis have been excluded, the first-line treatment is generally with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Oral alendronate (Choice A), a bisphosphonate osteoclast inhibitor, is used in the treatment of osteoporosis and hypercalcemia. It does not have a primary role in the management of an inflammatory arthropathy. Oral colchicine (Choice B) is used in the management of gout, pseudogout, and pericarditis. Gout and pseudogout result from deposition of crystals into the joint space, which trigger an intense inflammatory reaction. Symptoms are more often acute, monoarticular, and severe. Diagnosis is via arthrocentesis. Intra-articular injection of methylprednisolone (Choice D) may have a role in the treatment of inflammatory arthritis but would generally occur after a trial of NSAIDs; additionally, this local treatment would require multiple injections, increasing the risk of infection and discomfort to the patient. Intravenous cefazolin (Choice E) would be appropriate in some cases of septic arthritis if a susceptible pathogen were diagnosed; this patient does not clearly have septic arthritis and antibiotics are inappropriate at this time. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 46 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 46 . A 32-year-old woman , gravida 1, para 1, comes to the physician because of spontaneous discharge from her nipples during the past 3 months . She discontinued breast-feeding her child 1 year ago . She takes no medications . Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals . On physical examination , a milky white discharge can be expressed from both nipples. Examination shows no other abnormalities . Her fasting serum prolactin concentration is 40 ng/ml , and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient? A) Application of ice packs to the breasts B) Wearing tight bras C) Bromocriptine theraEJy D) Tamoxifen therapy E) Vitamin E therapy Correct Answer: C. An inappropriate elevation in serum prolactin is defined as hyperprolactinemia and causes production of breast milk and growth of glandular breast tissue. After cessation of breast-feeding, serum prolactin levels typically return to pre-pregnancy levels. Inappropriate elevation of prolactin often arises from a hyperfunctioning anterior pituitary microadenoma and presents with unexpected production of breast milk. Prolactin is negatively regulated by dopamine. Various dopaminergic blocking medications can have galactorrhea as an adverse effect. Further, prolactin is positively regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and in states of hypothyroidism with upregulated TRH, galactorrhea can also occur. With exclusion of the thyroid and any contributions from dopamine antagonists, further diagnostic evaluation should include an MRI of the brain to assess for the presence of a pituitary adenoma. Treatment is with dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine or cabergoline, and if such medications fail or if a macroadenoma is found, surgical resection of the adenoma is required. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Application of ice packs to the breasts (Choice A) and wearing tight bras (Choice B) are recommendations offered to lactating women approaching the end of breast-feeding or for postpartum women who do not wish to pursue breast-feeding. These measures provide relief of discomfort from engorged breast tissue but have no role in treating hormonal dysregulation from pathologic hyperprolactinemia. Tamoxifen therapy (Choice D), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by blocking the trophic action of estrogen on the tumor. It has no role in treating hyperprolactinemia or a pituitary prolactinoma. Vitamin E therapy (Choice E) has been shown to lower prolactin levels in patients with uremia on hemodialysis and has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on pituitary gland hypertrophy; in spite of these findings, it has not been shown to be as effective when compared to dopamine agonists and surgical resection. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 47 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

A 57-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after being involved in a motor vehicle collision. She was the restrained front seat passenger . Her neck was immobilized in a cervical collar at the scene . On arrival , she reports neck pain and pain in her right forearm . Her pulse is 80/min , respirations are 16/min , and blood pressure is 150/70 mm Hg. Examination of the right upper extremity shows swelling and crepitus . She is able to actively extend the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints but not the metacarpophalangeal joints of her right hand or wrist. The remainder of the examination shows no other abnormalities . Plain x-rays show a midshaft fracture of the humerus . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Brachia! plexus injury B) Compartment syndrome C) Herniated cervical disc D) Median nerve injury E) Radial nerve injury Correct Answer: E. The radial nerve courses posterior to the humerus at the midshaft within the radial groove. It is often injured in displaced midshaft humerus fractures, with resulting wrist drop. The radial nerve supplies motor fibers to the triceps brachii and the extensor muscles within the posterior compartment of the forearm and sensory fibers to the dorsum of the forearm, wrist, and hand. It does not innervate the intrinsic muscles of the hand. Injury to the nerve at the mid-diaphyseal humerus causes extensor muscle loss at the hand and wrist, weakness of forearm supination, the presence of wrist drop, and sensory loss over the posterior forearm, dorsum of the hand, and posterior thumb, index, middle, and radial-half of the ring finger. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Brachia! plexus injury (Choice A), depending on the location within the plexus, would involve motor and sensory loss of multiple nerves. A mononeuropathy would be unlikely. Compartment syndrome (Choice B) presents with pain, paresthesia, paresis, poikilothermia, pallor, and pulselessness. It occurs because of increased pressure from swelling or hemorrhage within a fixed-space myofascial compartment. When the pressure approaches or exceeds diastolic blood pressure, blood flow becomes impaired. The compartment and any downstream-supplied structures can become ischemic. With an otherwise normal exam, the localization of the patient's findings to radial nerve injury is much more likely. Herniated cervical disc (Choice C) can occur from traumatic injury and is a known cause of cervical radiculopathy. Usually, one single nerve root is affected, and it commonly presents with pain in a radicular pattern. Weakness of muscles innervated by multiple cervical spinal levels would be less likely outside of catastrophic injury to the cervical spine. Median nerve injury (Choice D) presents with weakness involving the flexor compartment of the forearm, thenar eminence, and first two lumbrical muscles, along with diminished sensation over the anterior forearm and lateral hand. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 49 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Aspiration pneumonia is characterized by fever, cough productive of foul-smelling sputum, malaise, and chest discomfort following an aspiration event; untreated or complicated aspiration pneumonia can lead to the development of a lung abscess, especially with the pathogen Klebsiel/a pneumoniae. Patients at higher risk for aspiration include those with impaired airway-protective reflexes (eg, stroke, myasthenia gravis, depressed mental status), those with frequent or forceful emesis (eg, alcohol use disorder, cyclic vomiting syndrome), or those with abnormal pharyngeal or airway anatomy (eg, malignancy, tracheo-esophageal fistula). These patients are more likely to aspirate gastric contents into the lung, which results in bacterial seeding with gastrointestinal or oral flora and can lead to pneumonia. Frequently, aspiration occurs in a dependent segment of the lung such as bilateral lower lobes when erect or the lingula, right middle lobe, and superior segments of the lower lobes while lying down. Pulmonary abscesses often present with low-grade fevers, weight loss, anemia, and leukocytosis. On chest x-ray, air-fluid levels are seen within the abscess cavity. Treatment is with antibiotics, prevention of recurrent aspiration, and source control with surgical resection or percutaneous drainage. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Aspergillomas (Choice A) are fungal masses that often arise within existing cavitary lesions of the lung, such as those caused by previous infection with tuberculosis or from cavitary squamous cell lung carcinoma. Bronchiectasis (Choice B) is abnormal dilatation of the bronchi that results from recurrent necrotizing infections. Risk factors for bronchiectasis are cystic fibrosis, Kartagener syndrome, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. There are many types of lung cancer (Choice D), such as small cell and non-small cell carcinoma. Lung cancer often presents with hemoptysis and weight loss, but unless a superinfection were present, an air-fluid level would not be expected. Rather, a solitary nodular, mass-like opacity on a chest x-ray or CT would be a more likely presentation. Homeless persons, patients suffering from alcohol use disorder, incarcerated patients, those from endemic areas (eg, Africa, South America), and those living in close contact are more likely to contract tuberculosis (Choice E). Tuberculosis classically presents with fever, night sweats, weight loss, and hemoptysis. The chest x-ray in reactivation tuberculosis classically shows cavitary lesions in the apices of the lung, with possible evidence of a Ghon complex (pulmonary calcified granulomas and hilar adenopathy) from the prior primary tuberculous infection. r-- r \" , r ,",

The patient exhibits a red, scaly rash in his groin (tinea cruris), which is subsequently treated with first line therapy of clotrimazole. The patient also has a similar rash on his left foot (tinea pedis), which was not treated and likely served as a source for autoinfection to other regions of the body, resulting in the patient's recurrent tinea cruris.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Renal artery stenosis is a cause of secondary hypertension related to abnormal stimulation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus secondary to stenosis of the renal artery leading to insufficient afferent blood flow. This results in excessive production of renin and angiotensin. Secondary hypertension should be considered in new-onset or treatment-resistant hypertension. There are two main causes of renal artery stenosis: fibromuscular dysplasia and atherosclerosis. In younger patients, fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause, while older patients develop renal artery stenosis more commonly from atherosclerosis. This patient exhibits a carotid bruit, likely also secondary to atherosclerosis. Diagnosis is established with renal artery Doppler ultrasonography or magnetic resonance angiography. Treatment involves angioplasty or stenting of the stenosed renal artery to improve flow. ACE inhibitors can be considered for unilateral stenosis but can lead to acute end-stage kidney disease in the setting of bilateral renal artery stenosis.",

Coarctation of the aorta (Choice C) is a cause of secondary hypertension related to narrowing of the aorta, although it most commonly presents in childhood with differential blood pressure between upper and lower extremities. It is associated with bicuspid aortic valve and gonadal dysgenesis 45,X (Turner syndrome). Cushing syndrome (Choice D) results from increased cortisol levels and presents with hypertension, moon facies, abdominal striae, osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, and amenorrhea.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Increasing the dose of lisinopril would be the most appropriate recommendation to decrease the patient's risk for renal failure (end-stage kidney disease). Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, which inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme resulting in decreased production of angiotensin II and aldosterone. This results in reduced blood pressure by multiple mechanisms. Additionally, the decreased production of angiotensin II results in relative efferent arteriole dilatation. This leads to decreased glomerular filtration pressure. The patient demonstrates chronic hypertension, which is a leading cause of end-stage kidney disease. Increasing the dose of lisinopril will assist in further decreasing the patient's systemic blood pressure in addition to efferent arteriole dilatation, both of which will reduce intraglomerular pressure. This reduction in intraglomerular pressure will reduce damage to the glomerular capillaries and decrease her risk for end-stage kidney disease. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Protein-restricted diet (Choice A) has been shown to reduce progression of nephropathy in patients with chronic end-stage kidney disease, especially in diabetic nephropathy. This patient's risk for end-stage kidney disease is mostly related to her chronic hypertension for which increasing the dose of lisinopril would demonstrate the most benefit. 24-Hour urine collection for measurement of protein concentration (Choice B) is utilized for the evaluation of nephrotic syndrome and albuminuria for diabetic nephropathy. The patient's nephropathy is likely from chronic hypertension and her urinalysis demonstrates 1+ urine protein, which is a low-level of urine protein. Measurement of 24-hour urine protein would not further assist in her management. Switching from hydrochlorothiazide to furosemide (Choice D) would not appreciably decrease the patient's risk for end-stage kidney disease as these agents do not demonstrate reno-protective properties and are both diuretics. Furosemide is typically used in the management of hypervolemia, while hydrochlorothiazide is a first-line treatment for hypertension management. No further measures are indicated at this time (Choice E) is not the correct answer choice, as the patient's blood pressure remains increased and she would benefit from an increased lisinopril dose to improve her blood pressure and reduce her risk for end-stage kidney disease. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 8 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the next most appropriate step for this patient given its diagnostic and therapeutic function. The patient presents following recurrent episodes of nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, potentially secondary to recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. The CT scan of the abdomen demonstrates a pseudocyst in the pancreatic parenchyma. Pancreatic pseudocysts are a potential complication of acute pancreatitis and are granulation tissue lined collections of simple fluid located in the pancreatic parenchyma or in the peripancreatic region. Pancreatic pseudocysts can result in persistent elevation of serum pancreatic enzymes and recurrent bouts of epigastric abdominal pain. Intervention is indicated for pseudocysts if they are larger than 5 cm or are symptomatic. The first-line intervention for drainage of the pseudocysts is endoscopic by either a transpapillary approach or through creation of a cystogastrostomy or cystoduodenostomy. These result in the creation of drainage pathways between the cyst and gastrointestinal tract. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. HIDA scan (Choice A) is used for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. If there is lack of visualization of the gallbladder after administration of the radioactive tracer, this indicates the presence of acute cholecystitis with blockage of the cystic duct secondary to an impacted, non-mobile gallstone. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (Choice C) alone would not allow for definitive diagnosis and therapeutic intervention of the pseudocyst. Symptomatic pseudocysts larger than 5 cm in diameter require drainage through either a transpapillary approach or cystogastrostomy/cystoduodenostomy. Mesenteric angiography (Choice D) is indicated for definitive evaluation of the mesenteric vessels. This may be performed in the setting of mesenteric ischemia with the goal to localize and treat an obstruction to improve mesenteric blood flow or in the setting of a gastrointestinal bleed, which can be treated with vascular embolization by interventional radiology. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (Choice E) is indicated for visualization of the biliary tree to further delineate findings following ERCP or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or if prior ERCP was unsuccessful in cannulation of the duodenal papilla. Additionally, this technique can be used for therapeutic placement of biliary drains or stents. r-- r \" , r , o Exam Section : Item 1 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Villous atrophy in the small bowel is a characteristic finding of celiac disease. Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy which is mediated through immune intolerance of the protein gliadin, commonly found in wheat products. This results in inflammatory infiltration of the proximal small bowel, which leads to characteristic intraepithelial lymphocytosis, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. Malabsorption of substances in the proximal small bowel ensues, which presents symptomatically as chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, and nutritional deficiencies. Abnormal small bowel absorption results in abnormal serum D-xylose and fecal fat tests. D xylose is absorbed passively in the proximal small bowel; reduced serum D-xylose indicates reduced small bowel mucosal surface area for absorption. The increased concentration of fecal fat indicates intestinal malabsorption of lipids, also seen in the presence of abnormal small bowel mucosa.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Bacterial overgrowth in the small bowel occurs in the setting of impaired intestinal peristalsis, which allows for the uncontrolled growth of bacteria caused by the loss of appropriate peristaltic propulsion. This can result in intestinal malabsorption, diarrhea, bloating, and chronic abdominal pain. The diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth occurs through the hydrogen breath test. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (Choice B) occurs in the setting of chronic pancreatitis, and results in insufficient pancreatic enzyme production and secretion. This leads to inadequate digestion of macromolecules and resultant malnutrition, presenting with diarrhea and steatorrhea. Failure of bile acid excretion (Choice C) and reabsorption (Choice D) would result in the development of steatorrhea secondary to impaired fat digestion and absorption. Cholestasis and structural causes of biliary obstruction can result in impaired bile acid excretion. Bile acids are absorbed in the terminal ileum. Absorption can be impaired by pathologies affecting the terminal ileum, such as Crohn disease. Lactase deficiency (Choice E) results in dietary intolerance to lactose, a carbohydrate found in human and cow milk. Patients present with abdominal cramping, bloating, and diarrhea following ingestion of dairy products. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 11 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 11 . A 77-year-old woman comes to the physician because of palpitations for 2 days. She has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss during the past 6 months. Her temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F) , pulse is 120/min and irregular , respirations are 24/min , and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. Examination shows nontender enlargement of the left lobe of the thyroid gland. Serum studies show a thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration less than 0.05 µU/ml and thyroxine {T concentration of 30 µg/dl . A 1311s tudy shows a single area of increased uptake in the left lobe of the thyroid gland and suppressed uptake elsewhere in the gland . Which of the following is the most likely ) 4 mechanism of these findings? A) Autoimmune destruction of thyroid cells B) Focal granulomatous inflammation C) Parafollicular cell cytokine overproduction D) Production of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin E) Autonomous T !)reduction 4 Correct Answer: E. Autonomous T production is the most likely mechanism for the patient's hyperthyroidism. The patient presents with weight loss, palpitations, and tachycardia, which are typical symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Lab 4 values demonstrate a low thyroid-stimulating hormone {TSH) concentration and increased thyroxine {T concentration. This indicates the patient has primary hyperthyroidism, with the origin of hyperthyroidism likely ) 4 within her thyroid gland. On physical exam, there is a nontender left thyroid lobe enlargement with a single \"hot\" nodule on radioactive iodine uptake {RAIU) scan. These findings are consistent with a toxic adenoma, which autonomously produces thyroxine resulting in clinical hyperthyroidism. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Autoimmune destruction of thyroid cells {Choice A) occurs in the setting of chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder that presents with anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. In the acute phase, chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis can present with hyperthyroidism because of underlying follicular cell damage and release of thyroid hormone, although this would present with diffusely decreased 1-131 uptake on an RAIU scan. Focal granulomatous inflammation {Choice B) refers to subacute {de Quervain) thyroiditis, which is a self-limited thyroiditis that typically presents with tender thyroid enlargement and is associated with flu-like symptoms. Parafollicular cell cytokine overproduction {Choice C) refers to the production of calcitonin by the parafollicular cells, which can be abnormally increased in the setting of medullary thyroid cancer. This would typically not affect thyroid hormone production except in the case of advanced medullary thyroid cancer infiltrating adjacent functional thyroid tissue. This scenario could present with hypothyroidism from insufficient thyroid hormone production. Production of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin {Choice D) occurs in Graves disease which results in primary hyperthyroidism with associated exophthalmos and pretibial myxedema. RAIU typically demonstrates diffuse 1-131 uptake without a focal nodule. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 12 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Chest x-ray is indicated for the evaluation of nontension pneumothorax. The patient presents after rapid ascent during scuba diving, which places him at increased risk for decompression sickness, which can have multiple manifestations. Decompression sickness occurs when dissolved gases precipitate out of solution in the body and form bubbles or when gas expands because of the rapid decrease in ambient pressure. These mechanisms increase the risk for air emboli, arthropathy, tympanic membrane rupture, and pneumothoraces. On physical exam of this patient, there are decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance to percussion in the left hemithorax, which indicates the presence of a pneumothorax. The evaluation for a pneumothorax includes a chest x-ray. Depending on the size of the pneumothorax, the patient may require thoracostomy for appropriate management. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Measurement of serum o-dimer concentration (Choice A) is recommended for evaluation of patients with low pretest probability of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary em bolus. If the o-dimer is increased, the next appropriate step would be ultrasound and Doppler evaluation of the lower extremity veins for a DVT or CT chest angiography for evaluation of a pulmonary embolism. ECG (Choice C) is indicated for evaluation of cardiac arrhythmias and acute coronary syndromes. The patient presents with midchest pain, which is likely secondary to his left-sided pneumothorax, not myocardial ischemia/infarction. The patient does not exhibit any risk factors for an acute coronary syndrome. Echocardiography (Choice D) entails ultrasound evaluation of the heart, allowing for visualization of pericardia! pathology and cardiac morphology, motion, ejection fraction, and valvular function. Lung ultrasound, not cardiac, is useful in the evaluation of pneumothorax. CT scan of the thorax (Choice E) can be performed to evaluate for a variety of thoracic pathology, both acute and chronic. This patient demonstrates physical exam findings concerning for a nontension left-sided pneumothorax, which would be more rapidly evaluated using a chest x-ray rather than CT scan of the chest. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 14 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is an obstructive lung disease characterized by decreased lung function from a combination of features of chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema, resulting in airflow obstruction on expiration. The patient is presenting with a COPD exacerbation, characterized by shortness of breath and shallow respirations. His presentation is likely further exacerbated by the administration of 100% oxygen by face mask, which in a patient with COPD can theoretically result in depression of respiratory drive and further worsening of the ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Depressed ventilation can result in acute hypercarbia, which can lead to an acute decrease in level of consciousness.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Hypoxemia does not likely account for the patient's decreased level of consciousness, as he was treated with 100% oxygen by face mask. This can result in elevation of the patient's oxygen saturation above his normal baseline from underlying COPD, which can theoretically lead to reduced respiratory drive and worsening of the ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Metabolic acidosis (Choice C) can occur in the setting of multiple causes, either with or without an associated anion gap. This patient presents with an acute COPD exacerbation with depressed ventilation, whereas metabolic acidosis is typically followed by increased ventilation via respiratory compensation. Oxygen toxicity (Choice D) can occur after the supplemental administration of high concentration oxygen, which results in overproduction of reactive oxygen species, and can manifest with primarily neurotoxic symptoms such as vision and hearing changes, dizziness, nausea, altered mental status, and convulsions. Respiratory alkalosis (Choice E) occurs in the setting of hyperventilation.

The atrial septal defect results in a left-to-right shunt with abnormal flow of blood from the left atrium to the right atrium, resulting in relative volume overload of the right atrium and ventricle. This increased stroke volume of the right ventricle results in delayed closure of the pulmonic valve, which presents as a fixed, split S and low-grade physiologic ejection murmur on cardiac auscultation.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Labetalol is a first-line antihypertensive medication used to lower blood pressure in the setting of presumed aortic dissection. The patient presents with lower neck pain radiating to her back, hypertensive emergency, and a widened mediastinum on a chest x-ray. These are all findings associated with acute aortic dissection. A CT angiography of the thoracic aorta is indicated to further delineate whether the patient exhibits a type A or B aortic dissection, as this will dictate appropriate management. Regardless of which type of aortic dissection the patient has, it is imperative to appropriately treat the patient's hypertensive emergency. Hypertensive emergency is defined as a blood pressure greater than 180/120 with evidence of end-organ damage (eg, aortic dissection). Intravenous antihypertensive medications should be used for the treatment of hypertensive emergency to appropriately reduce blood pressure and limit progression of end-organ damage. In aortic dissection, to prevent the advancement of the dissection flap and resultant occlusion of branch vessels, the blood pressure should be rapidly reduced using a beta-blocker to lower cardiac output and diminish fluctuations in pulse pressure, combined with an alpha blocker or arterial vasodilator to lower mean 13 arterial pressure by reducing vascular resistance. Labetalol is a nonspecific adrenoreceptor blocker that targets both a - and -adrenoreceptors, making it an ideal choice. 1 1",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Upper endoscopy is the most appropriate next step in management for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERO) resistant to medication therapy and/or with the development of solid food dysphagia. GERO typically presents with burning epigastric and lower chest pain that radiates superiorly and is exacerbated by the ingestion of large meals. First-line therapy for GERO is an empiric trial of proton pump inhibitors or H2 receptor blockers. If the patient demonstrates reflux that is nonresponsive to medication therapy, an upper endoscopy should be performed for definitive evaluation of the esophagus, especially if the patient develops dysphagia. Oysphagia may indicate the development of reflux-associated sequelae such as erosive or eosinophilic esophagitis, Barrett esophagus, or esophageal carcinoma. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, 0, and F. Adding metoclopramide to the medication regimen (Choice A) would not be the best choice, as metoclopramide is a 02 receptor antagonist that increases gastric contractility and motility. It is used primarily for the treatment of gastroparesis and as an antiemetic. It can be used for persistent GERO because of its effect on increasing lower esophageal sphincter tone, but its potentially severe adverse effects (ie, parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia) mean this should only be used for severe, resistant cases of GERO. Adding omeprazole to the medication regimen (Choice B) and switching to famotidine (Choice C) or omeprazole (Choice 0) are not appropriate next steps in management since the patient did not have a response to empiric treatment with the histamine-blocking medication ranitidine and has developed solid food dysphagia. Additionally, no further testing or pharmacotherapy (Choice F) is not appropriate since her GERO did not improve with empiric therapy. Because of her medication-resistant GERO, her esophagus needs to be definitively evaluated for reflux-associated sequelae or alternative culprit lesions. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 24 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Prerenal azotemia refers to an acute kidney injury secondary to decreased renal blood flow, which results in a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), typically in the setting of hypovolemia, hypotension, or renal hypoperfusion. In response to the decreased renal blood flow, renin and angiotensin are upregulated, which stimulates increased absorption of sodium in the proximal convoluted tubule. This leads to decreased fractional excretion of sodium (less than 1% ). The decreased GFR results in decreased tubular flow rate, which consequently leads to increased urea nitrogen reabsorption, although creatinine is unable to be reabsorbed by the renal tubules. This results in an increased serum urea nitrogen (BUN) to serum creatinine (Cr) ratio, typically greater than 20. Treatment of prerenal azotemia requires treatment of the underlying cause of reduced renal blood flow. If untreated, this can progress to worsening acute kidney injury and possible intrinsic renal failure (end-stage kidney disease). lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. Acute glomerulonephritis (Choice A), acute tubular necrosis (Choice B), diabetic nephropathy (Choice C) and interstitial nephritis (Choice D) are all causes of intrinsic renal failure (end-stage kidney disease), which would present with an increased fractional excretion of sodium and a BUN/Cr ratio less than 20, due to underlying tubular dysfunction. Acute glomerulonephritis (Choice A) refers to a variety of glomerular diseases, including nephritic and nephrotic syndromes. Nephritic syndromes typically present with acute end-stage kidney disease with associated hematuria, red blood cell casts, and hypertension. Nephrotic syndrome typically presents with excessive proteinuria (greater than 3 g/day), hyperlipidemia, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Acute tubular necrosis (Choice B) typically occurs following an ischemic or nephrotoxic insult to the kidneys, which results in necrosis of the tubular epithelium. Granular, muddy brown casts are typical on urinalysis. Diabetic nephropathy (Choice C) occurs following nonenzymatic glycosylation of the glomerular basement membrane and efferent arterioles, characteristically presenting as Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions on light microscopy. This progresses over time in patients with diabetes mellitus, initially beginning as microalbuminuria, which can subsequently progress to macroalbuminuria, and then end-stage kidney disease. Interstitial nephritis (Choice D) commonly presents as a hypersensitivity reaction following exposure to certain medications such as penicillin, diuretics, and sulfonamides. It can also occur in the setting of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. It typically presents with pyuria, predominantly eosinophilic. e e e • , • I ., I I I I I • I I I • I .. .. I • 11 .. I II I I I I I I • I .. • I Ii I I II I • I .. I I • • I • I ., .. I • 11 ..

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Obstruction of the small bowel occurs from partial or complete blockage of the small bowel lumen and typically presents with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Partial small bowel obstructions will allow a degree of continued flatus with diminished stooling, and complete obstructions will result in obstipation. Small bowel obstruction (SBO) has many potential causes, although the most common are post-surgical peritoneal adhesions and hernias. On physical exam, SBO typically presents with abdominal tenderness, distention, tympany to percussion, and borborygmi (high-pitched, hyperactive bowel sounds). Potential complications of SBO include bowel rupture and/or necrosis, which can result in sudden-onset peritonitic abdominal signs such as rebound tenderness and guarding. Abdominal x-rays typically demonstrate multiple air-fluid levels in the setting of dilated small bowel loops. Management requires bowel rest and intravenous hydration and sometimes surgical intervention. If the patient has a partial obstruction, the patient should be monitored and provided supportive care. If the patient demonstrates features concerning for a complete obstruction, an exploratory laparotomy should be performed to alleviate the cause of the obstruction. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cardiac abnormality? A) Calcification of a bicuspid aortic valv B) Calcified mitral annulus C) Myxomatous degeneration of the aortic valve D) Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve E) Myxomatous degeneration of the tricuspid valve F) Rheumatic disease of the mitral valve G) Rheumatic disease of the tricuspid valve Correct Answer: A. Calcification of a bicuspid aortic valve can lead to the development of aortic stenosis, which is characterized by a systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur heard best at the right second intercostal space. Bicuspid aortic valves exhibit two leaflets instead of the normal three. It is congenital in nature and can be associated with genetic disorders [e.g., gonadal dysgenesis 45,X (Turner syndrome)]. Bicuspid aortic valves result in altered biomechanics of the valve, increasing the risk for valve degeneration at an earlier age. This valve degeneration results in dystrophic calcification over time, limiting the biomechanics of aortic valve opening, and resulting in aortic stenosis. This degeneration of the valve increases the patient's risk for acute and/or subacute endocarditis, especially after a dental procedure. Additionally, severe aortic stenosis can result in hemolytic anemia from red blood cell lysis as they traverse the valve, which may explain the patient's anemia and hemoglobinuria.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "A calcified mitral annulus involves dystrophic calcification of the fibrous annulus of the mitral valve. This increases the risk for development of mitral stenosis, which is evidenced by a diastolic murmur best heard in the left fourth or fifth intercostal space along the midclavicular line. Myxomatous degeneration of the aortic valve (Choice C), mitral valve (Choice D), and tricuspid valve (Choice E) can be primarily or secondarily related to an underlying connective tissue disorder (eg, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome). Myxomatous degeneration increases the risk for regurgitant murmurs of the involved valve. Rheumatic disease of the mitral valve (Choice F) and tricuspid valve (Choice G) may be acute or chronic in nature. Acute rheumatic heart disease is a sequela from infection with group A streptococci and most commonly affects the mitral valve. Acute rheumatic disease can lead to incompetence of the involved valves and late sequelae of chronic rheumatic disease can result in stenosis of the involved valves. Neither mitral nor tricuspid stenosis would result in a systolic murmur in the right second intercostal space. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 32 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X"

As well, because of the lack of functional a -antitrypsin release into the systemic circulation, there is an imbalance of proteases and anti-proteases in 1 the lung parenchyma, resulting in the destruction of alveolar septa and development of panacinar emphysema. Panacinar emphysema is characterized by emphysematous destructive changes of pulmonary alveolar tissue beginning in bilateral lung bases resulting in bullous changes of the lungs, with the potential to spread diffusely.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Drug-induced neutropenia is an adverse effect of both propylthiouracil and methimazole, which are thioamides used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. The patient exhibits symptoms of hyperthyroidism secondary to Graves disease, including exophthalmos, goiter, and lid lag. Propylthiouracil and methimazole inhibit thyroid peroxidase, while propylthiouracil also inhibits peripheral conversion of T to T by blocking 5'-deiodinase. A 4 3 rare adverse effect of these medications is agranulocytosis, resulting in insufficient production of segmented neutrophils. This results in susceptibility to a variety of infections and increased risk for sepsis in the setting of neutropenic fever. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Autoimmune neutropenia (Choice A) is a rare hematologic disorder characterized by autoantibody-induced destruction of neutrophils. This patient exhibits symptoms of hyperthyroidism for which she received medication therapy and developed the adverse effect of agranulocytosis. Cyclic neutropenia (Choice B) is a rare disease resulting in recurrent episodes of neutropenia, typically every 3 weeks. Patients can also present with symptoms of lethargy, fever, and mucosal ulcerations. Radioactive iodine-induced neutropenia (Choice D) can occur due to myelosuppressive effects of radioactive iodine, although this is rare given the low doses used for the treatment of hyperthyroidism secondary to Graves disease. The patient received medical therapy for her hyperthyroidism, not radioactive iodine therapy. Thyroid storm (Choice E) is a serious potential complication of hyperthyroidism following an acute stress such as trauma or infection. Characteristic presenting symptoms of thyroid storm include fever, diarrhea, tachyarrhythmia, altered mental status (eg, delirium, agitation), and potential coma or death if not emergently treated. Management requires treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, beta-blocker, propylthiouracil, and potassium iodide. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 34 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The left medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) allows for the communication between the right abducens nerve nucleus and left oculomotor nerve nucleus. This allows for the coordinated horizontal movement in the same direction for both eyes. The patient presents with multiple focal neurologic deficits including sensory loss, urinary symptoms, and hyperreflexia. In a younger female, neurologic deficits occurring in separate neurologic pathways over time raises suspicion for multiple sclerosis. The most common lesion affecting the MLF is an inflammatory plaque from multiple sclerosis. A lesion affecting the left MLF would result in impaired left eye adduction during movement of the eyes to the right, due to impaired signal to the left oculomotor nerve nucleus. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Left cerebral hemisphere (Choice A) lesions may result in a variety of neurologic deficits ranging from motor and sensory deficits involving the right side of the body and aphasia, depending on the location of the lesion and the side of the patient's dominant hemisphere. If the lesion involves the left frontal eye fields, the patient would present with conjugate gaze deviation toward the lesion. A lesion within the left paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) (Choice C) would result in conjugate movement of both eyes away from the side of the lesion. For example, a left PPRF lesion would result in conjugate gaze deviation to the right. Right cerebellar hemisphere (Choice D) lesions would result in ipsilateral extremity ataxia, intention tremors, and loss of balance toward the side of the lesion. Right sixth cranial nerve nucleus lesions (Choice E) would result in loss of motor output to the lateral rectus, resulting in a horizontal gaze palsy characterized by medial ipsilateral eye deviation. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 35 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation are the most appropriate initial steps for epiglottitis. Epiglottitis refers to acute infection of the epiglottis. It was commonly caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b prior to widespread pediatric vaccination. Epiglottitis presents with fever and acute severe pharyngitis, drooling, hoarseness, and dysphagia. On lateral neck x-rays, it appears as a \"thumbprint sign.\" Patients typically present in a toxic state and can exhibit rapid respiratory decompensation with the development of strider and airway obstruction. Because of this, first-line therapy is to emergently establish a protected airway through endotracheal intubation. In the setting of epiglottitis, endotracheal intubation should take place in the operating room under direct visualization with a laryngoscope if the patient is stable enough to permit transfer out of the emergency department.",

A) Glomerulonephritis B) Infective endocarditis C) Nephrolithiasis D) Rhabdomyolysis E) Urinary tract infection CorrectAnswer: D. Rhabdomyolysis refers to the abnormal breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue that can occur from multiple causes. The most common causes of rhabdomyolysis are crush/compression injuries such as prolonged immobility, excessive exertion, alcohol abuse, medication, and toxic substances. The breakdown of skeletal muscle myocytes results in release of myoglobin and creatine kinase into the systemic circulation. Increased creatine kinase can be utilized as a marker to evaluate for the presence and progression of rhabdomyolysis. The abnormal release of myoglobin can cause nephrotoxicity, leading to an acute kidney injury from acute tubular necrosis. Treatment of rhabdomyolysis requires supportive care and intravenous fluid hydration, which assists in the renal clearance of myoglobin, limiting its nephrotoxicity.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Choledocholithiasis refers to the presence of a gallstone located within the common bile duct. This can result in varying degrees of obstruction, which dictates the severity of presenting symptoms. Obstructive choledocholithiasis results in colicky right upper quadrant or epigastric pain (biliary colic), nausea, vomiting, and increased direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Direct hyperbilirubinemia can lead to scleral icterus and jaundice. Depending on the location of the common bile duct stone, choledocholithiasis can result in acute pancreatitis, which manifests with epigastric pain and increased pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase). If acute bacterial infection of the biliary tree ensues, this can lead to fever and acute cholangitis. The primary treatment for choledocholithiasis is an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy, followed by cholecystectomy. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Alcoholism (Choice A) is a common cause of acute pancreatitis, which can result in epigastric pain and increased amylase, although would be unlikely to result in direct hyperbilirubinemia. Cholecystitis (Choice B) results from obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone with resultant bacterial infection of the gallbladder, and presents with right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. It would not typically present with increased liver function tests or pancreatic enzymes. Hepatoma (Choice D), also known as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), can present with right upper quadrant tenderness and hepatomegaly with associated hepatic enzyme (AST/ALT) and a-fetoprotein elevation. The main risk factors for HCC are cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B infection. Pancreatic carcinoma (Choice E) often presents with nonspecific symptoms such as chronic abdominal pain radiating to the back, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weight loss. If the pancreatic carcinoma is located in the pancreatic head/neck region, it can result in painless obstructive jaundice. Pancreatic carcinoma would not typically present with acute abdominal pain or increased pancreatic enzymes. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 43 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 43 . A 57-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse is brought to the emergency department by police after she was found lying in the street. On arrival, she does not respond to noxious stimuli. Her temperature is 38.1° C (100 .6°F) , pulse is 124/min , respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 94/60 mm Hg. Examination shows poor skin turgor . The oral mucosa is dry.

A) Acute glomerulonephritis B Acute tubular necrosis C) Allergic interstitial nephritis D) Glomerulosclerosis E) Pyelonephritis Correct Answer: B. Acute tubular necrosis is a cause of intrinsic acute end-stage kidney disease that is most commonly the result of either ischemic or nephrotoxic insults to the kidney. This patient presents after having been found down with hemodynamic instability and signs of hypovolemia. This increases her risk for ischemic injury to the kidneys secondary to decreased renal blood flow, which can lead to tubular epithelial cell death and sloughing into the lumen of the tubules. This typically results in an initial oliguric phase where the patient is at increased risk for uremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. Following this initial phase, the patient will then enter a polyuric recovery phase characterized by excessive urine production with associated falls in creatinine and risk for hypokalemia. Urinalysis typically demonstrates granular, muddy brown casts. The presence of blood and protein in the urine may indicate an additional underlying pathology in this patient, such as rhabdomyolysis from compression necrosis of muscle caused by prolonged pressure against the ground while unconscious. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Acute glomerulonephritis (Choice A) refers to a variety of glomerular diseases, including nephritic and nephrotic syndromes. Nephritic syndromes typically present with acute end-stage kidney disease with associated hematuria, red blood cell urine casts, and hypertension. Nephrotic syndrome typically presents with excessive proteinuria (greater than 3 g/day), hyperlipidemia, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Allergic interstitial nephritis (Choice C) most commonly presents as a hypersensitivity reaction following exposure to certain medications such as penicillin, diuretics, and sulfonamides. It can also occur in the setting of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. It typically presents with pyuria, predominantly eosinophilic. Glomerulosclerosis (Choice D) refers to fibrosis of the glomeruli, which can be seen in a variety of glomerular disease, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and diabetic nephropathy. FSGS is a nephrotic syndrome most commonly caused by sickle cell disease, opioid abuse, and HIV, characterized by segmental sclerosis of the glomeruli. Pyelonephritis (Choice E) typically presents with fevers, nausea, vomiting, and flank pain with associated costovertebral angle tenderness on physical examination.

A 67-year-old man comes to the physician as a new patient to discuss his blood pressure . He brings his medical records , which show a steady increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure over the past 5 years . He takes no medications . He retired from his job as an insurance executive 5 years ago . He is active , exercises three times weekly , and follows a low-cholesterol diet. His blood pressure today is 160/86 mm Hg. Examination shows no other abnormalities . Which of the following is the most critical factor in the etiology of this patient's hypertension? A) Decreased diameter of the vascular lumen B) Decreased vascular coml)liance C) Increased deposition of lipids in arterial smooth muscle D) Increased deposition of lipofuscin in cardiac myocytes E) Increased intimal thickening of the arteries Correct Answer: B. Decreased vascular compliance is the most critical factor in the cause of this patient's hypertension. The patient demonstrates an increased systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg and pulse pressure of 7 4 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure of 86 mm Hg is at the upper limit of normal. Increased pulse pressure can occur in the setting of various pathologies, including aortic regurgitation, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperthyroidism, and decreased aortic compliance. Vascular compliance refers to the association between changes in blood volume and pressure, with a decreased compliance resulting in abnormally increased pressure relative to changes in volume. Atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta result in decreased aortic compliance and are commonly associated with modifiable risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, smoking, and diabetes mellitus, along with nonmodifiable risk factors such as male sex and increased age. This decreased aortic compliance results in hypertension primarily with isolated systolic blood pressure elevation and is commonly seen in older persons. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Decreased diameter of the vascular lumen (Choice A) would result in increased systemic vascular resistance, most commonly associated with cholesterol atheroma buildup (atherosclerosis) resulting in increased intimal thickening of the arteries (Choice E), especially the arterioles. Decreased vascular lumen diameter would also be seen with increased deposition of lipids in the arterial smooth muscle (Choice C). These would result primarily in an elevation of diastolic blood pressure. Increased deposition of lipofuscin in cardiac myocytes (Choice D) is associated with normal aging and would not directly result in progressive hypertension unless concomitant heart failure was also present. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 45 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 45 . A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She feels well and has no history of serious illness. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years and drinks two beers daily. She has a sedentary lifestyle . Her mother underwent bilateral knee replacement at the age of 55 years for severe osteoarthritis . The patient is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 101 kg (223 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m 2 Her pulse • is 64/min , respirations are 18/min , and blood pressure is 148/92 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities . She requests advice about how to prevent osteoarthritis . Which of the following is most likely to decrease this patient's risk for osteoarthritis? A) Abstinence from alcohol B) Regular aerobic exercise C) Weight loss D) Calcium supplementation E) Estrogen replacement therapy at the onset of menopause Correct Answer: C. Weight loss is the most likely modifiable risk factor to decrease this patient's risk for osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a noninflammatory arthropathy secondary to deterioration of articular cartilage, often related to multifactorial causes with an interplay of systemic and local factors. Obesity, defined as a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m 2 is one of the most common risk factors for the development of osteoarthritis. Excess weight results in consistent, increased daily joint stress and degradation of the articular cartilage. Further, humeral factors from adipose cells plus leptin system derangements cause alterations in metabolism of articular cartilage. These factors result in an increased rate of degradation. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Abstinence from alcohol (Choice A) does not directly affect the risk for developing osteoarthritis. Excessive consumption of alcohol does increase the risk for osteoporosis and increases the risk for a patient to become overweight or obese, but it does not itself increase osteoarthritis risk. Regular aerobic exercise (Choice B) does not demonstrate supporting evidence of increased osteoarthritis risk when performed at light to moderate activity levels and with normal joints. While it can indirectly result in decreased osteoarthritis risk through improved fitness levels and weight loss, it does not directly decrease the risk for osteoarthritis. Calcium supplementation (Choice D) and estrogen replacement therapy at the onset of menopause (Choice E) would assist in decreasing the risk for osseous demineralization and osteoporosis development but would not play a role in decreasing the risk for osteoarthritis. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 46 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 46 . A 42-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of the sudden onset of worsening headache and left-sided weakness 1 hour ago . He has no history of serious illness and has not seen a physician for 10 years . He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years and drinks six beers daily. He is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 97 kg (215 lb); BMI is 30 kg/m 2 His pulse is 80/min , and blood pressure is 180/120 mm Hg. • Examination shows mild-to-moderate weakness of the left lower aspect of the face. Muscle strength is decreased in the left upper and left lower extremities . Funduscopic examination shows an arteriovenous ratio of 1 :3 and regions of mild focal spasm of some arterioles. Results of a complete blood count , platelet count, and coagulation studies are within the reference ranges. His serum total cholesterol concentration is 400 mg/dl. A CT scan of the head shows a 1.5 2-cm region of hyperintensity centered at the right putamen ; there is mild surrounding lucency. Which of the following is most likely to decrease this patient's risk for a recurrent stroke of this type? x A) Alcohol cessation B) Smoking cessation C) Weight loss D) Atorvastatin therapy E) Clopidogrel therapy F) Lisinopril therapy Correct Answer: F. Lisinopril therapy is an ACE inhibitor antihypertension medication, which would be the most likely intervention to reduce this patient's risk for recurrent hypertension-associated intraparenchymal hemorrhagic stroke. The patient presents with progressively worsening headache and a focal neurologic deficit, characteristic for an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Emergent noncontrast CT of the head is indicated for evaluation, which in this patient demonstrates a region of hyperdensity in the right putamen, consistent with an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The greatest risk factor for an intraparenchymal hemorrhage is poorly or uncontrolled hypertension. Hypertension most commonly results in hemorrhages within the basal ganglia, cerebellum, thalamus, and/or pons. Initiation of antihypertensive therapy to reduce the patient's blood pressure would decrease his risk for recurrent hemorrhagic stroke.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "D": "Atorvastatin therapy would assist in decreasing the patient's cholesterol, although this would primarily decrease risk for an ischemic stroke, not recurrent hemorrhagic stroke. Clopidogrel therapy (Choice E) would be contraindicated in a patient with a history of hemorrhagic stroke as clopidogrel is an antiplatelet medication that would increase the patient's risk for hemorrhage. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 47 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 47 . A 32-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the physician because of irregular menses for 3 years . Menses occur at 35- to 60-day intervals . Menses previously occurred at regular 28-day intervals . Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago . She has no history of serious illness but has been overweight most of her adult life. She is sexually active with her husband of 3 years and uses condoms consistently . She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 77 kg (170 lb); BMI is 29 kg/m 2 Her blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows moderate coarse hair over the upper lip, chin, and abdomen . Abdominal and pelvic examinations show no abnormalities . Serum • studies show a thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration of 4 µU/ml , 13-hCG concentration of less than 2 mlU/mL , and prolactin concentration of 18 ng/ml . Pelvic ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. In addition to recommending weight loss, which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? A) Oral contraceptive therapy B) Oral medroxyprogesterone therapy C) Oral prednisone therapy D) Oral thyroid therapy E) Depot leuprolide injection Correct Answer: A. Oral contraceptive therapy is the first-line therapy for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in patients who are not attempting to conceive. The patient presents with irregular menses, hirsutism, and increased body weight, without abnormal thyroid or prolactin lab values. This is characteristic for PCOS. PCOS demonstrates excess androgens and can present with polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, oligo/anovulation, or clinical/biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, of which two are required for the diagnosis. The patient demonstrates a normal pelvic ultrasound, although delineation of polycystic ovaries is not required since she exhibits signs of oligo/anovulation and hyperandrogenism. PCOS increases the risk for metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. For patients who are not attempting to conceive, first-line therapy consists of weight loss and treatment with a combination of oral contraceptives and/or metforrnin. If the patient is attempting to conceive, therapy should include weight loss, clomiphene (to improve successful ovulation), and/or metformin. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Oral medroxyprogesterone therapy (Choice B) is a type of contraceptive consisting of only progestin. Progestin administration would not improve the patient's anovulation, which requires the combination effects of estrogen and progestin in oral contraceptives. Additionally, adverse effects of medroxyprogesterone include weight gain and irregular periods, which would not improve the patient's PCOS symptoms. Oral prednisone therapy (Choice C) and oral thyroid therapy (Choice D) are not indicated in the treatment of PCOS. Oral prednisone is indicated in a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, although in this patient the adverse effects of weight gain and metabolic syndrome would be deleterious. Oral thyroid therapy is not indicated given the patient's normal TSH concentration, indicating she is euthyroid. Depot leuprolide injection (Choice E) is a GnRH analog, which serves to downregulate GnRH receptors in the pituitary and results in decreased production of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. Leuprolide is utilized for the treatment of a variety of conditions, including precocious puberty, infertility, and endometriosis. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 48 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 48 . A 57-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after a 3-minute episode of unconsciousness . The patient says that the episode began with an impending sense of feeling ill while watching television . He quickly became confused , swayed in his chair, and fell to the floor. He had no bowel or bladder incontinence during this episode. His mental status spontaneously recovered fully within 3 minutes . He has a 10-year history of hypertension well controlled with hydrochlorothiazide . He had a myocardial infarction 4 years ago . He is 183 cm (6 ft) tall and weighs 95 kg (210 lb); BMI is 29 kg/m 2 His pulse is 86/min , respirations are 12/min , and blood pressure is 124/86 mm Hg. Neurologic and cardiac examinations show normal findings . An ECG shows Q waves in leads 11 , 111 , and aVF. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings? A) Hypoglycemia B) Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia C) Pulmonary embolus D) Seizure E) Transient ischemic attack Correct Answer: B. Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia (VT) refers to the sudden onset of VT, defined as three or more consecutive premature ventricular contractions. This results in a wide QRS complex tachyarrhythmia. Risk factors include underlying structural heart disease, history of coronary artery disease, or myocardial infarction. Nonsustained VT lasts for less than 30 seconds, while sustained VT persists longer than 30 seconds and presents with varying symptoms such as palpitations and syncope. While an episode of VT may be transient, if sustained, it may require treatment with anti-arrhythmic medications or cardioversion. Class one or three antiarrhythmics are the frequent first-line therapy for stable, sustained VT. Synchronized cardioversion may be necessary in cases of unstable, sustained VT, and defibrillation is required for pulseless VT. Syncope in the setting of VT typically persists for the duration of the episode. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E.",
        "A": "Hypoglycemia is a common cause of syncope, most often in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or an underlying insulinoma. Syncope secondary to hypoglycemia requires treatment with dextrose and/or glucagon and would not be expected to spontaneously resolve without treatment. Additionally, the patient does not exhibit risk factors for hypoglycemia, and given his cardiac risk factors, arrhythmogenic syncope is more likely. Pulmonary embolus (PE) (Choice C) can result in syncope in the setting of a massive PE, which would present with tachycardia and hypotension, with possible right heart strain signs on ECG (eg, \"S1Q3T3\" pattern).",
        "E": "Transient ischemic attack is defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without infarction. Transient ischemic attack resulting in syncope does not typically present with a postictal state. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 49 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment X 49 .

Treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin initially improved his symptoms . He has not had fever for the past 2 days . He has type 2 diabetes mellitus . His current medications are ceftriaxone , heparin , omeprazole , and insulin glargine . A peripheral catheter is in place ; there is no central access. Vital signs are within normal limits . Examination of the skin shows no lesions . On pulmonary examination , rhonchi are heard in the left upper lobe . Laboratory studies show: Days Day? Hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL 10 g/dL Leukocyte count 11 ,500/mm 3 12,000/mm 3 Platelet count 330 ,000/mm 3 90,000/mm 3 Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Add epoetin alfa to the medication regimen B) Discontinue ceftriaxone and begin physical therapy C) Switch from ceftriaxone to piperacillin and tazobactam therapy D) Switch from he arin to direct thrombin inhibitor therapy E) Switch from heparin to low-molecular-weight heparin therapy CorrectAnswer: D. Switch from heparin to direct thrombin inhibitor therapy is indicated for the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT typically occurs between 5 and 10 days after the initiation of heparin therapy. It results from the development of lgG antibodies against the complex of heparin and platelet factor 4. This complex leads to the activation of platelets, which can cause thrombosis, typically venous, and consumption of platelets. This abnormal activation yields progressively decreasing platelet counts, which typically hit their lowest point at greater than 50% from their initial level. Treatment requires cessation of all heparin-related products (eg, unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin). The patient should be transitioned to a direct thrombin inhibitor or direct factor Xa inhibitor to ensure adequate anticoagulation without worsening the thrombocytopenia. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Add epoetin alfa to the medication regimen (Choice A) would result in increased red blood cell production from the bone marrow, not platelet production. Epoetin alfa is an analog of erythropoietin (EPO). This is commonly utilized in the setting of chronic end-stage kidney disease for the treatment of normocytic anemia from impaired EPO production. Discontinue ceftriaxone and begin physical therapy (Choice B) is not the best option as ceftriaxone is necessary to treat her pneumonia, and it is less likely to cause thrombocytopenia than heparin over this abrupt time course. Switch from ceftriaxone to piperacillin and tazobactam therapy (Choice C) would only be indicated if the patient developed a hospital or ventilator-associated pneumonia, for which broad-spectrum antibiotics are necessary. Rather, this patient presents with community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Ceftriaxone and azithromycin are first-line therapies for CAP. Switch from heparin to low-molecular-weight heparin therapy (Choice E) would cause further worsening of the patient's HIT, as low-molecular-weight heparin is a subtype of heparin and would further propagate the antibody complex formation and activation of platelets. Instead , the patient requires transition to a direct thrombin inhibitor or factor Xa inhibitor for anticoagulation. r-- r \" , r , Answer - explanation not available on NBME website."

Primary immunodeficiencies may result from abnormalities of acquired immunity (B-cell , T-cell), innate immunity, or combined dysfunction. Specifically, a decreased, absent, or aberrant production of immunoglobulin by B-cells can result in recurrent sinopulmonary infections, leading to multiple recurrent sinus infections and pneumonia, which this patient demonstrates . These recurrent pulmonary infections can lead to the development of bronchiectasis over time . For further differentiation of the patient's primary immunodeficiency, quantitative immunoglobulin testing should be performed to delineate the patient's immunologic pathophysiology. B-cell disorders include such diseases as X-linked agammaglobulinemia, selective lgA deficiency, and common variable immunodeficiency .

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by diffusely low bone density. Evaluation for osteoporosis occurs through performance of a DEXA scan and is defined as a bone mineral density less than 2.5 standard deviations compared to a young, normal population (T-score). The most common risk factors for the development of osteoporosis are age, smoking, chronic inflammatory disease , corticosteroid use, and estrogen-depleting conditions in women. Osteoporosis is often asymptomatic but increases the risk for fractures, most commonly involving the hip, vertebrae, and distal radius. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation are the first line for treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. Reduction of active osteoporotic risk factors should also be pursued . Weight-bearing exercises are recommended to slow deterioration of bone mineral density. Bisphosphonates (eg, alendronate) inhibit osteoclast activity. They are utilized once an individual is diagnosed with osteoporosis to reduce further loss of bone mineral density.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Calcitonin is a native hormone which inhibits osteoclast activity and reabsorption of calcium within the renal tubules . It is rarely used for the treatment of osteoporosis given its cost and side effect profile, but can be used in the setting of severe, symptomatic hypercalcemia. Estrogen (Choice C) does result in positive bony remodeling, which would in theory lead to increased bone mineral density, although administration of estrogen results in a significantly increased risk for the development of life-threatening venous thrombosis. lsoflavones (Choice D) are postulated to improve postmenopausal symptoms and delay osteoporosis, although there is currently insufficient data on their effectiveness and safety. Raloxifene (Choice E) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator, which acts as an agonist for positive bony remodeling from increased osteoblast activity. It is useful in the prevention of osteoporosis, but due to off-target effects is generally third line following bisphosphonates. ,. \"' , r-- ,. , Exam Section : Item 4 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (Choice C) presents most commonly in younger, overweight females taking vitamin A, oral contraceptives, or danazol. It is usually associated with a holocephalic headache and blurry vision. Meningitis (Choice D) classically presents with an acute headache, fever, photophobia, and neck stiffness, with variable etiologies from bacterial, viral, or fungal sources. Leukocytes would be elevated on cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Migraine headaches (Choice E) characteristically recur over time and may present with a pulsatile, unilateral, or bilateral headache with associated photophobia or phonophobia. They are often triggered by foods, medications, noises, menses, or illness. ,. \"' , r-- r ,,, Exam Section : Item 8 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Valvular insufficiency is a common complication of deep venous thrombosis. As a thrombus occludes the cross-sectional area of a deep vein, the valves, which originate from the walls of the veins, become involved in the thrombus either through compression against the wall of the vessel or through incorporation into the thrombus during propagation. When the thrombus resolves, the residual valve may be dysfunctional from damage to the leaflets, annulus, or diameter of the native vessel. This prevents the valve from functioning effectively and results in retrograde venous flow secondary to gravity. Inadequate venous drainage of the lower extremities can result in varicose veins, chronic edema, and stasis dermatitis.",

        "A": "Cellulitis is characterized by inflammation in the skin and demonstrates erythema, induration, warmth, and edema . Most commonly, it is acute and results from a bacterial infection of the skin . Obstruction of the iliac vein (Choice B) would present with edema of the entire left lower extremity as opposed to the calf in isolation . Further, the patient's ultrasound was normal, without evidence of an obstruction. On duplex ultrasound, the iliac vessels would not necessarily be visualized, although doppler venous waveforms can suggest a proximal obstruction if present. Obstruction of lymph channels (Choice C) results in nonpitting edema of the affected extremity, though would be less likely given the patient's anatomically correlated history of a deep venous thrombosis and lack of infectious (eg, filariasis), surgical, malignant, or traumatic history to explain injury to the lymphatic system. Saphenous vein reflux (Choice D) could explain lower extremity edema and varicose vein development; however, it is a superficial vein and this patient has no known history of thrombosis or structural damage to it. ,. \"' , r-- ,. , Exam Section : Item 9 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

It is frequently seen in patients with poorly controlled diabetes and immunocompromised states. Classically, it presents with external ear pain exacerbated with movement of the tragus or pinna, purulent discharge, and an edematous/erythematous external ear canal often containing granulation tissue. When the infection is severe and has infiltrated outside the external ear canal causing extensive tissue destruction, it is termed necrotizing (or malignant) otitis externa, which requires treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Otitis externa is not always necrotizing. The non-necrotizing variant is commonly known as \"swimmer's ear,\" and presents with mild external ear pain, watery discharge, swelling, and erythema of the external acoustic meatus. Treatment of non-necrotizing otitis externa consists of adequately cleaning the ear, acidifying the canal, and administering fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin) ear drops.",

The most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a parathyroid adenoma, with parathyroid hyperplasia and carcinoma additional possibilities. Common symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism are secondary to the patient's resultant hypercalcemia and include recurrent nephrolithiasis, bone pain from osseous resorption, polyuria, dehydration, constipation, and psychiatric disturbances. Polyuria and associated volume depletion are secondary to the direct effects of hypercalcemia on the kidney, which results in renal resistance and lack of response to anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), known as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The resistance to ADH results in insufficient aquaporin expression in the collecting tubules of renal nephrons, leading to increased urine volume, which manifests clinically as polyuria and volume depletion.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Allergic interstitial nephritis results in pyuria (predominantly eosinophils) and azotemia often related to the use of certain classes of medications such as diuretics, penicillins, proton pump inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and sulfonamides. Central diabetes insipidus (Choice B) results in polyuria and volume depletion secondary to insufficient production of ADH from a brain injury or lesion. Chronic pyelonephritis (Choice C) often occurs in patients prone to recurrent episodes of acute pyelonephritis, with risk factors such as chronic obstructing renal stones or vesicoureteral reflux. Glycosuria (Choice D) refers to glucose in the urine, often in patients with hyperglycemia secondary to diabetes mellitus. Hypertensive nephropathy (Choice E) is a common cause of chronic renal failure, resulting from glomerular damage from chronic hypertension. ,. \"' , r-- r ,,, Medicine Self-Assessment 11 . A 67-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital because of a 1-day history of fever and severe abdominal pain. His only medication is glyburide . His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Abdominal examination shows moderate left lower quadrant tenderness with guarding but no rebound. His serum creatinine concentration is 1.4 mg/dl. Urinalysis shows no abnormalities . This patient should receive which of the following prior to a CT scan of the abdomen with intravenous contrast? Atrial natriuretic peptide Dopamine Furosemide Mannitol 0.9% Saline Correct Answer: E. Contrast-induced nephropathy {CIN) results from the toxic effect of intravenous contrast on the tubular cells of the kidney and may result in impaired renal function. This patient presents with a fever and abdominal pain and will require a contrast-enhanced CT scan to further assess the etiology. His creatinine is elevated, which may place him at a higher risk for the development of CIN. To prevent or decrease the patient's risk of CIN, he should receive an intravenous 0.9% saline infusion. Intravenous isotonic fluid administration assists in promoting renal excretion and reducing nephrotoxic effects of iodinated contrast. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Atrial natriuretic peptide (Choice A) may promote diuresis though has not been shown to prevent CIN. Dopamine (Choice B) is considered a nephroprotective inotrope. At low concentrations, it can theoretically increase renal blood flow. It does not have a role in preventing CIN . Furosemide (Choice C) is a loop diuretic, which would result in increased urine production. Loop diuretics had been shown to reduce the risk of CIN when used in conjunction with matched intravenous fluid hydration. Loop diuretics should not be used as a sole preventative measure for CIN as the diuretic may result in hemodynamically significant hypovolemia which could worsen any contrast-associated acute kidney injury. Mannitol (Choice D) is an osmotic diuretic most commonly used to lower intracranial and intraocular pressure in acute elevations. Forced diuresis with mannitol is not currently recommended for the prevention of CIN. ,. \"' , r-- ,. , Medicine Self-Assessment"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cushing syndrome is characterized by excess production of cortisol. This results in symptoms such as oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, weight gain, skin changes, osteoporosis, and hyperglycemia. Non-suppression of cortisol on overnight dexamethasone suppression test is diagnostic of Cushing syndrome . There are multiple potential etiologies of Cushing syndrome, including pituitary adenoma, adrenal tumor, or ectopic paraneoplastic ACTH secretion (eg, small-cell lung cancer). Along with the increased production of cortisol, Cushing syndrome from an adrenal etiology can also result in increased concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) produced within the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex. Elevated DHEA-S can also occur in the setting of adrenocortical carcinoma and adrenal hyperplasia. Given the increased DHEA-S , the likely etiology is localized to the adrenal gland. To further assess the patient's pathologic production of cortisol, a CT scan of the abdomen would be the next best step in management to investigate the presence of a functional adrenal nodule or hyperplasia.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Fasting serum cortisol concentration would be inaccurate for the evaluation and diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. Serum potassium concentration (Choice B) is variable in the setting of Cushing syndrome and may be within normal limits or mildly decreased. This is secondary to cortisol's mild affinity for mineralocorticoid receptors (eg, aldosterone) in the kidney, resulting in increased excretion of potassium in the urine. The patient's irregular menses are explained by excessive cortisol and DHEA-S from Cushing syndrome, which does not require ultrasound of the pelvis for further investigation (Choice C), as the etiology is likely secondary to an adrenal process in this instance . MRI of the brain (Choice E) is useful for evaluation of intracranial pathology, including pituitary adenomas. Given the patient's elevated DHEA-S, the etiology for the patient's elevated cortisol is likely within the adrenal gland, not the pituitary gland . ,. \"' , r-- r ,,, Medicine Self-Assessment"

It is most common in African American females and is often asymptomatic except for lymphadenopathy, with radiographs potentially demonstrating bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and reticulonodular opacities of bilateral lungs. Granulomatous inflammation can result in autonomous production of 1-alpha-hydroxylase , which converts 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 to the active form 1,25- dihydroxy-vitamin D3.

On echocardiography, the patient has a reduced ejection fraction, indicative of systolic heart failure. On physical exam, there is an S gallop with evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy on 4 electrocardiogram , which indicates diastolic heart failure. Additionally, his chest x-ray demonstrates evidence of pulmonary edema (eg, Kerley B lines), a consequence of left-sided heart failure.

This ECG shows an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The inferior wall of the heart and the atrioventricular (AV) node often share a common blood supply from the right coronary artery (RCA). When the RCA is blocked, infarction of both the inferior wall and the AV node can occur, which can lead to an AV block with a junctional escape rhythm. In normal sinus rhythm, there is a one-to-one relationship between the P wave and QRS complex, which is not seen in the setting of complete heart block. In fact, there is no relationship between the P and QRS frequencies, with each maintaining its own unique, separate rate per minute. This ECG shows an escape rhythm; the R-R interval is constant and the QRS complex is narrow suggesting a pacer focus located in the common bundle or just distal to the AV node within the His-Purkinje system.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "A lesion within the spinal cord can result in injury to a single or multiple spinal cord tracts. This can lead to asymmetric physical exam findings depending on the location of the lesion. Fine touch (pinprick) and temperature are transmitted by the anterolateral spinothalamic (ALS) tract. Motor function is carried along the lateral corticospinal tract (CST). Sensation of vibration and proprioception are transmitted along the dorsal columns-medial lemniscus pathway (DC-ML). A lesion located within the anterior and lateral fascicles of the spinal cord white matter would result in injury to the ALS tract and lateral CST. This would result in contralateral loss of fine touch and temperature perception since the primary sensory neuron for the ALS tract decussates within the spinal cord along the ventral white commissure, followed by ascent within the anterolateral tract of the spinal cord. Additionally, there would be findings of ipsilateral motor weakness as motor decussation occurs in the brain stem. With injury to the lateral CST, the patient would manifest upper motoneuron exam findings such as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski sign.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Lesions within the brain stem typically result in ipsilateral loss of cranial nerve function (variable depending on the location within the brain stem) and contralateral loss of long-tract spinal cord function (ie, CST, ALS , or DC-ML) . For example, a lesion within the lateral medulla results in Wallenberg syndrome , manifesting with ipsilateral loss of sensation to the face and contralateral body, along with additional cranial nerve symptomatology such as dysphagia, hoarseness, and decreased gag reflex . A lesion within the cerebral hemisphere (Choice B) would result in a contralateral focal neurologic deficit dependent on the location of the lesion. Lesions within the cerebral hemisphere do not result in bilateral asymmetric neurologic exam findings. Peripheral nerve lesions (Choice C) result in symptoms (lower motoneuron weakness, paresthesias, and numbness) within a specific dermatome or peripheral nerve distribution (eg, radial nerve). Conversion reaction (Choice E), also referred to as functional neurologic symptom disorder, can result in loss of motor or sensory function that cannot be explained by a physical illness or injury.

Acutely increased blood pressure can result in end-organ damage to the kidney secondary to glomerular and arteriolar injury, which can sometimes be worsened by abrupt antihypertensive therapy.

The severity of asthma is graded based on frequency of day- and night-time symptomatic episodes. Intermittent asthma is characterized as symptoms occurring S2 days per week and S2 nights per month and requires as needed short-acting bronchodilators for symptomatic relief. Individuals with mild persistent asthma (such as this patient) exhibit symptoms >2 days per week or >2 nights per month, which requires the addition of daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (eg, fluticasone). Moderate persistent asthma is treated with the addition of long-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists (eg, salmeterol) to the regimen of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and as-needed short acting bronchodilator.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma most commonly occurs in the pancreatic head. It is often initially characterized by nonspecific vague abdominal discomfort or weight loss. As the pancreatic mass increases in size, it can lead to the obstruction and dilation of both the common bile duct and main pancreatic duct, referred to as a double-duct sign on ultrasound. This can result in painless jaundice and/or pancreatitis from obstruction of these ducts. If the pancreatic adenocarcinoma continues to spread and results in infiltration of surround ing abdominal viscera and/or encasement of adjacent neurovascular structures, this can manifest with severe abdominal pain. The nonspecific nature of pancreatic adenocarcinoma's early symptoms creates a diagnostic dilemma , as many benign conditions present similarly. It is frequently asymptomatic until it creates an obstruction, gastrointestinal dysfunction, perineural or vascular encasement/invasion, or metastatic disease .",

Sclerosing cholangitis (Choice D) presents either primarily or in patients with a history of ulcerative colitis. It presents as inflammation and chronic fibrosis of the biliary tree resulting in a beaded appearance to the biliary tree with multifocal strictures . Symptoms of sclerosing cholangitis include anorexia, nausea , vomiting, and malabsorption.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Pulmonary tuberculosis can present in various stages. Primary tuberculosis results from an initial exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, leading to the development of hilar lymphadenopathy and a Ghon focus (Ghon complex). Reactivation tuberculosis (secondary) typically results in apical pulmonary opacity with fibrocaseous cavitary lesions. This may present clinically with prolonged fever, night sweats, weight loss (including skeletal muscle wasting), and hemoptysis. A PPD skin test can be negative in the setting of tuberculosis infection if the patient is immunocompromised. Reactivation tuberculosis requires combination anti-microbial treatment including rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, along with initial respiratory isolation.",

It commonly presents with cough and fever following an aspiration episode, with consolidation most commonly occurring in the dependent portions of the right middle or lower lobes. Bronchiectasis (Choice B) refers to chronic dilation of the bronchi and/or bronchioles as a result of chronic necrotizing infection, most commonly related to chronic bronchial obstruction, cystic fibrosis, Kartagener syndrome, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Sarcoidosis (Choice C) is a chronic non-caseating granulomatous systemic inflammatory condition, which most commonly affects the hilar lymph nodes and lungs . Pulmonary sarcoidosis can result in coarse reticular pulmonary opacities, which may progress to a restrictive lung disease from interstitial fibrosis, although acute fever and hemoptysis would be rare. Septic pulmonary emboli (Choice D) typically occur in the setting of endocarditis (eg, tricuspid valve) or infected sources of thromboemboli (eg, Lemierre syndrome) . Wegener granulomatosis (Choice F) can result in multifocal cavitary pulmonary nodules, but typically also occurs in the setting of upper respiratory tract symptoms (eg , perforated nasal septum, chronic sinusitis) and glomerulonephritis (eg, hematuria). r , ,.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Delirium tremens B Heat stroke 1 C) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome D) Subarachnoid hemorrhage E) Thyroid storm F) Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome Correct Answer: B. Heat stroke is characterized by hyperthermia, altered mental status or neurologic deficits, and variable physical signs and symptoms depending on severity. In this case, this patient was found down, in a hot apartment, presumably from the combined effects of alcohol intoxication and subsequent overheating from the environment. His exam shows tachycardia, hypotension, and warm, flushed skin. His workup reveals hypernatremia, hyperchloremia, hyperkalemia, elevated creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and elevated creatine kinase. This constellation of findings reflects hyperthermia, severe hypovolemia, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, E, and F. Delirium tremens {Choice A) occurs 48-72 hours following cessation of alcohol use in a patient with alcoholism and is characterized by delirium, hallucinations, and autonomic instability. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome {Choice C) occurs secondary to certain classes of medications, such as antipsychotics, and is characterized by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and autonomic instability. Subarachnoid hemorrhage {Choice D) typically presents with an acute-onset, severe headache, and is shown on imaging as hyperdense material {blood) within the subarachnoid space. Thyroid storm {Choice E) presents with hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, diaphoresis, agitation, tremor, nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss, and may progress to high-output heart failure, obtundation, seizure, or coma. It typically occurs in a patient with a known diagnosis of hyperthyroidism following a secondary insult such as infection or physiologic stress from surgery or trauma. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome {Choice F) occurs secondary to thiamine deficiency and is characterized by neurologic symptoms, including confusion, nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia, followed by dementia and psychosis. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 41 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment 41 .

He has a history of \"abnormal liver tests\" and condylomata acuminata . He has had multiple sexual partners during the past 10 years and does not use condoms .

There is no crepitus or fluctuance . Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities . Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 18,000/mm 3 with a left shift . X-rays of the left hand show diffuse soft-tissue edema . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Brown recluse spider bite B) Disseminated gonococcal infection C) Erysipelas D) Fasciitis E) Gout F) LymRhangitis G) Sporotrichosis Correct Answer: F. Lymphangitis refers to inflammation or infection of the lymphatic channels, which often occurs secondary to an infectious source at a location distal to the lymphatic channel, in this case correlating with the location of the patient's burns. The most common cause of lymphangitis is Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A), with Sporothrix schenckii representing the most common fungal lymphangitis. Clinically, it presents with erythema in a linear, longitudinal band appearance, which correlates with the associated lymphatic drainage channel. There is also typically painful lymphadenopathy along the associated lymphatic drainage channel. This can result in pain and swelling with the possibility for high fevers. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, E, and G. Brown recluse spider bites {Choice A) are associated with dermatonecrosis due to cytotoxic venom. Systemic illness is possible, more common in children, elderly, and chronically ill individuals, which can manifest with fever, rashes, and myalgias, and rarely, disseminated intravascular coagulation and end-organ damage. Disseminated gonococcal infection {Choice B) presents with pustular skin lesions, migratory polyarthralgia, and tenosynovitis. Erysipelas {Choice C) results from infection of the upper dermis and superficial lymphatics, most commonly from S. pyogenes, and on exam appears as a well-defined region of raised induration and erythema. Fasciitis {Choice D) refers to infection spreading along a deep fascial plane, most commonly from mixed flora (anaerobic and aerobic bacteria). It typically presents with acute onset of pain, which progresses to anesthesia, at a site of prior trauma or surgery. Evidence of gas production (crepitus), bullae, and severe pain out of proportion to the physical exam are indications of a necrotizing infection. Gout {Choice E) refers to monosodium urate crystals resulting in inflammatory monoarticular arthritis, classically the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Joint fluid analysis shows needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals, with the possibility for erosive changes of underlying cortical bone. Sporotrichosis {Choice G) results from infection by Sporothrix schenckii, a fungus, which grows within the rosettes of conidia plants and is typically introduced through traumatic breakage of the skin (eg, thorn). This results in a local pustule and ulcer formation, with an ascending lymphangitis. The patient's injury was not secondary to injury from vegetation, limiting the likelihood of sporotrichosis as the causative agent for the lymphangitis. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 42 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

Crohn disease is characterized by transmural inflammation that can involve any portion of the gastrointestinal tract, manifesting with skip lesions.

Physical exam findings of Crohn disease include perianal fissures/fistulas, abdominal tenderness, and possible positive fecal occult blood, although bloody stools are not required for the diagnosis. Colonoscopy can demonstrate aphthous or linear ulcers with luminal strictures, inflammatory lesions, and a cobblestone mucosa. Biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis.",

If this type of hernia contains bowel, an obstruction can result. Strangulated hernias occur when the herniated contents lose their blood supply, with the potential for necrosis or perforation. This patient presents with three months of symptoms suggestive of an inguinal hernia that was previously reducible, which explains its spontaneous appearance and disappearance. Now, he presents with three hours of increasing pain with inability to reduce the hernia, which indicates the hernia is incarcerated or strangulated.

Twenty-four hours after nearly drowning, a 24-year-old man in the intensive care unit has not regained consciousness .

An x-ray of the 2 2 chest showed no abnormalities . Now, his temperature is 37.2°C (99°F) , pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 121/60 mm Hg. His respirations are 14/min on the ventilator. Examination shows no edema . Coarse airway sounds are heard on auscultation ; there are no crackles . Heart sounds are distant with no gallops . Laboratory studies show: Leukocyte count 8500/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Lymphocytes 20% Serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dL Arterial blood gas analysis on an F10 of 100% and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 20 cm Hp shows : 2 7.42 38 mm Hg 60 mm Hg An x-ray of the chest is shown . Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current x-ray findings? A) Acute resRiratory distress syndrome B) Bronchiolitis obliterans C) Congestive heart failure D) Diffuse interstitial pneumonia E) Idiopathic interstitial fibrosis Correct Answer: A. Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in response to many etiologies, most commonly infectious, inflammatory, and traumatic. The syndrome results from the effect of cytokines on the pulmonary parenchyma from direct or indirect lung injury. This results in endothelial injury with exudative fluid extending into the alveolar space, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. On chest radiographs, this is characterized by diffuse reticular and airspace opacification. In the case of drowning, aspirated fluid causes local inflammation in the lung, along with the dilution of surfactant, leading to impaired compliance and airspace infiltration. This can result in persistent hypoxia despite rising positive end-expiratory pressure and increased fraction of inspired oxygen. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Bronchiolitis obliterans (Choice B) is characterized by chronic inflammation in the bronchioles and, in some cases, alveoli, which leads to deposition of connective tissue and can show an obstructive lung disease pattern on spirometry. Congestive heart failure (Choice C) results from increased filling pressures or impaired forward flow in the heart. This increases hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary venous circulation, resulting in transudation of fluid from the pulmonary capillaries into the alveolar space, impairing gas exchange. It is not the most likely etiology in a previously healthy young person without cardiomegaly on chest x-ray and a more likely explanation related to recent drowning. Diffuse interstitial pneumonia (Choice D) commonly presents with infectious or inflammatory symptoms such as fever and cough productive of sputum, along with infiltrates on chest x-ray. This patient is afebrile and had a normal chest x-ray on arrival that became abnormal during the hospital course, suggesting that prior to presentation he had been healthy. Idiopathic interstitial fibrosis (Choice E), also known as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is a restrictive lung disease that often presents in older smokers, resulting in chronic and progressive shortness of breath. r-- r \" , r , Exam Section : Item 49 of 50 Medicine Self-Assessment"

Total test scaled scores from CMS forms started on or after October 29, 2015 cannot be directly compared to scaled scores reported prior to October 29, 2015. ® Clinical Science Mastery Series Medicine Self-Assessment Score Interpretation Guide This guide will help you interpret the Assessment Score you received on this self-assessment. The scores on this self-assessment are scaled to have a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 3 based on a recent group of examinees who took the Medicine Subject Examination for the first time as a final clerkship examination. The following information is provided in response to user requests to \"translate\" this self-assessment score to the clinical science subject examination equated percent correct scale. The NBME does not warrant that any individual performance on the self-assessment will predict performance on the clinical science subject examination and cautions users of this self-assessment against making any predictive inferences. In the following table, locate your self-assessment score and find the approximate corresponding subject examination score in the adjacent column. For example, if your self-assessment score is 20, it approximates a Medicine Subject Examination score of 73. Total test scaled scores from CMS forms started on or after October 29, 2015 cannot be directly compared to scaled scores reported prior to October 29, 2015.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Muscle phosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease) is a glycogen storage disease that affects the muscles. It is characterized by the inability of myocytes to break down glycogen as a result of the absence of muscular glycogen phosphorylase, which causes exercise intolerance with fatigue, cramping, and muscle weakness. Muscle cramping may resolve with rest or be permanent. Occasionally, a \"second wind\" phenomenon may be seen when blood flow to the muscles increases after approximate ly 10 minutes of exercise, delivering fatty acids as fuel and relieving the need for glycogen breakdown. Patients may also have episodes of rhabdomyolysis, accompanied by red or brown urine and urinalysis positive for blood resulting from the presence of myoglobinuria without microscopic evidence of red blood cells. A complication of McArdle disease is acute kidney injury and acute tubular necrosis secondary to the release of nephrotoxic myoglobin and heme pigments in rhabdomyolysis. Treatment involves avoiding low-carbohydrate diets and improving cardiovascular fitness with regular, mild aerobic exercise.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Alcoholic rhabdomyolysis refers to muscle breakdown induced by excessive alcohol consumption. Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by a triad of muscle pain, weakness, and dark urine. It may also be brought on by episodes of strenuous exercise, though jogging a short distance would not be expected to cause it. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (Choice B) is characterized by episodes of painless muscle weakness brought on by heavy exercise. Episodes occur in association with low serum potassium concentration. Exercise intolerance with muscle cramping and myoglobinuria is more suggestive of a metabolic myopathy, like McArdle disease. Myasthenic (Lambert-Eaton) syndrome (Choice D) is a paraneoplastic syndrome often caused by small cell carcinoma of the lung. Presynaptic calcium channel antibody production causes the proximal extremity weakness. A characteristic physical examination feature is the augmentation of strength with repetitive action, which is caused by progressive increases in calcium concentration Clinical E) Polymyositis Correct Answer: C.

Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Liver function tests (Choice A) may be abnormal in patients with acute liver failure or patients with cirrhosis who present with altered mental status.

Measurement of serum vitamin B (cobalamin) concentration (Choice B) is unlikely to be helpful. Decreased concentrations of vitamin 12 B (cobalamin) can result in peripheral neuropathy and impaired proprioception from subacute combined degeneration of the dorsal 12 and lateral columns of the spinal cord. Patients also frequently demonstrate a macrocytic anemia. Serum toxicology screening (Choice C) is frequently performed in the evaluation of delirium when a good history cannot be obtained or when there are other signs of intoxication. This patient's caregivers did not report a recent history of substance ingestion, so a toxicology screen is unlikely to be helpful. Thyroid function tests (Choice D) are unlikely to be helpful. Patients with altered mental status from hyperthyroidism often have concomitant findings of heat intolerance, sweating, tachycardia, and hypertension, while patients with severe hypothyroidism present with reduced levels of consciousness, not hyperactive delirium."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Patients who chronically use alcohol typically demonstrate a significant vitamin B (thiamine) deficiency caused by poor nutritional 1 intake, thiamine malabsorption, and impaired cellular utilization of thiamine. Over time, thiamine deficiency can result in damage and atrophy of the mammillary bodies, visible on MRI of the brain, which manifests as Wernicke encephalopathy. To prevent Wernicke encephalopathy, all patients with sustained heavy alcohol use should be given oral thiamine supplementation, and patients presenting with acute intoxication should generally be given parenteral thiamine. The typical clinical presentation of Wernicke encephalopathy is a triad of acutely altered mental status, ophthalmoplegia (along with nystagmus), and ataxia. The symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy are reversible but increase the risk for developing Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in patients with alcohol use disorder if not immediately treated with high-dose parenteral thiamine. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is an irreversible condition that features psychosis, anterograde and retrograde amnesia, and the consequent tendency to confabulate, or verbalize false stories or memories, to compensate for the inability to remember.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is the most likely diagnosis in this elderly woman with myalgia, bitemporal headache, and markedly increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). PMR is an inflammatory disorder that often occurs concurrently with giant cell arteritis (GCA), a large vessel vasculitis. Symptoms include proximal muscle and joint (eg, shoulder and hip girdle) pain and stiffness. If untreated, muscle weakness may occur from disuse atrophy. Systemic symptoms such as fatigue are commonly seen. The diagnosis is clinical, and treatment is with low-dose prednisone for up to a year. It is common for patients to respond to prednisone almost immediately, thus the absence of response should prompt consideration of a different diagnosis. As GCA occurs concurrently in up to 20% of patients who have PMR, symptoms of throbbing temporal headache, vision changes, or jaw claudication should prompt temporal artery biopsy and initiation of high-dose prednisone.",

Concurrent findings may also include uveitis, increased inflammatory markers, and positive HLA-B27. Pelvic x-rays may show sacroiliitis, although MRI is more sensitive.",
        "D": "Polymyositis is an inflammatory myopathy that can also present with proximal muscle pain, but it is frequently accompanied by weakness. Inflammatory markers may be increased but are nonspecific. Serum creatinine kinase may also be increased and can provide a clue to diagnosis. Muscle biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Choice E) commonly presents with symmetric arthritis of the metacarpophalangea l and wrist joints in younger patients, but may also present with arthritis of the shoulder, elbow, ankles, and proximal interphalangeal joints. Laboratory studies often, but not always, show positive rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide. This patient's age is atypical for RA."

Radiculopathy refers to the neurologic symptoms secondary to the compression of spinal nerve roots either as a result of a herniated intervertebral disc, a narrow or stenotic neural foramen, or compression from extrinsic sources such as tumors or infection. Patients present with pain and occasionally with weakness in the dermatome and/or myotome supplied by the affected nerve root. Radiculopathy is most common in the lumbosacral region. This patient, who presents with sensory changes affecting the buttocks, posterior leg, and lateral foot most likely has radiculopathy from compression of the S1 nerve root. The presence of sensory symptoms in the absence of motor symptoms suggests compression of the posterior nerve root, as this contains sensory fibers. Compression leads to edema and inflammation of the nerve root and surrounding structures, which causes pain. This is most effectively treated with anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen. Over time, most patients will improve with conservative care and graded exercise or physical therapy.",

It does not treat the underlying inflammation associated with radiculopathy and is not considered first-line therapy. Prednisone therapy (Choice D) is not the correct answer. While glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone are sometimes used for patients with acute spinal cord compression from trauma or expanding tumors, there are many adverse effects associated with glucocorticoids. This patient's radiculopathy is more appropriately treated with ibuprofen. Nerve conduction studies (Choice E) can be performed in instances where the examination findings are not diagnostically helpful.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient's fundus findings of intraretinal hemorrhage, retinal nerve fiber layer infarctions, exudates, and multiple foci of neovascularization along the superior arcade are suggestive of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Chronic hyperglycemia caused by poorly controlled diabetes mellitus results in deposition of advanced glycation end products within capillary vessels, leading to microvascular damage. Within the retina, this process results in retinal ischemia and clinical signs of microvascu lar damage such as microaneurysms, retinal hemorrhage, retinal nerve fiber layer infarctions, and intraretinal edema and exudate deposition. These findings are characteristic of the several stages of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Once retinal ischemia becomes sufficiently severe, the increased production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by the ischemic retina leads to retinal neovascularization, the hallmark of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Neovascularization may lead to tractional retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and neovascular glaucoma, and it may cause permanent blindness. Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy is treated with rigorous glycemic control. Once neovascularization occurs, patients are treated with either intravitreal injections of monoclonal antibodies against VEGF (eg, bevacizumab, ranibizumab, aflibercept) or argon laser panretinal photocoagulation to reduce the intraocular burden of VEGF Exam Section : Item 11 of 50 Clinical This patient's fundus findings of intraretinal hemorrhage, retinal nerve fiber layer infarctions, exudates, and multiple foci of neovascularization along the superior arcade are suggestive of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Chronic hyperglycemia caused by poorly controlled diabetes mellitus results in deposition of advanced glycation end products within capillary vessels, leading to microvascular damage. Within the retina, this process results in retinal ischemia and clinical signs of microvascular damage such as microaneurysms, retinal hemorrhage, retinal nerve fiber layer infarctions, and intraretinal edema and exudate deposition. These findings are characteristic of the several stages of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

The straight-leg raise would not elicit pain. Metastatic carcinoma (Choice D) may spread to the epidural space of the spinal cord, which may lead to spinal cord compression. Symptoms of spinal cord compression include lower extremity numbness, weakness, paralysis, abnorma l deep tendon reflexes, perinea! anesthesia, fecal incontinence with poor rectal tone, and overflow incontinence marked by the inability to void with associated urinary retention. Spinal stenosis (Choice E) is narrowing of the spinal canal, often secondary to degenerative joint disease, which results in compression of the nerve roots or spinal cord.

Opioid analgesics are indicated for the management of pain associated with malignancy. Dosage often needs to be increased because of progression of metastatic disease as well as the development of opioid tolerance. Tolerance describes the need for an increasing dose of medication to achieve the same effect as prior doses. This occurs as a result of the downregulation of opioid receptors with recurrent and/or prolonged exposure. It is important to recognize that pain caused by cancer is associated with significant limitations in functional status and quality of life.",

        "B": "Intent to attempt suicide is less likely in this scenario than inadequate pain control. Prescription of opioid analgesics (as well as other central nervous system depressants) carries a risk for unintentional or intentional overdose. Major depressive disorder (Choice C) is associated with many types of cancer, and patients should be assessed for symptoms and self-harm ideations. Patients should also be counseled on the risks of overdose, recognition of the signs of overdose, and prescribed a naloxone kit with instructions on use in an emergency. Substance abuse (Choice D) and surreptitious use of morphine by family (Choice E) are also risks of prescription opioid analgesics, but less likely than inadequate pain control for the dosage increase request in this scenario. It is the responsibility of the prescriber to assess for the inappropriate use of opioid analgesics, such as misuse, diverting pills, or obtaining similar medications from multiple prescribers. A thorough history should be taken to examine for prior difficulties with substance abuse, comorbid psychiatric disorders should be appropriate ly managed, and continuous monitoring for patterns of aberrant behavior should be performed."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Myopathy is a potential adverse effect of long-term corticosteroid use, which is frequently required for the treatment of dermatomyositis. Myopathy occurs as a result of the catabolic effect of glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) on muscle. It typically manifests with the progressive onset of proximal muscle weakness followed by muscle atrophy. Myalgias and muscle tenderness do not typically occur. Other adverse effects of corticosteroids, including a cushingoid appearance, may also be present. Corticosteroid myopathy is not associated with inflammation or cellular damage; thus, creatine kinase and aldolase levels are normal. This is in contrast to dermatomyositis, which is caused by an inflammatory infiltrate of the muscle causing myocyte damage, leading to the release of intracellular molecules, including creatine kinase and aldolase. Active dermatomyositis would also be expected to show cutaneous features such as pink papules over the dorsal fingers (Gottron papules), pink to light purple patches over the upper eyelids (heliotrope sign), light pink to lilac-colored patches with telangiectasias on the upper back and sun-exposed chest (shawl sign), and dilated capillaries with drop out on the proximal nail folds.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Hypothyroidism may present with myopathy and myalgias, typically associated with increased creatine kinase levels. Other symptoms of hypothyroidism are commonly present, including weight gain, fatigue, constipation, cold intolerance, and menstrual irregularities. Physical examination may show bradycardia, dry, edematous skin, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Major depressive disorder (Choice C) is characterized by depressed mood, decreased energy, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, appetite disturbances, guilt, poor concentration, and psychomotor agitation or retardation. Decreased energy or psychomotor retardation may be perceived as muscle weakness, but this patient's history of dermatomyositis, lack of other depressive symptoms, and demonstration of manifestations of glucocorticoid use indicate this as a more likely cause. Peripheral neuropathy (Choice D) has a variety of causes including diabetes mellitus, vitamin deficiency, and medication use, and can be primarily sensory, motor, or both. While motor neuropathy may cause progressive weakness, it is not seen in dermatomyositis and would not explain the patient's cushingoid appearance. Progressive myositis (Choice E) may occur when dermatomyositis is inadequately treated. A perimysial CD4+ T-lymphocyte inflammatory infiltrate causes damage to the myocytes, leading to release of creatine kinase and aldolase, intracellular molecules. This patient's dermatomyositis is well controlled, and the normal creatine kinase and aldolase levels suggest an alternative cause of muscle weakness."

All elderly patients with new-onset cognitive impairment should be assessed for reversible causes with a thorough history, physical examination, laboratory testing, neuroimaging, and medication review. Incorrect Answer: B, C, D, E, F, and G. Obtaining a durable power of attorney (Choice B), recommending 24-hour in-home nursing assistance (Choice F), and labeling the drawers and cabinets for contents (Choice G) should be considered in patients with irreversible cognitive impairment that prevents them from making their own decisions or functioning at home. This patient's subacute confusion instead coincides with the addition of an anticholinergic medication and will likely reverse with medication discontinuation. This patient's mild cortical atrophy on CT scan may reflect normal aging changes. EEG (Choice C) may assist in diagnosing delirium or cognitive impairment when the cause of mental status change is unclear. However, the diagnosis of delirium or cognitive impairment can frequently be made clinically. This patient with a likely precipitant of cognitive impairment should have the precipitating cause addressed. Fluorescent treponemal antibody assay (Choice D) assists in diagnosing syphilis, which can spread to the central nervous system to cause neurosyphilis. Neurosyphilis may result in a chronically progressive dementia. Though syphilis testing is considered in patients with cognitive impairment who possess risk factors for syphilis, this patient's subacute confusion instead coincides with the addition of an anticholinergic medication. Prescribing an antidepressant (Choice E) would be appropriate in patients with pseudodementia, or cognitive impairment resulting from major depressive disorder. This patient does not show neurovegetative symptoms (eg, decreased energy or changes in appetite or sleep) or other depressive symptoms."

On imaging, SDH appears as a crescent-shaped collection abutting the internal surface of the skull, not bound by suture lines. In some cases, the SDH may be large enough to compress adjacent brain parenchyma; the displacement of the cerebral hemisphere can result in neurologic deficits, altered mental status, seizures, herniation syndromes, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Patients may manifest upper motoneuron examination findings such as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar reflex (Babinski sign). Elderly patients are at risk for cerebral atrophy, which places traction on bridging cortical veins. In this setting, minor trauma such as falls can result in shearing of the veins leading to hemorrhage. Untreated, the SDH may continue to grow in size. The intracranial compartment is a fixed space within a rigid skull; pathologic lesions such as SDH can result in midline shift and herniation of central nervous system structures if large enough. When such mass effect is present or at risk of developing, surgical interventions such as decompressive burr holes or a craniotomy may be indicated to evacuate the hematoma.",

Severe hypothyroidism (Choice D) can present with altered mental status but would be unlikely to cause focal neurologic deficits.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "An abnormality of the facial nerve is the most likely cause of this patient's left facial droop. Involvement of the forehead strongly suggests a peripheral nerve injury as opposed to a central nervous system injury, such as a cerebral infarction, which would cause an upper motoneuron pattern of facial weakness, sparing the muscles of the forehead. When complete ipsilateral facial nerve palsy occurs in isolation, it is known as Bell palsy, which is thought to most commonly be related to the reactivation of herpes simplex virus, though it is often idiopathic. It is typically a benign condition that gradually improves over time, although treatment with oral steroids and occasionally with acyclovir is indicated to expedite recovery. The facial nerve, also known as cranial nerve VII, provides motor innervation to the muscles of the face, parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal, submandibu lar, and sublingual salivary glands, and sensory innervation to the distal part of the tongue and the external auditory canal. Abnormalities of hearing and taste can also occur but typically improve over time.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Muscle is not the correct answer. The facial nerve innervates numerous facial muscles, and it is the loss of innervation that causes weakness; the facial muscles do not exhibit any particular pathology. Myoneural junction (Choice C), also known as the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), is the area where nerve fibers make contact with skeletal muscle. Diseases that affect the NMJ are classified as presynaptic (myasthenic syndrome) or postsynaptic (myasthenia gravis). These diseases typica lly present with diffuse weakness. Patients with Bell palsy have an intact NMJ. Nerve roots (Choice E) typically describe either the anterior (motor) or dorsal (sensory) components of spinal nerves. The two roots join to form a spinal nerve that carries both sensory and motor fibers to peripheral tissues. In contrast, cranial nerves do not have distinct nerve roots."

Acute migraine treatment includes triptans (serotonin 1b /1 d agonists) and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). For patients with disabling or frequent migraines, prophylactic treatment to reduce the frequency of migraine headaches is also recommended and includes ~-adrenergic blocking agents (eg, propranolol, metoprolol), tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and anticonvulsants such as topiramate or valproate.",

Paraneoplastic syndromes, which are commonly seen in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), can mimic cisplatin-induced neuropathy, but this patient does not have a history of SCLC, and does not appear to have any evidence of a metastatic malignancy.",

Meningeal carcinoma (Choice C) refers to metastatic disease that has spread to the meninges, which can occasionally occur with ovarian cancer. Patients typically present with cranial neuropathies, headache, seizures, and diplopia. Multiple sclerosis (Choice D) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease that most commonly presents in white women around the age of 40 to 50 years. It is characterized by central nervous system demyelination of white matter in both the brain and the spinal cord. This can lead to a variety of neurologic deficits, including weakness, hyperreflexia, and spasticity. Optic neuritis is a classic presenting diagnosis.

This patient instead demonstrates dysfunction of the upper and lower extremities. Lesions of a cervical nerve root (Choice D), lumbar nerve root (Choice E), or peripheral nerve (Choice F) typically lead to ipsilateral motor and/or sensory deficits, not contralateral deficits in pain and temperature sensation. Nerve roots carry motor and sensory fibers. Lesions of cervical nerve roots typically cause motor and sensory symptoms in an upper body myotome/dermatome, while lesions of lumbar nerve roots typically cause motor and sensory symptoms in a lower body myotome/dermatome.

Symptoms of MOD include 2 or more weeks of depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, difficulty concentrating, suicidal thoughts, and/or neurovegetative symptoms (decreased energy, sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance). These symptoms disrupt everyday functioning, as evidenced by this patient's poor personal hygiene. Elderly patients may view their neurovegetative symptoms as a manifestation of normal aging or a comorbid medical condition rather than depression. Consequently, depressed elderly patients may struggle to express their depressed mood, though MOD should be suspected in this patient with many other depressive symptoms. MOD in elderly patients can cause pseudodementia, which refers to cognitive impairment secondary to depression, manifesting as this patient's short-term memory difficulties and decreased effort on a brief cognitive screening. Physicians should always inquire about suicida l ideation in patients with MOD. Mood and cognition typically improve with antidepressant medication Clinical by slow speech).

      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Adjustment disorder with depressed mood refers to depressive symptoms beginning within three months of a stressor and associated with a significant impairment in functioning. Dysthymic disorder (Choice D), commonly known as persistent depressive disorder, refers to depressive symptoms lasting longer than two years. Both disorders may include energy, sleep, and appetite changes without meeting the criteria of MOD.",
        "B": "Delirium is an acute confusional state typically associated with medical illness in older patients. Delirium presents with acute disturbances in awareness, attention, and baseline cognition that fluctuate in severity over the course of the day. This patient does not show evidence of an acute medical condition or fluctuating cognitive symptoms, rather the patient demonstrates 1 month of progressive cognitive decline. Dementia, Alzheimer type (Choice C) is the most prevalent dementia, presenting with progressive cognitive decline that begins with short-term memory impairment, progresses to apraxia and language abnorma lities, and culminates in behavioral and personality changes preventing the patient from performing basic activities of daily living. Dementia, Alzheimer type, would not present with this patient's constellation of neurovegetative symptoms or this degree of functional impairment after only one month of symptoms. Parkinson disease (Choice F) presents with dysfunction of voluntary movements in the form of bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. Dementia may occur late in the disease course and would not be expected after only 1 month of symptoms. Substance-induced persisting amnestic disorder (Choice G) refers to anterograde or retrograde memory impairment that persists beyond the expected period of intoxication or withdrawal. This patient illustrates deficits in cognitive domains (eg, attention) along with symptoms of depression, making MOD the most likely diagnosis."

Oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) therapy (Choice D) is typically given as prophylaxis against toxoplasmosis in patients with HIV and CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 100/mm3. High-dose TMP-SMX can be used as an alternative treatment for toxoplasmosis but is given intravenously. Lumbar puncture (Choice E) should be avoided in this patient as he has focal neurologic deficits and a mass on neuroimaging, which raises suspicion for increased intracranial pressure. Lumbar puncture is the preferred diagnostic test for patients with suspected meningitis or meningoencephalitis, not intraparenchyma l cerebral disease. Brain biopsy (Choice F) may be required if this patient does not respond to empiric therapy. The patient should first be given sulfadiazine-pyrimethamine and observed for improvement. If there is no improvement, brain biopsy should be considered to rule out a cerebral abscess or primary central nervous system lymphoma. Educational Objective: Cerebral toxoplasmosis is an AIDS-defining illness that occurs in patients with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts <100/mm 3 and presents with one or more ring-enhancing lesions on MRI, often with focal neurologic deficits. Empiric treatment with sulfadiazine-pyrimethamine is warranted with close clinical observation. Failure to improve should prompt further investigation with a brain biopsy to rule out a cerebral abscess or primary central nervous system lymphoma Clinical",

Symptoms include lower extremity numbness, weakness, paralysis, hyporeflexia, perinea! anesthesia, fecal incontinence with poor rectal tone, and overflow incontinence marked by the inability to appropriately void and associated urinary retention. Emergent MRI of the lumbosacral spine is indicated to investigate the cause of cauda equina syndrome, and to determine the necessity of surgical decompression. Initial treatment for patients with epidural spinal cord compression and neurologic deficits include symptomatic treatment, pain control, and glucocorticoid therapy prior to definitive medical or surgical therapy. High-dose glucocorticoid therapy is helpful as a bridge to definitive therapy, as it may transiently improve neurologic function in patients by decreasing edema at the site of cord compression.",

Other anticholinergic effects can include dry mouth, sedation, constipation, hallucinations, delirium, ataxia, flushed skin, and visual disturbances (cycloplegia). Such effects are uncommon with fluoxetine, and malignant compression is much more likely in this case.",

This patient's altered mental status, seizures, and confusion are likely to the result of severe hyponatremia secondary to paraneoplastic SIADH in undiagnosed lung cancer. ADH results in increased aquaporin expression on the luminal surface of collecting duct cells, which increases the membrane permeability to water, leading to inappropriate free water reabsorption, hyponatremia, decreased serum osmolality, and inappropriate ly increased urine concentration. The management of SIADH-associated hyponatremia involves treatment of the underlying disease, restriction of water intake, and gradual sodium correction. If there are associated severe neurologic symptoms, administration of hypertonic saline may be considered to quickly correct the sodium concentration, although this must be performed with caution.",

This results in parasympathetic innervation of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes and inhibition of sympathetic vascular tone. In turn, this causes decreased pulse and peripheral vascular resistance. Mechanical compression of the baroreceptors from external palpation, such as during shaving of the neck, can potentially stimulate this reflex. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, E, and F. Absence seizure (Choice A) is characterized by a transient blank stare, and typically occurs in brief episodes multiple times throughout the day. It is more common in children. EEG monitoring characteristically shows 3-Hz spike-and-wave complexes during the episodes. Often, patients disclose no postictal confusion. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with absence seizure. Aortic stenosis (Choice B) presents with a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the upper right sternal border with radiation to the carotid arteries. Syncope associated with aortic stenosis typically occurs during exertion because of the inability to increase stroke volume to match perfusion demands, resulting in consequent cerebral hypoperfusion. Syncope during shaving or other mild activities is less consistent with aortic stenosis. Generalized tonic-clonic seizure (Choice D) is the most common type of generalized seizure and is characterized by the sudden onset of muscle contractions followed by rhythmic jerking of the extremities. Bowel and/or bladder incontinence commonly occurs. Episodes are accompanied by a postictal state marked by confusion and fatigue. Neurocardiogenic (vasovagal) syncope (Choice E) is a common cause of syncope, often associated with nausea, lightheadedness, visual disturbances, pallor, and/or diaphoresis. Symptoms usually occur after standing for a prolonged period. A normal tilt test in this patient makes this diagnosis less likely than carotid sinus hypersensitivity syndrome. Transient ischemic attack (Choice F) is defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without infarction. A transient ischemic attack resulting in syncope does not typically present with a postictal state."

It is characterized by the inability of myocytes to break down glycogen as a result of the absence of muscular glycogen phosphorylase, which causes exercise intolerance with fatigue, cramping, and muscle weakness. Muscle cramping may resolve with rest or be permanent. Occasionally, a \"second wind\" phenomenon may be seen when blood flow to the muscles increases after approximate ly 10 minutes of exercise, delivering fatty acids as fuel and relieving the need for glycogen breakdown. Patients may also have episodes of rhabdomyolysis, accompanied by red or brown urine and urinalysis positive for blood resulting from the presence of myoglobinuria without microscopic evidence of red blood cells. A complication of McArdle disease is acute kidney injury and acute tubular necrosis secondary to the release of nephrotoxic myoglobin and heme pigments in rhabdomyolysis.

Visual field testing (Choice C) may be useful for the diagnosis of glaucoma or cortical vision loss. Delaying the search for embolic sources while pursuing other diagnostic tests puts the patient at risk for ischemic stroke and blindness. MRI of the brain (Choice D) may be useful for the diagnosis of optic neuritis. It is not useful for identifying the source of emboli that are causing this patient's amaurosis fugax. Vision loss secondary to optic neuritis typically lasts for several days or weeks, rather than minutes. Ocular tonometry (Choice F) allows for the measurement of intraocular pressure and is useful for the diagnosis of glaucoma, which is characterized by slowly progressive optic nerve damage in the setting of increased intraocular pressure. The vision loss caused by glaucoma is insidious and characterized by initial peripheral vision loss with slow encroachment upon central vision. Glaucoma does not present with amaurosis fugax."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Choice A) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the anterior horns along with the lateral corticospinal tract as it descends in the brain and spinal cord. Subsequently, patients demonstrate a combination of upper and lower motor neuron findings in an asymmetric distribution that may include the bulbar muscles.

Guillain-Barre syndrome (Choice B) is an inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy that presents with acute-onset, ascending, bilateral muscle weakness with hyporeflexia. Many patients also demonstrate autonomic dysfunction and/or sensory symptoms. A chronic time course and an upper motor neuron pattern of dysfunction are inconsistent with Guillain-Barre syndrome. Postherpetic neuralgia (Choice C) refers to prolonged burning pain after the resolution of shingles. Motor dysfunction is inconsistent with postherpetic neuralgia. Tabes dorsalis (Choice E) refers to neurosyphilis of the posterior columns and dorsal roots of the spinal cord.

In the primary infection, patients present with subacute fevers, weight loss, night sweats, cough, and malaise. Active tuberculosis is treated primarily with a combination of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. lsoniazid binds vitamin B (pyridoxine) which may result in early excretion and inactivation of pyridoxine, 6 and also inhibits pyridoxine phosphokinase, which is necessary to activate it. Pyridoxine deficiency then results, of which the primary symptoms are peripheral neuropathy or paresthesia. Therefore, all patients taking isoniazid concurrently take pyridoxine supplementation. Pyridoxine deficiency limits synthesis of histamine, hemoglobin, and neurotransmitters including epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and y-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In addition to peripheral neuropathy, deficiency commonly presents with dermatitis, sideroblastic anemia, glossitis, and seizures.",

Folate is contained in leafy vegetables and absorbed in the jejunum. Folate deficiency is often seen in patients with malnutrition, alcohol use disorder, and patients taking anti-folate medications (eg, phenytoin, methotrexate). It is not caused by any of the medications used to treat tuberculosis. lsoniazid (Choice C) binds vitamin B and leads to deficiency if not adequately supplemented. Deficiency of vitamin B causes 6 6 peripheral neuropathy, as in this case.

Oxalate crystals are seen on urine microscopy. These metabolites also contribute to an anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "A thorough neurologic examination should include evaluation of the cranial nerves, gait, coordination, movement, muscle strength and tone, light touch, pain and temperature sensation, deep tendon reflexes, and the plantar response (Babinski sign). Deep tendon reflexes can be checked over the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, knee, and Achilles tendons using a reflex hammer. They are graded on a scale of Oto 4 where 0 is absent, 2 is normal, and 4 is clonus (continual contraction). Reflex strength should be compared on either side and within the same patient. The Achilles reflex test is particularly useful for evaluating pathology of the S1 nerve root and differentiating upper from lower motor neuron dysfunction. However, bilaterally absent Achilles reflex is also a normal variation, the proportion of which increases with age. Thus, in this case, the absence of both Achilles reflexes does not require any additional management. Educational Objectives: A, B, C, and D. Measurement of urine lead concentration (Choice A) is appropriate when lead poisoning is suspected. Symptoms of lead poisoning occur within days or weeks of exposure and include distal motor neuropathy. While this does cause hyporeflexia, it would affect all the reflexes in the body, not just the Achilles. It would also cause other lower motor neuron symptoms such as muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations, which this patient lacks. MRI of the lumbar spine (Choice B) would be beneficial in evaluating hyporeflexia because of a spinal nerve or spinal cord lesion. Neither of these pathologies would present with bilaterally absent Achilles reflexes alone without other symptoms like back pain or muscle weakness. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies (Choice C) are used to support a diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis. This condition is associated with muscle weakness, not peripheral neuropathy.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Increased serotonin likely explains this patient's sexual dysfunction. Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that increases synaptic serotonin activity and improves mood in patients with major depressive disorder. SSRls commonly cause sexual dysfunction within all three phases of sexual response (libido, sexual arousal, and orgasm). If the sexual dysfunction is persistent and distressing, management commonly involves lowering the SSRI dose, switching to an antidepressant with a lower risk for sexual dysfunction (eg, bupropion, mirtazapine), or adding bupropion or a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor such as sildenafil. Libido is typically enhanced by dopamine and gonadal hormones and may be inhibited by medications such as antipsychotics and SSRls. Arousal is promoted by acetylcholine, which leads to vasodilation of the helicine/vaginal arteries and consequent penile/clitora l tumescence. Medications with anticholinergic activity and SSRls inhibit arousal. Norepinephrine enhances orgasm (and ejaculation), and beta blockers and SSRls inhibit orgasm.",

        "A": "Acetylcholine mediates arousal via the vasodilation of the helicine or vaginal arteries. Medications with anticholinergic activity, which include paroxetine but not sertraline within the SSRI class, may inhibit arousal but would not likely affect libido or ejaculation. y-Aminobutyric acid (Choice B), or GABA, is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. GABA is not known to be involved in sexual response.",

Migraine triggers include stress, menstruation, weather changes, fasting, and alcoholic beverages. Sleep may improve migraines. Migraines are postulated to arise from deficient serotonin inhibition of descending pain pathways. Acute migraine treatment includes triptans and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Over time, patients with AS can develop decreased spine mobility, hyperkyphosis, osteopenia, and an increased risk for vertebra l fragility fractures. Laboratory studies demonstrate increased acute phase reactant concentrations (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) along with a positive HLA-B27 test in many patients.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Transient ischemic attack is defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without evidence of infarction. This patient has multiple risk factors for ischemic stroke including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, atherosclerotic disease, and atrial fibrillation. An embolic ischemic stroke involves an event in which a clot breaks off and travels to the brain, occluding blood flow at a cerebral artery. Emboli can come from proximal vessels, such as the internal carotid artery, or from an atrial thrombus. This patient has an atrial thrombus, which can embolize and cause an ischemic stroke. After a transient ischemic attack, measures for prevention of an ischemic stroke should be enacted. In this patient with atrial fibrillation and a known atrial thrombus, an anticoagulant would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to help prevent ischemic stroke. Warfarin is an anticoagulant that interferes with the carboxylation of coagulation factors. This occurs through the inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase, which is necessary for recycling vitamin K, an essentia l cofactor in the synthesis of coagulation factors in the liver.",

Acoustic neuromas are benign tumors consisting of Schwann cells that arise from the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII). Lesions of the vestibulocochlear nerve typically disrupt ipsilateral hearing and the sensation of head and body position, which leads to difficulty with balance and tandem (heel-to-toe) gait as in this patient. Mass effect from progressive ly enlarging acoustic neuromas can compress the neighboring facial nerve or the upper motor neurons synapsing on the facial nerve, leading to a flattened nasolabial fold and perioral droop. If the upper motor neurons are affected, the forehead is spared, as the facial nerve nucleus that controls forehead musculature is dually innervated by upper motor neurons from bilateral precentral gyri. Because of this, the patient would be expected to symmetrically raise her eyebrows. Alternatively, lesions involving the lower motor neurons of facial expression (eg, facial nerve inflammation in Bell palsy) affect the forehead and lower face together. Depending on patient age, tumor size, and symptom burden, acoustic neuromas can be managed with observation, radiation, or surgery.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common cause of vertigo that occurs as a result of a calcium carbonate particle (otoconium) that gets displaced from the otolith organs into the adjacent semicircu lar canals. The otolith organs and semicircular canals are located in the inner ear and sense movement of the head. Normally, otoconia are contained within the matrix of the otolith organs, adding weight to the organs so that the organs shift in position when head position changes. When otoconia become dislodged, they cause abnormal movement of the endolymph within the semicircular canals and the subsequent sensation of head movement. Consequently, patients present with minutes-long, abrupt episodes of vertigo that may be accompanied by nausea, which resolve when holding still. The cochlear apparatus is intact, resulting in normal hearing. Symptom resolution with particle repositioning maneuvers such as the Epley maneuver serves to both diagnose and treat BPPV. Vertigo is the sensation that the surroundings are moving and is associated with lesions of the peripheral or central vestibular system. Peripheral vertigo is typically short-lived and sudden in onset, whereas central vertigo is insidious in onset and may cause constant and sustained vertigo.

Additionally, sensory and r ~ -- - - , r, Exam Section : Item 28 of 50 Clinical Correct Answer: C. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common cause of vertigo that occurs as a result of a calcium carbonate particle (otoconium) that gets displaced from the otolith organs into the adjacent semicircu lar canals. The otolith organs and semicircular canals are located in the inner ear and sense movement of the head. Normally, otoconia are contained within the matrix of the otolith organs, adding weight to the organs so that the organs shift in position when head position changes. When otoconia become dislodged, they cause abnormal movement of the endolymph within the semicircular canals and the subsequent sensation of head movement. Consequently, patients present with minutes-long, abrupt episodes of vertigo that may be accompanied by nausea, which resolve when holding still. The cochlear apparatus is intact, resulting in normal hearing. Symptom resolution with particle repositioning maneuvers such as the Epley maneuver serves to both diagnose and treat BPPV. Vertigo is the sensation that the surroundings are moving and is associated with lesions of the peripheral or central vestibular system. Peripheral vertigo is typically short-lived and sudden in onset, whereas central vertigo is insidious in onset and may cause constant and sustained vertigo. Peripheral causes of vertigo such as BPPV may also present with uni- or multidirectional nystagmus and may decrease as patients focus their gaze, while central causes of vertigo such as brainstem tumors or strokes typically lead to purely unidirectional nystagmus that does not improve with primary gaze. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E. Lesions of the auditory cortex (Choice A), located in the temporal lobe, result in impairment of the conscious perception of auditory sensations. The vestibular cortices are instead distributed across the parietal and temporal cortices. A brain stem (Choice B) mass of the cerebellopontine angle (eg, acoustic neuroma, meningioma, glioma) typically affects the vestibulocochlear nerve and may also affect other cranial nerves (eg, trigeminal, abducens, facial nerves). The resulting vertigo would likely be insidious in onset and constant (rather than episodic); also likely to be accompanied by hearing loss. Additionally, sensory and motor dysfunction of the face or extraocular muscles may occur. The ossicles (Choice D) are the small bones of the middle ear that transmit the mechanical vibrations of the tympanic membrane to the cochlea. The ossicles transmit sound but not vestibular information. The spiral ganglion (Choice E) of the cochlea is a group of cell bodies that receive innervation from the hair cells and unite to form the auditory nerve. The spiral ganglion does not carry vestibular information."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient likely has Sydenham chorea, which is a manifestation of an autoimmune disorder of the basal ganglia. The combination of choreiform movements and migratory joint pain suggest a diagnosis of rheumatic fever, a complication of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) infection. Though arthritis is typically an early manifestation of acute rheumatic fever, Sydenham chorea is a latent manifestation and may occur months after the initial streptococcal infection. In acute rheumatic fever, streptococca l infection causes immune cross-reactivity with neuronal and cardiac cell membrane proteins and the deposition of immune complexes in the joints and soft tissues. The binding of antibodies to basal ganglia neurons results in choreiform movements (involuntary, random, irregular movements) of the face, trunk, and extremities that may be more prominent on one side of the body. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as emotional !ability and obsessive-compulsive disorder (a disorder associated with basal ganglia pathology) may also occur. Sydenham chorea may occur as an isolated manifestation of acute rheumatic fever or in conjunction with arthritis, carditis, erythema marginatum, and/or subcutaneous nodules. As such, patients with Sydenham chorea should receive an echocardiography to evaluate for carditis. The treatment of acute rheumatic fever involves nonsteroida l anti-inflammatory drugs and penicillin to ensure the eradication of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A). Sydenham chorea is typically self-limited, but severe and impairing neuropsychiatric symptoms may be managed with antipsychotic or anticonvulsant medication.",

        "D": "Hypercalcemia may present with anxiety, depression, or cognitive dysfunction. Chorea would be atypical.",
        "E": "Hypothyroidism is associated with mood changes but not choreiform movements. Hyperthyroidism is associated with subacute chorea.

This patient's visual fields demonstrate a left superior field quadrantanopia. In conjunction with her symptoms of seizures, characterized by staring, chewing movements, automatisms of the hands, and postictal confusion, a left superior field quadrantanopia raises concern for a lesion of the right temporal lobe, such as an astrocytoma. After decussating at the optic chiasm, retinal ganglion cell axons carrying information from the left visual field traverse the optic radiations and synapse at the lateral geniculate nucleus. Neurons from the lateral geniculate nucleus travel to the primary visual cortex via the optic radiations, which divide into superior and inferior divisions. The right superior division travels through the right parietal lobe and carries information from the right inferior visual fields. In contrast, the right inferior division travels through the right temporal lobe by looping around the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle, forming the Meyer loop, and carries information from the right superior visual fields. Lesions of the temporal lobe that interrupt the Meyer loop produce a characteristic contralateral superior quadrantanopia, a visual defect described as a wedge-shaped loss of vision.",

Lesions affecting the frontal eye fields can produce an ipsilateral conjugate gaze preference but do not produce visual field deficits. The occipital lobe (Choice B) is the location of the primary visual cortex. Lesions of the occipital lobe produce homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing. The optic nerve (Choice C) carries all the visual information from the retina of its respective eye. A lesion of the optic nerve, such as in the setting of glioma, demyelinating optic neuritis, or trauma, produces a complete visual field defect of one eye. The parietal lobe (Choice D) contains the superior division of the optic radiation, which carries information from the inferior visual fields.

Neurons degenerate because of an unknown etiology that may involve RNA processing and/or excitotoxicity, and gliosis results. Patient presentations are variable, though typically feature a combination of upper motor neuron (eg, increased muscle tone, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign) and lower motor neuron findings (eg, decreased muscle tone, hyporeflexia, early muscle atrophy) in an asymmetric distribution that may include the bulbar muscles. Some patients may experience cognitive or behavioral changes, though other patients are cognitively normal. The diagnosis is primarily clinical but may be supported by electromyographic findings of acute and chronic denervation and reinnervation. MRI of the brain and spine should be performed to rule out other diseases. Treatment should include riluzole, which may modestly improve survival but does not cure the disease.",

However, generalized dysfunction in both an upper and lower motor neuron pattern is more consistent with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Neuronal ganglioside GM deposition (Choice E) occurs in Tay-Sachs disease, a heritable lysosomal storage disease that presents with 2 motor neuron degeneration. A combination of upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron dysfunction is possible, but symptoms typically begin in infancy and are usually symmetric. Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra (Choice F) occurs in Parkinson disease and leads to resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability.

Though donepezil may slow the rate of cognitive decline and modestly improve functiona lity, donepezil and the other cholinesterase inhibitors are not curative. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Dopamine agonists (Choice B) increase dopamine signaling and therefore relieve parkinsonism. This patient does not demonstrate motor findings typical of Parkinson disease such as tremor, bradykinesia, or postural instability. NMDA receptor agonists (Choice C), such as endogenous glutamate, mediate activity-dependent synaptic changes of learning and memory. However, NMDA agonism is not a known drug mechanism because of the risk for excitotoxicity. NMDA receptor antagonists (Choice D), such as memantine, protect the brain from glutamate excitotoxicity. Patients with moderate to severe AD ( eg, a mini-menta l state examination score less than 18) may modestly benefit from memantine monotherapy if they cannot tolerate cholinesterase inhibitors. However, cholinesterase inhibitors are the first-line medications for AD of all severities, and this patient does not have moderate to severe dementia. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Choice E) increase synaptic serotonin activity and improve mood in patients with major depressive disorder. Major depressive disorder may cause cognitive impairment in older patients, which can improve with antidepressant treatment.

NMS is a life-threatening condition associated with the antagonism of dopamine that presents with altered mental status, muscle rigidity or tremor, hyperthermia, and autonomic dysfunction. Common causative agents are antipsychotics (especia lly high-potency antipsychotics Clinical Correct Answer: E. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is most likely in this patient who has received high-potency antipsychotic medication. NMS is a life-threatening condition associated with the antagonism of dopamine that presents with altered mental status, muscle rigidity or tremor, hyperthermia, and autonomic dysfunction. Common causative agents are antipsychotics (especia lly high-potency antipsychotics such as haloperidol) and antidopaminergic nausea medications. Rigidity and tremor result from dopamine antagonism in the nigrostriatal pathway, while autonomic dysfunction and hyperthermia may result from dopamine antagonism in the hypothalamus. Characteristic laboratory abnormalities include leukocytosis along with increased serum concentration of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase (as a result of prolonged muscle rigidity and consequent myolysis). Treatment is supportive and includes discontinuation of the offending medication, hydration, cooling blankets, and benzodiazepines if needed for agitation. Dantrolene is potentially beneficial.",

        "A": "related fever is unlikely in this patient. While some antibiotics can cause mild increases in body temperature, marked hyperthermia is not a common side effect of antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, this patient is not currently taking antibiotics. Herpes encephalitis (Choice B) presents with fever, altered mental status, and neurologic abnormalities, such as seizure, aphasia, hemiparesis, or cranial nerve deficits. Neuroimaging will typically demonstrate changes in the temporal lobe. Encephalitis is commonly associated with nuchal rigidity, which this patient does not demonstrate, making herpes encephalitis a less likely cause of his presentation. Additiona lly, an increased creatine kinase concentration is not consistent with herpes encephalitis. Lithium toxicity (Choice C) presents with nausea, vomiting, dysrhythmias, altered mental status, and neuromuscu lar excitability, such as tremors in acute toxicity. Chronic toxicity has more prominent neurologic symptoms and can also cause nephrogenic diabetes insipid us. Malignant hyperthermia (Choice D) is caused by a genetic defect in the ryanodine receptor and presents with muscle rigidity, tachycardia, fever, lactic acidosis, and hypercarbia when the patient is exposed to succinylcholine or volatile anesthetics. While the presentation is similar to NMS, this patient has not been exposed to agents that trigger malignant hyperthermia since his surgery, making this a less likely cause of his illness. Postoperative sepsis (Choice F) presents with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis, as well as hypotension and lactic acidosis if the patient is in septic shock, in the setting of a known or suspected infection. It is rarely associated with hypertension. Furthermore, this patient has no signs of infection on physical examination."

The distal motor neuropathy causes lower motor neuron signs such as atrophy of muscles and hyporeflexia, as shown in this patient. Microcytic anemia is also common, since lead inhibits the enzymes ferrochelatase and o-ALA dehydratase, resulting in decreased heme synthesis. In adults, exposure to lead primarily comes through occupation and/or hobbies. Individuals working with batteries, mining, construction , or ammunition are at higher risk. Illegally distilling alcohol has a risk for lead toxicity because of the leaching of lead from solder in the still, which is likely where this patient received exposure.

Patients typically present during an acute attack with psychosis, abdomina l pain, muscle weakness, neuropathy, and burgundy-colored urine. This patient's subacute presentation in the context of alcohol distillation is more consistent with lead poisoning. Alcohol abuse (Choice B) may cause peripheral neuropathy as a result of vitamin deficiency, but this more often manifests with gait instability than muscle weakness. Guillain-Barre syndrome (Choice C) is a demyelinating polyneuropathy that starts with the distal extremities and progresses proximally. It may affect the lungs through diaphragmatic paralysis, which is the most serious complication of the disease. Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson disease) (Choice D) is caused by decreased ceruloplasmin concentrations which cause excess copper to accumulate both inside and outside the liver. While the presentation is varied, some degree of liver disease is almost always seen at the time of diagnosis, which this patient does not demonstrate. Copper may deposit in the basal ganglia or diffusely in the brain. Neurologic symptoms include dysarthria, gait abnormalities, dystonia, tremor, parkinsonism, chorea, or athetosis.

Disease of the muscle (Choice B) such as polymyositis or muscular dystrophy may present with proximal muscle weakness.

Further, these diseases are not associated with the paraneoplastic production of antibodies. Disease of the peripheral nerve axon (Choice D) occurs in axonal polyneuropathy, a rare form of Guillain-Barre syndrome that involves the autoimmune attack of the spinal nerve root axons. Peripheral nerve demyelination (Choice E) occurs in Guillain-Barre syndrome, which results in destruction of the myelin on the spinal nerve roots.

MRI may demonstrate unilateral or bilateral white matter lesions without mass effect indicative of demyelination, which may progress to cortical atrophy. Lumbar puncture and cerebrospina l fluid analysis confirm the diagnosis. Treatment requires restarting antiretroviral therapy. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Central nervous system lymphoma (Choice A), or primary CNS lymphoma, is a rare variant of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs most commonly in immunocompromised patients. Typical presentation includes focal neurological deficits, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, positional headache, nausea, vomiting). MRI typically demonstrates a solitary mass lesion but can reveal multiple periventricular white matter mass lesions. Primary CNS lymphoma lesions do not involve demyelination and are more likely to produce a mass effect than PML lesions. Dementia, Alzheimer type (Choice B) results from decreased cholinergic signaling in the cortex and basal forebrain. Alzheimer dementia is the most prevalent dementia, presenting with progressive cognitive decline that culminates in the inability to perform basic activities of daily living. Alzheimer dementia is not associated with personality changes early in the disease course, demyelination, or . . 1mmunosuppress1on. Multiple sclerosis (Choice C) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease that presents with focal neurologic deficits separated in space and time. Cortical atrophy would be atypical, and multiple sclerosis is not associated with immunosuppression. Pick disease (Choice D), or frontotemporal dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, causing deficits in social behavior or personality along with dementia. Frontotemporal dementia is not associated with demyelination or immunosuppression."

Patients typically present with the subacute onset of focal neurologic deficits and cognitive impairment. MRI of the brain may demonstrate unilateral or bilateral white matter lesions indicative of demyelination and cortical atrophy Exam Section : Item 47 of 50 Clinical 4 7. A previously healthy 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of progressive weakness, numbness, and tingling of both arms. Her pulse is 70/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. Muscle strength is 3/5 in the upper extremities and 4/5 in the lower extremities. There is muscle wasting and atrophy of the forearms and hands bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are absent in the upper extremities and 4+ in the lower extremities. Babinski sign is present bilaterally. There is decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch in the upper extremities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis B) Guillain-Barre syndrome C) Postherpetic neuralgia D) Syringomyelia E) Tabes dorsalis Correct Answer: D. This patient presenting with an upper motor neuron pattern of dysfunction in the lower extremities and a lower motor neuron-pattern of dysfunction in the upper extremities likely has syringomyelia. Syringomyelia features a progressively expanding cystic lesion involving midline spinal cord structures. Syringomyelia may be associated with congenital malformations such as Chiari type I malformation, spinal cord infections, autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, neoplasms, or spinal cord trauma. Syringomyelia typically damages spinothalamic fibers decussating in the anterior white commissure. Consequent ly, patients present with deficits in pain and temperature sensation in the bilateral upper extremities (since the ascending spinothalamic tracts in the lateral spinal cord are unaffected, sensation in the lower body is intact). The spinothalamic tract also carries sensory fibers that mediate poorly localized light touch (versus localized light touch fibers of the posterior columns). The cystic lesion can expand to the bilateral anterior horns (the location of the cell bodies of lower motor neurons). Therefore, patients may also present with a lower motor neuron pattern of dysfunction in the bilateral upper extremities (eg, decreased muscle tone, hyporeflexia, early muscle atrophy). The cyst may also progressive ly expand to the lateral corticospinal tract in severe cases, leading to an upper motor neuron pattern of dysfunction (eg, spastic weakness, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski sign) in the lower body. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Choice A) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the anterior horns along with the lateral corticospinal tract as it descends in the brain and spinal cord. Subsequently, patients demonstrate a combination of upper and lower motor neuron findings in an asymmetric distribution that may include the bulbar muscles. Sensory impairment would be atypical, and a pattern of dysfunction that can be localized to a single lesion within the cervical spine is more consistent with syringomyelia. Guillain-Barre syndrome (Choice B) is an inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy that presents with acute-onset, ascending, j •",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Occlusion of the right posterior cerebral artery (PCA) explains this patient's deficits. The PCA supplies much of the occipital lobes as well as the inferomedial temporal lobe, posteromedial parietal lobe, thalamus, and parts of the brainstem. Visual symptoms are a prominent feature of a PCA territory infarction and include cortical blindness, contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing, visual agnosia, and prosopagnosia. Occlusion of the right PCA typically leads to left homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing (caused by damage of the right primary visual cortex) and may lead to left hemineglect (caused by damage of the right parietal cortex). Left homonymous hemianopia likely explains this patient's car accident and may lead to mild balance difficulties. Occlusion of the right PCA may also result in left hemisensory deficit (caused by thalamus damage) and left hemiparesis (caused by damage to the cerebral peduncles in the midbrain). Cerebral infarctions, also known as strokes, occur as a result of ischemic or hemorrhagic loss of blood supply to the brain. Approximately 80% to 85% of strokes are ischemic, commonly arising from thromboembolic disease (eg, middle cerebral artery occlusion from a thrombus), whereas 15% to 20% of strokes are hemorrhagic because of blood vessel rupture (eg, hypertension-related intraparenchymal hemorrhage from a perforating artery). Risk factors for stroke include smoking, hypertension, diabetes, carotid or intracranial atherosclerotic disease, history of hypercoagulabi lity, atrial fibrillation, and advanced age. Classically, strokes manifest as a neurologic deficit related to the affected part of the brain.",

A 72-year-old woman is brought to the physician 2 hours after the sudden onset of dim vision in her right eye. Her symptoms began 3 weeks ago with generalized stiffness, aches in the morning, and a bitemporal headache. Examination shows firm, tender temporal arteries bilaterally. Corrected visual acuity is 20/200 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left.

A) Carotid angiography now B) Aspirin therapy now and temporal artery biopsy within 24 hours C) Corticosteroid therapy now and temporal artery biopsy within 3 days D) Plasmapheresis now E) Temporal artery biopsy now with therapy determined by pathology Correct Answer: C. This patient's presenting findings of abrupt onset monocular vision loss, headache, stiffness, and temporal tenderness are consistent with a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is an autoimmune inflammatory vasculitis of medium and large vessels. Classic findings include systemic symptoms of fever, chills, and weight loss, headache, history of preceding transient vision loss (amaurosis fugax), jaw claudication, tenderness of the scalp, and pale optic disc edema. New headaches in an elderly patient should raise suspicion for GCA. GCA frequently occurs in association with polymyalgia rheumatica, which is characterized by stiffness of proximal muscles. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates increased inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein concentration, and thrombocytosis. GCA is characterized by a predilection for the vessels of the head and neck, and often affects the ophthalmic artery, inflammatory occlusion of which can result in sudden, ischemic damage to the retina. Once vision loss occurs it is not reversible and is commonly followed by vision loss in the contralateral eye within days or weeks. The diagnosis is confirmed with biopsy of the temporal artery demonstrating granulomatous vasculitis. Treatment with high dose corticosteroids should occur immediately once GCA is suspected in order to preserve vision. Corticosteroid treatment does not generally compromise biopsy results as long as the biopsy is performed within 1 to 2 weeks. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E. Carotid angiography (Choice A) is not a preferred diagnostic method for the detection of GCA. Temporal artery biopsy remains the standard diagnostic test. Steroid treatment should not be deferred while pursuing other tests Clinical Correct Answer: C.

Carotid angiography (Choice A) is not a preferred diagnostic method for the detection of GCA. Temporal artery biopsy remains the standard diagnostic test. Steroid treatment should not be deferred while pursuing other tests. Immediate aspirin therapy and temporal artery biopsy within 24 hours (Choice B) is incorrect. Aspirin does not provide a sufficiently robust anti-inflammatory effect to protect the ophthalmic artery from inflammation caused by GCA, which requires high-dose corticosteroids. Plasmapheresis (Choice D) is not commonly used for the treatment of GCA. GCA is characterized by granulomatous vasculitis and is therefore driven, at least in part, by a T lymphocyte and macrophage autoimmune response. Plasmapheresis is especially useful for the treatment of B lymphocyte driven autoimmune disorders, such as myasthenia gravis. Immediate temporal artery biopsy with treatment to be determined by pathology (Choice E) is not appropriate. Once the diagnosis of GCA is suspected, high-dose corticosteroid treatment should start immediately. Delaying initiation of corticosteroid therapy even by hours while awaiting biopsy results puts the patient at risk for preventable and irreversible blindness. Educational Objective: Giant cell arteritis is a common vasculitis of medium and large vessels in elderly patients and commonly presents with systemic symptoms, headache, jaw claudication, and proximal muscle stiffness. Vasculitis of the ophthalmic artery may occur and cause blindness.

They occur in women more often than men and are associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Patients may be asymptomatic or experience seizures or focal neurologic deficits related to the tumor location. Meningiomas are typically benign but can be malignant. Malignant meningiomas may grow rapidly, leading to symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (eg, postural headache, nausea, papilledema), or may metastasize. Meningiomas appear as well-circumscribed, extra-axia l (ie, outside of the brain parenchyma) masses that compress the parenchyma. They show uniform enhancement on imaging. Definitive diagnosis requires histologic examination of tissue, which will show spindle cells arranged in a whorled pattern with psammoma bodies.

Risk factors for hypertensive ICH include uncontrolled hypertension and antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, such as with aspirin or warfarin. Patients can present with headache, vomiting, confusion, altered mental status, stupor, or coma. Focal neurologic deficits depend on the site of the ICH and can include hemiparesis, hemisensory symptoms, gaze palsy, dysarthria, aphasia, or if in the cerebellum, ataxia, vomiting, and disequilibrium. Patients may manifest upper motoneuron examination findings such as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar reflex (Babinski sign).

It can cause spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in older adults, typically in a lobar location, because of the location of amyloid deposits in cortical vessels. In contrast, hypertensive hemorrhages typically occur in a deep location such as the putamen, thalamus, midbrain, or pons. lschemic cerebral infarction (Choice C) can occur as a result of thromboembol ic occlusion of cerebral arteries. Patients typically present with acute focal neurologic deficits, especially on one side of the body, and may have speech difficulty, dysarthria, or aphasia. A CT scan would not show hyperdense blood products unless the infarction is complicated by hemorrhagic conversion. Ruptured arteriovenous malformation (Choice D) can lead to intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Arteriovenous malformations are uncommon and usually present in individuals younger than 50 years old with intracranial hemorrhage, seizure, neurologic deficit, or headache, or may be an incidental finding. In an older patient with uncontrolled hypertension, a hypertensive intracerebral hematoma is more likely. Ruptured berry aneurysm (Choice E) typically leads to a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Patients typically present with an acute, severe headache (o ften described as the worst headache of the patient's life), along with neck stiffness, photophobia, and possible stupor or coma in severe cases.

Autonomic dysfunction may occur but is typically mild. Sensory deficits may occur (though these symptoms are typically mild compared to motor dysfunction). A slowing of conduction velocity on nerve conduction studies indicates demyelination and supports the diagnosis. The diagnosis is further supported by increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell counts on lumbar puncture, termed albuminocyto logic dissociation and thought to reflect generalized inflammation.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Multiple sclerosis (MS), the most prevalent immune-mediated demyelinating disease, may present with episodic or progressive neurologic dysfunction. According to the McDonald criteria for MS diagnosis, patients must have evidence of demyelinating lesions that are separated in time and location. This evidence is typically based on subjective symptoms and radiologic studies. Lesions affecting the left medial longitudina l fasciculus (leading to decreased medial gaze of the left eye), the prefronta l cortex or corticobulbar tracts (leading to pseudobu lbar affect, or uncontrollable crying), and the major central nervous system (CNS) tracts innervating the extremities (lesions of the corticospina l tract causing Babinski sign, spinothalamic tract causing decreased pinprick, dorsal column-media l lemniscus causing Romberg sign and paresthesia) are likely separated in space. This patient experienced two discrete periods of symptom onset at 6 months and 2 months, illustrating separation in time. MRI typically shows white matter hyperintensities in the periventricular region, cortex, subcortical region, cerebellum, or spine. Oligoclonal bands of immunog lobulins, indicating immune overactivation, can be found in the cerebrospinal fluid but are not necessary for diagnosis. Treatment includes corticosteroids for symptomatic management of acute flares and long-term disease-modifying treatments such as interferon or monoclonal antibodies.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "EEG assists in diagnosing seizures. Hypothalamic seizures can lead to uncontrollable crying. However, seizures typically last seconds to minutes; months of persistent sensory and motor dysfunction would be atypical. Measurement of serum ammonia concentration (Choice B) supports a diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy presents acutely with confusion or stupor along with neurologic symptoms such as asterixis, tremor, myoclonus, and frontal release signs. Measurement of serum calcium concentration (Choice C) would confirm hyper- or hypocalcemia. Hypercalcemia typically presents with confusion, fatigue, polyuria, constipation, and bone pain. Hypocalcemia features muscle spasms, paresthesias, circumoral numbness, and seizures. Measurement of serum copper concentration (Choice D) diagnoses Wilson disease, in which copper accumulates in the liver, brain, and eyes. Though mood swings and extrapyramidal symptoms (from copper deposits in the basal ganglia) may occur, months of medial gaze palsy along with sensorimotor dysfunction would be atypical. Measurement of serum vitamin B (cobalamin) concentration (Choice E) helps in diagnosing subacute combined degeneration, 12 affecting the spinocerebel lar tracts, lateral corticospina l tracts, and dorsal columns. Measurement of urine porphobilinogen concentration (Choice F) assists in diagnosing acute intermittent porphyria, which is characterized by episodic abdominal pain, polyneuropathy, psychologica l symptoms, and port wine-colored urine. Serum antinuclear antibody assay (Choice H) can assist in diagnosing autoimmune diseases affecting the CNS and are expressed at decreased concentrations in multiple sclerosis. However, characteristic MRI findings are more specific for MS. Venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test in cerebrospinal fluid (Choice I) assists in diagnosing neurosyphilis, which typically presents with progressive dementia or tabes dorsalis."

She is concerned that she might pass this condition on to her children. Her parents and three siblings do not have this disorder.

Neurofibromatosis type I is a genetically inherited disorder caused by a defect in NF1, the gene which encodes neurofibromin on chromosome 17. It follows an autosoma l dominant pattern of inheritance. It is characterized by a constellation of cutaneous manifestations (eg, neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas, cafe au lait spots, and axillary freckling), a variety of central nervous system tumors including optic nerve glioma and iris hamartoma (ie, Lisch nodule), and bony abnorma lities such as long bone dysplasia and sphenoid wing dysplasia. Patients are also at higher risk for developing astrocytomas, brainstem gliomas, and soft tissue sarcomas. Because it follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, only one alle le is needed to develop the condition. Thus, the chance of this patient passing on the dominant allele containing the mutation on chromosome 17 is 50% for each child. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. 25% for each child (Choice B) would be the chance of a child developing an autosoma l recessive disease if both his or her parents were carriers. The defect in NF1 that causes neurofibromatosis type I is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. 10% for each child (Choice C) could be the chance of a developing a disease which is controlled by several genes, or for which there is variable penetrance or expressivity, but neurofibromatosis type I is caused by a defect in a single gene, NF1, located on chromosome",

CRAO is a medical emergency, as it an ischemic stroke of the ophthalmic vasculature and indicates a high risk for associated ischemic stroke to the brain. Patients who present with CRAO should be admitted to a stroke center for emergent evaluation, including a search for a possible embolic source with echocardiography and duplex ultrasonography of the carotid arteries. A careful history and laboratory evaluation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum concentration of C-reactive protein, and platelet count should be performed to evaluate for possible GCA.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis is the most likely diagnosis in this 10-day old infant with new onset seizures, a normal head CT scan, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showing increased protein and leukocyte count with a low-normal glucose concentration, which is consistent with aseptic (nonbacterial) meningitis. Further suggestive is the presence of erythrocytes in the CSF which is often seen in herpetic encephalitis. Most cases of HSV encephalitis are caused by HSV-2, although infection with HSV-1 occurs and is treated in the same way. Most patients acquire the virus via transmission from the mother, often during the third trimester, with encephalitis developing usually within a week. Symptoms are nonspecific and include fever, lethargy, poor feeding, and occasionally seizures or focal neurologic deficits. Concomitant oral lesions may occur, but their absence does not rule out the diagnosis. The CSF findings include increased protein, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and a normal or low-normal glucose concentration. In many instances the causative virus can be identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the CSF, although empiric therapy with intravenous acyclovir is warranted prior to diagnosis. Failure to recognize and treat infection can result in organ dysfunction and death, or long-term neurologic sequelae.",

The patient lacks these other features. lntracranial calcifications may be present on CT scan. Congenital infection with syphilis (Choice B) presents typically within five weeks with hepatomegaly, maculopapular rash, rhinitis, and skeletal abnormalities including periostitis or bone demineralization. CSF findings may show pleocytosis and increased protein but would be positive for Treponema pal/idum. Congenital infection with toxoplasmosis (Choice C) may present with chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and seizures. Toxoplasma gondii can be detected in the CSF. lntracranial calcifications may be present on CT scan. Neonatal Escherichia coli meningitis (Choice D) may present with fever, lethargy, and hypotonia, and CSF findings would include a neutrophilic pleocytosis with a decreased glucose concentration. Treatment is with ampicillin if the organism is sensitive, or with a cephalosporin combined with gentamicin. Neonatal group B streptococcus (GBS) meningitis (Choice E) presents similarly to E. coli meningitis but is more common in patients born to mothers who are colonized with GBS who have not received prophylactic treatment. Colonization is usually detected and treated prior to delivery, and if the status is unknown, prophylactic antibiotics are given."

A 67-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of a 1-month history of deafness, ringing in both ears, dizziness, and difficulty with balance. He also has had an occasiona l sensation that the room is spinning. He was discharged from the hospital 21 days ago after prolonged treatment for pneumonia and sepsis with intravenous ceftriaxone and gentamicin. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure. He has a history of tuberculosis 10 years ago. Medications include digoxin, metformin, and losartan. His pulse is 84/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg. Examination shows nystagmus on lateral gaze bilaterally. There is severe loss of hearing bilaterally. Air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Results of Weber test are normal. Muscle strength, deep tendon reflexes, and sensory findings are normal. His gait is broad-based, and he is unable to walk in tandem. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicit~ B) Cerebellopontine angle tumor C) Meniere disease D) Pontine infarction E) Vestibular neuronitis Correct Answer: A. Ototoxicity is a frequent adverse effect of aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin, which exert bactericidal effects by binding the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Aminoglycosides accumulate in the inner ear endolymph and perilymph, and can cause cochlear ototoxicity and vestibulotoxicity, which is typically irreversible. The risk for ototoxicity associated with aminoglycosides may be as high as 10% in some patient populations. While there is an increased risk for ototoxicity with repeat dosing or with high doses, ototoxicity may occur with even the first dose of aminoglycoside. While aminoglycosides are high ly effective against a broad range of Gram-negative bacterial infections, such as with Escherichia coli, Klebsiel/a, Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Serratia species, their use is limited by their significant adverse effects. In addition to ototoxicity and vestibulotoxicity, aminoglycosides are also associated with nephrotoxicity. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Cerebellopontine angle tumor (Choice B), such as an acoustic neuroma, meningioma, or glioma, typically affects the vestibulococh lear nerve and other cranial nerves (eg, trigeminal, abducens, facial nerves). Patients may present with hearing loss and vertigo; sensory and motor dysfunction of the face and/or extraocular muscles are also possible. Meniere disease (Choice C) is a condition of episodic vertigo and sensorineural hearing loss that results from pressure accumulation in the endolymph of the inner ear. This patient's lack of episodic symptoms suggests against this diagnosis.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Carbidopa-levodopa is a dopamine agonist used to treat Parkinson disease by increasing the amount of dopamine available in the nigrostriatal pathway. Carbidopa and levodopa are given together in order to increase availability of levodopa to the brain. Levodopa is converted to dopamine by the enzyme dopa decarboxylase in the peripheral circulation and the brain. Dopamine is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), so any levodopa which is converted to dopamine peripherally is unable to effect change in the basal ganglia. Carbidopa indirectly increases dopamine availability in the basal ganglia by inhibiting dopa decarboxylase peripherally. In this way, more levodopa is able to cross the BBB and be converted to dopamine in the brain, where it is then able to act on the nigrostriatal pathway. Increased dopamine leads to improvement of Parkinson disease symptoms including the tremor, rigidity, akinesia, and postural instability shown by this patient.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Methylphenidate is a non-amphetamine central nervous system stimulant medication that is used in the treatment of narcolepsy, which is the most likely diagnosis in this patient with fatigue and episodes of cataplexy. Methylphenidate works by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into presynaptic neurons. The pathogenesis of narcolepsy involves the loss of orexin-A and orexin-B, which are neurotransmitters found primarily in the hypothalamus that promote wakefulness and inhibit rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Loss of these neurotransmitters permits abnormal transition from wakefulness to REM sleep with subsequent development of hallucinations and other features of narcolepsy including cataplexy and sleep paralysis. Diagnosis can be made in patients with daytime somnolence and cataplexy or, in cases where cataplexy is not present, with sleep latency testing. Polysomnography is appropriate to support the diagnosis and to rule out similar sleep-related conditions such as sleep apnea. Occasionally patients undergo lumbar puncture to directly measure concentrations of orexin-A in the cerebrospinal fluid, but this is generally not required for the diagnosis. Pharmacotherapy is directed at promoting wakefulness, and methylphenidate is one relatively safe and effective stimulant used to do this.",

Focal neurologic deficits that start in one area of the body and spread are suggestive of partial seizure activity. Without an alteration in level of consciousness, this would be defined as a simple partial seizure manifesting with sensory symptoms, also called a simple partial somatosensory seizure. This type of seizure is most commonly associated with lesions of the parietal lobe as a result of the involvement of the primary somatosensory cortex, which processes sensory input from the contralatera l side of the body.

Depression is a common complication of Parkinson disease. Since this patient's depression began after his Parkinson disease diagnosis, his depression is likely a result of Parkinson disease and should be diagnosed as depressive disorder caused by another medical condition. Many patients with this diagnosis improve once the medical condition resolves. Since Parkinson disease does not remit, the depression should be treated pharmacologically. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are first-line medications for patients with major depressive disorder and are frequent ly utilized for patients with comorbid Parkinson disease and major depressive disorder because of their effectiveness and low risk for adverse effects. However, serotonergic medications are not effective for smoking cessation. Bupropion is an antidepressant medication that increases the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine (which targets depressive symptoms) and antagonizes the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (which targets tobacco use). Bupropion can increase blood pressure, so this patient with a history of hypertension should have his blood pressure monitored closely.",

Patients who are intolerant or refractory to pharmacotherapy should be considered for deep brain stimulation. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Major depressive disorder (Choice B) is diagnosed when patients meet criteria established in the DSM-5 including impaired sleep (either insomnia or hypersomnolence), loss of interest, guilt, loss of energy, poor concentration, poor appetite, psychomotor retardation, or suicidal ideation. This patient does not meet the criteria. Multi-infarct (vascular) dementia (Choice C) presents frequently with a stepwise decline in cognitive performance over several years and occurs as a result of cumulative damage from many small ischemic strokes. It does not present with hallucinations. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (Choice D) classically presents with enlarged ventricles on imaging with normal opening pressure on lumbar puncture, dementia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence. Progression of Parkinson disease (Choice E) is a possibility in this patient as evidenced by her worsening bradykinesia, but this is less likely to be the cause of her hallucinations than the time-correla ted effect of increasing the doses of medications with known hallucinogenic adverse effects."

CO is a byproduct of combustion. When inhaled, it avidly crosses the pulmonary capillary membrane and tightly binds hemoglobin, inducing a conformationa l change in the molecule and preventing the binding of oxygen. CO has an affinity for hemoglobin that is hundreds of times greater than that of oxygen, readily displacing oxygen from heme. CO also has affinity with the mitochondrial electron transport chain, thus, in addition to hypoxemia resulting from interference with oxygen carrying capacity, cells may not be able to make use of the oxygen that they do receive via aerobic metabolism. As a result, anaerobic metabolism dominates, and lactic acidosis caused by hypoxia ensues. Symptoms of CO poisoning include headache, loss of consciousness, dizziness, vomiting, and fatigue; in severe cases, seizures, dysrhythmias, coma, and death may occur. Examination may show red skin. Treatment for CO poisoning begins with the administration of 100% oxygen regardless of pulse oximetry readings, and if any neurologic symptoms or signs of end-organ dysfunction are present, as in this case, hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be indicated.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Toxop/asma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite. Transmission can occur through the ingestion of oocysts from cat feces or infected meat, direct transmission between a mother and fetus, or from organ transplantation, which leads to invasion followed by dissemination of the parasite where it typically lies dormant. It is a ubiquitous organism and nearly 10% of individuals will be seropositive for T gondii, but the parasite does not usually cause severe disease in immunocompetent individuals. In patients with HIV infection and CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/mm 3, however, reactivation can occur with several distinct clinical syndromes of which cerebral toxoplasmosis results in the most morbidity. Cerebral toxoplasmosis typically presents with multiple ring enhancing lesions scattered throughout the brain. Seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and systemic symptoms are common, as are signs of increased intracranial pressure. Patients with HIV infection and positive Toxop/asma lgG antibodies are typically treated empirically with a sulfonamide and pyrimethamine if cerebral toxoplasmosis is suspected, but confirmatory diagnosis occurs through a brain biopsy, which will show a dense infiltrate of lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells, along with the presence of the T gondii organism. Cerebral toxoplasmosis is an AIDS-defining disease.",

Focal neurologic deficits and mass lesions on neuroimaging are rare.",
        "B": "Cysticercosis is caused by Taenia so/ium and presents with headache, seizures, and increased intracranial pressure. Neuroimaging will show cystic, ring-enhancing, calcified lesions in the brain parenchyma, meninges, ventricles, spinal cord, and/or orbit. It less commonly presents with focal neurologic deficits such as those seen in this patient. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (Choice C) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs in immunocomp romised patients and presents with focal neurologic deficits, vision changes, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and increased intracranial pressure. It appears similar to toxoplasmosis on neuroimaging but is much less common than toxoplasmos is. If this patient failed to improve with pyrimethamine and sulfonamide therapy, central nervous system lymphoma would be the likely diagnosis. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (Choice D) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by human polyomavirus 2 (formerly JC virus), most commonly in immunocompromised patients. It presents subacutely with altered mental status, ataxia, vision changes, and hemiparesis.

It is generally caused by vertebral bony metastases that tend to occur in the vertebral body, particularly of the thoracic spine. Its presentation depends on the level of the lesion and the degree of spinal cord compression. Symptoms include back pain, which is often worse at night or with lying down, muscle weakness, sensory abnormalities, bladder or bowel dysfunction, and gait instability. It will generally present with an upper motoneuron pattern of injury in the lower extremities with hyperreflexia and positive Babinski signs, as in this patient, assuming the compression is in the thoracic or upper lumbar region. Ascending numbness or paresthesias are also common. Diagnosis is classically made utilizing MRI of the spine. Patients may be treated with glucocorticoids, radiation therapy, and/or surgical decompression and spine stabilization.",

        "A": "induced polyneuropathy classically presents with sensory loss and paresthesias in the distal extremities that ascend in a \"stocking and glove\" pattern. Most chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy will improve over time after chemotherapy is stopped, making this a less likely explanation for this patient's acute onset of symptoms. Guillain-Barre syndrome (Choice B) is caused by autoimmune-mediated nerve destruction following a systemic infection, such as Campy/obacter jejuni. It classically presents with ascending paralysis with absent deep tendon reflexes that begins in the lower extremities. It can also ascend to involve the upper extremities, diaphragm, and cranial nerves in some patients.",
        "D": "Myopathy is caused by a disorder affecting the muscle itself, rather than the nerves that innervate it. Generally, it presents with symmetric proximal muscle weakness in response to genetic metabolic abnormalities, toxins (eg, alcohol or medications), endocrine dysfunction (eg, hypothyroidism), or inflammation. It does not present with sensory changes. Paraneoplastic neuropathy (Choice E) is an immune-mediated destruction of neuronal tissue in the presence of an underlying malignancy. It can present in a variety of ways, such as an acute sensorimotor radiculopathy, chronic sensorimotor neuropathy, or autonomic neuropathy. This patient's symptoms would be most similar to an acute sensorimotor radiculopathy, but this syndrome presents with a predominant ascending motor paralysis."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) refers to bleeding into the subarachnoid space and can be caused by aneurysmal or non-aneurysma l rupture of an artery in the subarachnoid space. Patients typically present with an acute, severe headache (often described as the worst headache of their life), along with neck stiffness, photophobia, and possible stupor or coma in severe cases. Fever can be associated with SAH and is associated with worse outcomes. CT scan of the head typically shows hyperdense blood products in the cerebral sulci and basal cisterns. However, the sensitivity of CT scan for SAH is lower with small volume bleeding or a delayed presentation. If there is strong suspicion for SAH with a negative CT scan, a lumbar puncture can be performed, which may show red blood cells or xanthochromia, which represents hemoglobin degradation products. As the blood products circulate within the subarachnoid space, complications include the development of communicating and/or obstructive hydrocephalus in the acute stage, along with the potential for re-bleeding and vasospasm in the days following the initial bleed.

Carotid ultrasonography (Choice C) is frequently used for the evaluation of atherosclerosis at the carotid arteries. Carotid artery atherosclerosis increases risk for ischemic stroke as plaque breakage can travel to and cause blockage within cerebral arteries. This patient does not have focal neurologic deficits or imaging indicating an ischemic stroke, so carotid ultrasonography would not be the next step in management. MRI of the brain (Choice D) would be indicated for evaluation of ischemic stroke or tumor. The patient does not display any focal neurologic symptoms or aphasia to suggest an ischemic stroke. Tumors can also cause headaches, but typically chronic or subacute headaches, associated with vomiting and papilledema."

A 72-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 6 hours after the onset of double vision, loss of balance, and dizziness. She has no history of similar symptoms. She sustained a myocardial infarction 2 months ago. She has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include insulin and clonidine. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37.1 °C (98.8°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg in both arms. A left carotid bruit is heard. Pulses are decreased in the lower extremities. Atherosclerotic involvement of which of the following arteries is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? A) Brachiocephalic B) Common carotid C) External carotid D) Internal carotid E) Middle cerebral F) Subclavian G) Vertebral Correct Answer: G. This patient likely has an occlusion of the vertebral artery leading to vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency can be caused by ischemia in patients with poor sympathetic regulation or thromboembolism commonly originating from an atherosclerotic plaque in or dissection of a vertebral artery (known as a posterior circulation stroke). Risk factors for posterior circulation strokes include smoking, hypertension, age, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and peripheral artery disease (as evidenced by this patient's diminished lower extremity pulses). The brain stem, cerebellum, and occipital lobes are commonly affected. Patients typically present with vestibulocerebel lar signs (eg, ataxia, dysmetria, dizziness, imbalance, vertigo, vomiting, nystagmus), ipsilateral cranial nerve dysfunction (eg, dysphagia, dysarthria, vertical or horizontal gaze palsies), contralatera l hemiparesis (caused by corticospinal tract damage), contralateral impairment in pain and temperature sensation (caused by spinothalamic tract damage), and/or contralateral homonymous hemianopsia with macular sparing (caused by posterior cerebral artery involvement). Unlike hemispheric strokes arising from the internal carotid arteries, cortical deficits such as cognitive and speech impairment are typically absent. A noncontrast CT scan of the head rules out hemorrhage, and the diagnosis may be confirmed with vessel imaging if the lesion is sufficiently large. If no hemorrhage is seen, acute management of posterior circulation strokes may involve tissue plasminogen activator therapy or thrombectomy. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, E, and F. The brachiocephalic artery (Choice A) supplies the arm, head, and neck. Atherosclerotic disease and consequent occlusion of the brachiocephalic artery may lead to neck and upper extremity pain in addition to signs of vertebrobasilar insufficiency that are exacerbated on exercise Clinical Correct Answer: G.

The brachiocephalic artery (Choice A) supplies the arm, head, and neck. Atherosclerotic disease and consequent occlusion of the brachiocephalic artery may lead to neck and upper extremity pain in addition to signs of vertebrobasilar insufficiency that are exacerbated on exercise. Common carotid artery (Choice B) occlusion from atherosclerotic disease less frequently causes symptoms because of retrograde collateral flow through the external carotid artery. If a stroke were to occur, it would affect the ipsilateral anterior and middle cerebral arterial territory, which would not result in signs of vertebrobasilar insufficiency. External carotid artery (Choice C) occlusion from atherosclerotic disease typically does not produce symptoms but may lead to an ocular ischemic syndrome. The internal carotid artery (Choice D) supplies the middle cerebral artery (Choice E), which supplies the lateral frontal and anterolateral parietal lobes. During acute occlusion of the internal carotid artery (typically as a result of a thrombus induced by atherosclerotic disease) or middle cerebral artery (typically related to an embolus from the internal carotid artery), patients may present with hemiparesis and hemisensory deficit (predominantly of the contralateral face and upper body), along with speech impairment. The subclavian artery (Choice F) supplies the upper extremity and gives rise to the vertebral artery. Atherosclerotic disease and occlusion of the subclavian artery usually presents with upper extremity fatigability, claudication, and/or rest pain along with symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency that are exacerbated by exercise. This patient lacks upper extremity symptoms or activity-related variability of symptoms Clinical plaque in or dissection of a vertebral artery (known as a posterior circulation stroke).

However, lumbosacra l strain will not cause perinea! anesthesia or neuromuscular weakness. Cauda equina is a surgical emergency, making physical therapy an incorrect initial next step. Bed rest and analgesic therapy (Choice C) is no longer recommended for back pain, as it can lead to prolonged pain, as well as worsened muscle and bone strength. It would certainly not be appropriate in cauda equina syndrome, as delayed surgical decompression can lead to permanent neurologic deficits. Intravenous administration of muscle relaxants (Choice D) may provide symptomatic relief in lumbosacral strain or other muscular disorders. Patients with cauda equina may similarly gain some symptomatic relief. However, the more pertinent next step in this patient is lumbar laminectomy to prevent permanent neurologic dysfunction."

Vertebrobasi lar insufficiency can be caused by ischemia in patients with poor sympathetic regulation or thromboembolism common ly originating from an atherosclerotic plaque in or dissection of the vertebra l artery (known as a posterior circulation stroke). A thrombus of the vertebral artery commonly forms from atherosclerotic disease but may also form as a result of an intimal defect from trauma or vertebra l artery dissection, a known complication of chiropractic manipu lation. The brain stem, cerebellum, and occipital lobes are common ly affected. Patients typically present with vestibu locerebe llar signs (eg, ataxia, dysmetria, dizziness, imbalance, vertigo, vomiting, nystagmus), ipsilateral cranial nerve dysfunction (eg, dysphagia, dysarthria, vertical or horizonta l gaze palsies), contralateral hemiparesis (caused by corticospinal tract damage), contralateral impairment in pain and temperature sensation (caused by spinothalamic tract damage), and/or contralateral homonymous hemianopsia with macular sparing (caused by posterior cerebral artery involvement). In posterior circulation strokes affecting the lateral pons, Horner syndrome may occur, which presents with unilateral ptosis and miosis (pupillary constriction) and ipsilateral facial anhidrosis. If no hemorrhage is shown on noncontrast CT scan of the head, acute management of posterior circulation strokes may involve tissue plasminogen activator therapy or thrombectomy.

All patients with suspected concussion should undergo a thorough neurologic examination, and a subset of at-risk patients should receive neuroimaging. All patients should be monitored closely for neurologic deterioration, which may indicate a developing intracranial hem1atoma. To prevent cumulative brain injury (eg, from a second concussion), patients with concussion should return to their usual activities in a graded fashion, beginning with the return to school and without return to sports until cleared by a physician. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, E, and F. A cervical spine fracture (Choice B) could present with neck pain, altered mental status, focal neurologic deficits, and decreased neck mobility. Closed head injury (Choice C) refers to blunt head trauma with no object penetrating the skull and dura mater, and encompasses a variety of injuries, such as hematomas, skull fractures, intracranial hemorrhage, or traumatic brain injury. This patient lost consciousness momentarily and has no other apparent neurologic deficits, making concussion a more specific diagnosis. Epidural hematoma (Choice D) classically occurs after injury to the middle meningeal artery and can present with an initial lucid interval followed by deterioration of mental status as a result of arterial bleeding and hematoma expansion. Epidural hematomas present on CT scan as lens-shaped, bi-convex hyperdense collections abutting the skull. Facial bone fracture (Choice E) can occur as a result of direct blunt trauma to the face and can be associated with pain and ecchymosis. Patients can present with a variety of signs or symptoms depending on which facial bone is fractured, including facial deformity, midface instability, malocclusion, nerve entrapment, or diplopia. A frontal skull fracture (Choice F) is uncommon as a result of the hardness of the bone, but can occur after severe, high-impact blunt head injury and can be associated with intracranial bleeding. It can present with swelling, tenderness, a palpable skull defect or crepitus, and can be associated with altered mental status."

Tuberculous meningitis typically presents with nuchal rigidity, fever, and altered mental status, similar to the symptoms seen in bacterial meningitis. However, unlike bacterial meningitis which presents acutely, tuberculous meningitis typically shows a subacute presentation. Presence of cranial nerve palsies is also more likely in tuberculous meningitis than bacterial meningitis. Physical examination may show a positive Kernig or Brudzinski sign, indicative of meningeal irritation. Results of laboratory studies will show nonspecific changes including leukocytosis and mild anemia. A tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay are usually positive, but a negative result is also possible. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation is the initial diagnostic step and will reveal an increased opening pressure, increased white blood cell count with prominent lymphocytes, increased protein concentration, and decreased glucose concentration. Culture of the CSF for acid-fast bacilli may be positive, though the sensitivity of this test for tuberculous meningitis is less than 50%.

It is a CYP450 inducer, which may increase hepatic clearance of some medications (eg, warfarin, phenytoin, valproic acid), leading to subtherapeutic concentrations in the serum. Other drugs, such as erythromycin, can interfere with the hepatic metabolism of carbamazepine by inhibiting CYP450 enzymes, leading to decreased carbamazepine clearance, increased serum concentration, and toxicity. Carbamazepine toxicity typically presents with altered mental status, drowsiness, ataxia, nystagmus, nausea, and vomiting. Diagnosis can be made by measuring a serum carbamazepine concentration above therapeutic levels, and there is a dose-dependent effect on neurologic depression.

It presents acutely with unilateral facial paralysis that includes the forehead, consistent with its lower motoneuron pathologic involvement. It can also be associated with loss of taste on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and decreased lacrimation. Symptoms typically peak around 3 weeks, with slow recovery beginning within 6 months. Diagnosis is most commonly based on clinical symptoms, but electrodiagnostic tests, such as EMG, and imaging of the face and head can be utilized if the diagnosis is unclear. Initial treatment consists of oral glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, and antiviral therapy in severe cases.",

The patient's symptoms are best explained by lumbar spinal stenosis. Spinal stenosis describes narrowing of the central canal, neural foramen, or lateral recesses of the spine with consequent nerve compression. Common causes include degenerative arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, degenerative disc disease, hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum, and osteophyte formation in the facet joints. Lower back pain with radiation to the buttocks and lower extremities that results from increased nerve compression is called neurogenic claudication. It is exacerbated by extension of the spine during standing and walking downhill. Lengthening the spinal column with spinal flexion as during sitting, walking uphill, or bending forward tends to relieve the pain. The absence of ankle reflexes suggests involvement of the S 1 nerve root. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E.

Pain is typically worse when sitting down or walking uphill. Physical examination would show localized tenderness over the sacroiliac joint. Trochanteric bursitis (Choice E) classically presents with lateral! hip pain that is exacerbated by activity. Physical examination shows point tenderness over the greater trochanter and increased pain with external rotation of the hip as a result of compression of the bursa."

        "A": "Bursitis is inflammation of one or more bursae and is manifested by pain and swelling over a single joint. Some examples include the subacromial bursa which can cause pain in the shoulder, the trochanteric bursa which can cause pain over the lateral aspect of the hip, and the olecranon bursa which can cause pain and swelling posterior to the elbow. When inflamed or injured, fluid can collect inside the potential space of the bursa causing swelling, which can be appreciated on examination as a fluctuant, tender, circumscribed mass. Muscle stiffness is not a typical feature.",
        "B": "Dermatomyositis and polymyositis (Choice E) are autoimmune inflammatory myopathies characterized by muscle weakness, rather than stiffness, of the proximal muscles. Dermatomyositis additionally demonstrates cutaneous findings including a light pink- or heliotrope-colored rash on the eyelids and Gottron papules on the dorsal fingers. Unlike PMR, fibromyalgia (Choice C) affects middle-aged women at various anatomica l sites in conjunction with anxiety, stress, and point tenderness. ESR is normal. This patient's limited involvement to the pelvic and hip girdles along with other inflammatory symptoms including generalized weakness, malaise, and fever suggest a diagnosis of PMR over fibromya lgia. Rheumatoid arthritis (Choice F) is a common autoimmune disease characterized by joint destruction, pain, and upregulation of immunomodulatory cytokines. Muscle pain and stiffness are not typical features."

Low-dose prednisone is the treatment of choice Exam Section : Item 10 of 50 Clinical 'f 10. A 57-year-o ld woman comes to the physician because of daily headaches for 8 months. The headaches are localized to the right temple and usually worsen throughout the day. At times, the headaches are exacerbated by chewing. She has a history of migraines but has not had one since menopause 6 years ago. She recently divorced and is under a great deal of stress at work. She has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years. Her temperatu re is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 144/86 mm Hg. Examination shows pain with movement of the jaw and tenderness under the right zygoma tic arch. The nasal mucosa is normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 20 mm/h. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Bacterial meningitis B) Cluster headache C) Migraine D) Sinusitis E) Temporal arteritis F) Temporomandibu lar joint syndrome G) Tension-type headache H) Trigeminal neuralgia Correct Answer: F. The temporomandibu lar joint (TMJ) forms the articulation between the mandibular condyle and the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone. TMJ syndrome occurs because of a combination of structural damage to the TMJ and a variety of neurologic and psychological factors related to pain and stress. Patients usually present with unilatera l, dull, occasionally sharp or stabbing pain near the TMJ or anterior to the auricle that is exacerbated by chewing or jaw clenching. Patients may also experience popping or clicking sensations associated with movement of the jaw and a decreased range of jaw motion. Treatment includes physical therapy, cognitive behavior therapy or biofeedback therapy to treat underlying stress, and pharmacologic therapy including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or tricyclic antidepressants. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, E, G, and H. Bacterial meningitis (Choice A) presents with fever and signs of meningeal irritation (nausea, irritability, confusion, anorexia, headache, and nuchal rigidity). This patient's absence of fever and meningismus renders this diagnosis unlikely.

Migraines (Choice C) are a common cause of headache in adult patients. They may present with visual aura of scintillating scotoma or fortification spectra but are not associated with focal tenderness of the jaw or pain with chewing. Sinusitis (Choice D) may be associated with bilateral, pressure-like, periorbital headaches and nasal congestion. Patients may experience focal tenderness and tenderness to percussion overlying the affected sinus (typically overlying the brow or maxilla) but rarely experience focal jaw tenderness overlying the TMJ. Temporal arteritis (Choice E), also known as giant cell arteritis, is a vasculitis of medium and large vessels in elderly patients and commonly presents with systemic symptoms, headache, jaw claudication, proximal muscle stiffness, and sudden, irreversible vision loss. This patient's chronic course, lack of associated systemic symptoms, and normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate render this diagnosis less likely. Tension-type headache (Choice G) typically presents with bilateral dull, pressure-like or band-like pain across the bilateral frontal and temporal areas. It does not tend to present with focal tenderness of the jaw or pain with chewing. Trigeminal neuralgia (Choice H), also known as tic douloureux, presents with brief, recurrent, sudden episodes of pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve.

Atrial fibrillation is a major independent risk factor for strokes, and stroke prevention is an essential aspect of management. The loss of coordinated atrial contraction in this dysrhythmia results in blood stasis within the atrial compartment and promotion of thrombus formation. Embolism to the cerebral arteries results in ischemic stroke. The presence of right-sided hemiplegia and expressive dysphasia are suggestive of a lesion involving the left middle cerebral artery distribution. The middle cerebral arteries are the most common cerebral arteries involved in acute thromboembolic stroke.",

A 77-year-old man is brought to the physician by his daughter because he has become increasingly forgetful during the past 6 months. His daughter states that his short-term memory is quite impaired, and he says that he is frustrated with his memory. He lives alone and is able to perform activities of daily living independently. On questioning, he reports a 1-month history of a mild nonproductive cough, constipation, mild pain in his hips with movement, mild numbness of the toes of both feet, and a few episodes of urinary incontinence. He has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and aspirin. His wife died 6 years ago. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 128/72 mm Hg. Muscle strength is normal. Cranial nerves are intact. Deep tendon reflexes are normal. Sensation to vibration is mildly decreased over the distal lower extremities. Proprioception is intact. His gait is wide based, and he has impaired tandem walking. His Mini-Mental State Examination score is 24/30; he recalls one of three objects after 5 minutes. An MRI of the brain shows slightly enlarged ventricles with minimal cortical atrophy. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Recommendation that the patient move to an assisted living community B) Discontinuation of atorvastatin therapy C) Discontinuation of metformin therapy D) Addition of donepezil therapy E) Addition of paroxetine therapy F) Lumbar puncture ~- Correct Answer: F. The patient is presenting with findings concerning for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), with the characteristic combination of dementia (eg, frontal executive dysfunction), gait instability, and urinary incontinence. NPH refers to a type of communicating (nonobstructive) hydrocephalus in which the ventricles are enlarged, leading to damage of the white matter tracts connecting the frontal lobes and basal ganglia. Signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, papilledema, postural headaches) are typically absent. Many cases of NPH are idiopathic, though some are secondary to a defect in cerebrospinal fluid drainage from the ventricles as a result of scarring or obstruction of the ventricular lining from prior hemorrhage or meningitis. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, although ventriculomegaly on brain imaging is suggestive. The most appropriate next step in management is a lumbar puncture to assess the opening pressure and clinical response to removing cerebrospinal fluid. Placement of a ventricular shunt may be needed for long-term management. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, and E. Recommendation that the patient move to an assisted living community (Choice A) is inappropriate prior to a thorough evaluation for intervenable causes. Recovery of executive function in patients with NPH that has progressed to dementia is uncertain. It may be appropriate to refer to assisted living if the patient continues to decline and is unable to manage activities of daily living. . r ~- - - , r - - - , Clinical Please Walt F) Lumbar puncture Correct Answer: F.

Recovery of executive function in patients with NPH that has progressed to dementia is uncertain. It may be appropriate to refer to assisted living if the patient continues to decline and is unable to manage activities of daily living. Discontinuation of atorvastatin therapy (Choice B) and discontinuation of metformin therapy (Choice C) may be considered later in the patient's course depending on the degree of recovery. Medications that confer long-term benefits are often discontinued in patients with progressive dementia or life-limiting conditions to avoid unnecessary side effects and pill burden. Addition of donepezil therapy (Choice D) may be considered in the future if the patient's cognitive symptoms do not improve. The next best initial step in management for this patient is to perform a lumbar puncture and assess his clinical response to the removal of cerebrospinal fluid. Addition of paroxetine therapy (Choice E) would not be indicated currently. Cognitive impairment and memory disturbances may be manifestations of depression, especially in older adults, and patients should be screened for depression as part of the initial evaluation. Initiating an antidepressant would not be appropriate at this time. Educational Objective: The triad of cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence, and gait instability should raise concern for normal pressure hydrocephalus. Initial evaluation should include neuroimaging and a lumbar puncture to assess the patient's opening pressure and clinical response to the removal of cerebrospinal fluid Exam Section : Item 14 of 50 Clinical \"t 14. A previously healthy 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of intermittent pain and tingling that radiates from his right shoulder blade to his right thumb and index finger. These symptoms worsen with coughing and sneezing. There is no history of neck, shoulder, or arm injury. His pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnorma lities. The cranial nerves are intact. Muscle strength is normal in all extremities. Deep te ndon reflexes are 1 + in the right biceps muscle and 2+ elsewhere. Babinski sign is absent. Sensation to pinprick is decreased over the dorsal aspect of the right thumb and index finger. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's symptoms? A) Brachia! plexus compression G) Median nerve compress ion at the wrist B) Central nervous system compression H) Radial nerve compression at the elbow C) Central nervous system demyelination I) Radial nerve compression at the spiral groove D) Central nervous system ischemia J) Ulnar nerve compression at the elbow E) Cervical nerve root compression K) Ulnar nerve compression at the wrist F) Median nerve compress ion at the elbow Correct Answer: E. Cervical nerve root compression explains this patient's symptoms of cervical radiculopathy. Radiculopathy refers to pathology affecting a specific spinal nerve root that leads to weakness, numbness, paresthesias, and pain in the dermatomal and myotomal distribution that correlates to the affected root. C6 radiculopathy will result in pain that radiates from the neck into the arm along with decreased sensation, pain, and/or paresthesia in the lateral forearm and the lateral two digits. Additional ly, C6 radiculopathy causes motor dysfunction of elbow flexion and wrist extension, and a diminished or absent biceps reflex. Radiculopathy symptoms may worsen with activities that increase pressure such as coughing and sneezing. Radiculopathy may be caused by spondylosis (degenerative changes of the spine), disc herniation, infection, tumor, demyelination, or infarction. Dermatomes and myotomes are components of the embryonic somite, a paired segment of paraxial mesoderm. When fully developed, the dermatome is an area of skin whose afferent fibers travel within a single spinal nerve, and myotome is a group of muscles innervated by the efferent fibers from a single spinal nerve. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, and K. Brachia! plexus compression (Choice A) typically presents with weakness, numbness, and/or paresthesias of the majority of the upper extremity. Brachia! plexus compression typical ly affects multiple nerve roots and motor dysfunction typically predominates over sensory dysfunction and pain early in the disease process. Central nervous system (CNS) compression (Choice B), demyelination (Choice C), or ischemia (Choice D) typically affects major central nervous system tracts, leading to sensory, motor, and/or autonomic dysfunction contralateral to the lesion. This patient instead demonstrates deficits that are localized to a single spinal nerve root Exam Section : Item 14 of 50 Clinical Cervical nerve root compression explains this patient's symptoms of cervical radiculopathy.

This patient instead demonstrates deficits that are localized to a single spina l nerve root. Median nerve compression at the elbow (Choice F) typically causes anterior interosseous syndrome, a pure motor neuropathy leading to a decreased ability to pinch the first two digits and form a fist. Median nerve compression at the wrist (Choice G) initially leads to pain and paresthesias in the first three digits and may progress to hand weakness, known as carpal tunnel syndrome. Radial nerve compression at the elbow (Choice H) presents primarily with pain of the elbow and dorsal forearm that may radiate to the dorsum of the fingers. Motor and sensory symptoms are less prominent. Radial nerve compression at the spiral groove (Choice I) results in extensor muscle dysfunction of the elbow, wrist, and fingers. Numbness, pain, and/or paresthesias from the triceps to the fingers may occur. The triceps reflex, not the biceps reflex, would be affected. While ulnar nerve compression at the elbow (Choice J) typically results in numbness and paresthesias of the medial hand and wrist, ulnar nerve compression at the wrist (Choice K) typically leads to weakness of the intrinsic hand muscles and the consequent loss of hand dexterity. Patients may demonstrate a decreased ability to abduct and adduct the digits. Educationa l Objective: Radiculopathy refers to pathology affecting a specific spinal nerve root that leads to weakness, numbness, paresthesias, and pain in the dermatomal and myotomal distribution that correlates to the affected root. C6 radiculopathy will cause decreased sensation, pain, and/or paresthesia in the lateral forearm and the lateral two digits. Additionally, C6 radiculopathy causes motor dysfunction of elbow flexion and wrist extension, along with an absent biceps reflex Clinical \"t 15. A 67-year-old man with hypertension is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after a stroke. Examination shows Horner syndrome and paralysis of the palate on the right. Sensation is decreased to pain over the right side of the face and left side of the body, and sensation is absent to hot and cold over the right face and left side of the body. There is no paralysis of the extremities. Which of the following is the most likely site of infarction? A) Right brachium pontis B) Right lateral medulla C) Right midbrain D) Right temporal lobe E) Right thalamus Correct Answer: B. Lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome is caused by occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, leading to an ischemic stroke of the lateral medulla. Five main structures are affected, which include the nucleus ambiguus, vestibular nuclei, lateral spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, and inferior cerebellar peduncle. Loss of the nucleus ambiguus leads to dysphagia, a decreased gag reflex, and hoarseness. The vestibular nucleus loss causes vomiting, vertigo, and nystagmus. The contralateral body and ipsilateral face will develop decreased pain and temperature sensation from involvement of the lateral spinothalamic tract. Horner syndrome may result if the sympathetic fibers are damaged. Additiona lly, ataxia and dysmetria from the involvement of the cerebellar peduncles will also be present. However, a patient with lateral medullary syndrome may not necessarily demonstrate all of these findings in equal proportion, as in this case. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E. The brachium pontis (Choice A), or middle cerebellar peduncles projecting from the pons, may be affected by ischemic events involving the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Similar to lateral medullary syndrome, symptoms of an infarct involving the brachium pontis include ataxia and dysmetria, which are absent in this case. Infarction of the midbrain (Choice C) occurs when the basilar artery becomes occluded. This would impact the oculomotor and trochlear nerves. This patient does not demonstrate any eye movement impairment. Infarction of the right temporal lobe (Choice D), depending on the side of the patient's dominant hemisphere, may impact regions such as the Wernicke area of speech and Meyer loop of the visual pathway. As well, it may impact the primary auditory cortex, resulting in varying degrees of hearing impairment depending on the extent of infarction.

As well, it may impact the primary auditory cortex, resulting in varying degrees of hearing impairment depending on the extent of infarction. Infarction of the right thalamus (Choice E) may develop from occlusion of one of four different arteries, the tuberothalamic artery, paramedian artery, inferolateral artery, or posterior choroidal artery. Depending on the artery involved, symptoms may range from cognitive behavioral disturbances and memory deficits, to sensorimotor impairment and visual field defects. When the right thalamus is involved, hemineglect is typically also present. Educational Objective: Lateral medullary syndrome is caused by occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Symptoms include a combination of dysphagia, decreased gag reflex, hoarseness, vertigo, nystagmus, decreased pain and temperature sensation on the ipsilateral face and contralatera l body, Horner syndrome, ataxia, and dysmetria. ., Exam Section : Item 16 of 50 Clinical A 5-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents because of a 4-hour history of unsteady gait and two episodes of vomiting. Three weeks ago, she had an upper respiratory tract infection that did not require treatment. There is no history of trauma or evidence of toxic ingestion. She takes no medications. Her temperature is 36. 7°C (98°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg. Examination shows slight horizontal nystagmus. Funduscopic examination shows no abnorma lities. The patient is able to sit without support but is unable to walk without support. Deep tendon reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Re-examination in 24 hours B) Complete blood count C) CT scan of the head D) EEG E) Lumbar puncture Correct Answer: C. The patient is showing signs and symptoms concerning for cerebellar ataxia, including gait disturbance and nystagmus. Other associated findings may include dysarthria, speech abnormalities, impaired coordination, vomiting, and headache. Patients typically do not present with a fever, meningismus, or seizures. Acute cerebellar ataxia usually occurs following an acute febrile illness in children under 6 years of age. In the setting of an acute presentation with neurologic deficits, CT scan of the head is effective to evaluate for acute intracranial hemorrhage, tumor, or hydrocephalus that may require emergent management. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E. Re-examination in 24 hours (Choice A) would not be appropriate, as the patient is showing concerning neurologic findings that should be evaluated urgently. Complete blood count (Choice B) could be helpful in evaluating for infection or anemia, neither of which would be the likely cause of the patient's cerebellar neurologic symptoms. An EEG (Choice D) would be helpful in evaluating seizures, which are typically characterized by involuntary rhythmic movements, lapse of consciousness, a posticta l state, and may be accompanied by tongue biting and/or incontinence. This patient's symptoms are taking place while she is awake, alert, and following commands, making seizures unlikely. A lumbar puncture (Choice E) would be the test of choice to evaluate for meningitis. Meningitis is characterized by fever, neck rigidity, and headache. While meningitis can cause focal neurologic deficits, they are typically cranial nerve abnormalities. In addition, this patient is not showing associated signs of meningitis. r ~, - . r,",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cervical nerve root compression explains this patient's symptoms of cervical radiculopathy. Radiculopathy refers to pathology affecting a specific spinal nerve root that leads to weakness, numbness, paresthesias, and pain in the dermatomal and myotomal distribution that correlates to the affected root. C6 radiculopathy will result in pain that radiates from the neck into the arm along with decreased sensation, pain, and/or paresthesia in the lateral forearm and the lateral two digits. Additional ly, C6 radiculopathy causes motor dysfunction of elbow flexion and wrist extension, and a diminished or absent biceps reflex. Radiculopathy symptoms may worsen with activities that increase pressure such as coughing and sneezing. Radiculopathy may be caused by spondylosis (degenerative changes of the spine), disc herniation, infection, tumor, demyelination, or infarction. Dermatomes and myotomes are components of the embryonic somite, a paired segment of paraxial mesoderm. When fully developed, the dermatome is an area of skin whose afferent fibers travel within a single spinal nerve, and myotome is a group of muscles innervated by the efferent fibers from a single spinal nerve.",

Lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome is caused by occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, leading to an ischemic stroke of the lateral medulla. Five main structures are affected, which include the nucleus ambiguus, vestibular nuclei, lateral spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, and inferior cerebellar peduncle. Loss of the nucleus ambiguus leads to dysphagia, a decreased gag reflex, and hoarseness. The vestibular nucleus loss causes vomiting, vertigo, and nystagmus.

However, a patient with lateral medullary syndrome may not necessarily demonstrate all of these findings in equal proportion, as in this case. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E. The brachium pontis (Choice A), or middle cerebellar peduncles projecting from the pons, may be affected by ischemic events involving the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Similar to lateral medullary syndrome, symptoms of an infarct involving the brachium pontis include ataxia and dysmetria, which are absent in this case. Infarction of the midbrain (Choice C) occurs when the basilar artery becomes occluded. This would impact the oculomotor and trochlear nerves. This patient does not demonstrate any eye movement impairment. Infarction of the right temporal lobe (Choice D), depending on the side of the patient's dominant hemisphere, may impact regions such as the Wernicke area of speech and Meyer loop of the visual pathway. As well, it may impact the primary auditory cortex, resulting in varying degrees of hearing impairment depending on the extent of infarction. Infarction of the right thalamus (Choice E) may develop from occlusion of one of four different arteries, the tuberothalamic artery, paramedian artery, inferolateral artery, or posterior choroidal artery. Depending on the artery involved, symptoms may range from cognitive behavioral disturbances and memory deficits, to sensorimotor impairment and visual field defects. When the right thalamus is involved, hemineglect is typically also present."

Three weeks ago, she had an upper respiratory tract infection that did not require treatment. There is no history of trauma or evidence of toxic ingestion. She takes no medications. Her temperature is 36. 7°C (98°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg. Examination shows slight horizontal nystagmus. Funduscopic examination shows no abnorma lities. The patient is able to sit without support but is unable to walk without support. Deep tendon reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Re-examination in 24 hours B) Complete blood count C) CT scan of the head D) EEG E) Lumbar puncture Correct Answer: C. The patient is showing signs and symptoms concerning for cerebellar ataxia, including gait disturbance and nystagmus. Other associated findings may include dysarthria, speech abnormalities, impaired coordination, vomiting, and headache. Patients typically do not present with a fever, meningismus, or seizures. Acute cerebellar ataxia usually occurs following an acute febrile illness in children under 6 years of age. In the setting of an acute presentation with neurologic deficits, CT scan of the head is effective to evaluate for acute intracranial hemorrhage, tumor, or hydrocephalus that may require emergent management. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E. Re-examination in 24 hours (Choice A) would not be appropriate, as the patient is showing concerning neurologic findings that should be evaluated urgently. Complete blood count (Choice B) could be helpful in evaluating for infection or anemia, neither of which would be the likely cause of the patient's cerebellar neurologic symptoms. An EEG (Choice D) would be helpful in evaluating seizures, which are typically characterized by involuntary rhythmic movements, lapse of consciousness, a posticta l state, and may be accompanied by tongue biting and/or incontinence. This patient's symptoms are taking place while she is awake, alert, and following commands, making seizures unlikely. A lumbar puncture (Choice E) would be the test of choice to evaluate for meningitis. Meningitis is characterized by fever, neck rigidity, and headache. While meningitis can cause focal neurologic deficits, they are typically cranial nerve abnormalities. In addition, this patient is not showing associated signs of meningitis. r ~, - . r,",

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Craniopharyngioma B) Hypertensive encephalopathy C) Major depressive disorder D) Migraine E) Subdural hematoma F) Temporal arteritis Correct Answer: E. Head trauma, the use of anticoagulants, physical abuse, alcohol use disorder, cerebral atrophy, and malignancy are associated with an increased risk for developing a subdural hematoma (SDH). Elderly patients are at risk for cerebral atrophy, which places traction on dural bridging cortical veins. In this setting, minor trauma such as falls can result in shearing of the veins leading to hemorrhage. In some cases, patients may not report a history of trauma. Patients may present with headaches, vomiting, meningismus, or hemiparesis, or they may manifest upper motoneuron examination findings such as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar reflex (Babinski sign). In some cases, the SDH may be large enough to compress adjacent brain parenchyma; the displacement of the cerebral hemisphere can result in neurologic deficits, altered mental status, seizures, herniation syndromes, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. On imaging, SDH appears as a crescent-shaped fluid collection abutting the internal surface of the skull, not bound by suture lines. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, and F.

A 67-year-o ld woman is brought to the physician because of progressive imbalance and memory difficulties over the past year. Two years ago, she began to have episodes of sudden imbalance with a tendency to fall backwards. She has developed progressive slowness of thought and movement and has had brief episodes of double vision. Examination shows mildly decreased short-term memory and slowness of verbal responses. Downward gaze and upward gaze are markedly impaired. There is marked rigidity of the neck and mild rigidity of the limbs. The gait is broad based with short shuffling steps, and she easily loses her balance, falling backwards. All movements are performed slowly. A CT scan of the head without contrast shows moderate, diffuse atrophy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Creutzfe ldt-Jakob disease B) Dementia, Alzheimer type C) Hydrocep halus D) Hypothyroidism E) Multi-infarct (vascular) dementia F) Parkinson disease with dementia G) Progressive supranuclear palsy; H) Syphilis I) Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome Correct Answer: G. Progressive supranuclear palsy, an atypical parkinsonian disorder, is a neurodegenerative disease associated with tau-positive neurofibri llary tangles in the basal ganglia, cortex, and brainstem. Patients typically present at an average age of 65 years with gait instability, oculomotor deficits (classically vertical gaze palsy), frontal lobe deficits, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity. The gait pattern varies in step length and base width, though patients typically walk and pivot too quickly (as a result of impulsivity from frontal lobe damage), leading to backward falls. Definitive diagnosis occurs by neuropathologic examination illustrating a pattern of neurofibrillary tangles in the characteristic distribution. Neuroimaging illustrating midbrain and/or cerebral cortex atrophy supports the diagnosis. Death typically occurs 6 to 9 years after disease onset. Management is supportive and includes physical and occupational therapy along with advanced care planning. Incorrect Answer: A, B, C, D, E, F, H, and I. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (Choice A) is a human prion disease that presents with rapidly progressing dementia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, cerebellar dysfunction, corticospinal tract dysfunction, basal ganglia dysfunction, and stimulus-induced myoclonus.

Patients may present with headaches, vomiting, meningismus, or hemiparesis, or they may manifest upper motoneuron examination findings such as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar reflex (Babinski sign). In some cases, the SDH may be large enough to compress adjacent brain parenchyma; the displacement of the cerebral hemisphere can result in neurologic deficits, altered mental status, seizures, herniation syndromes, and signs of increased intracranial pressure.

Complex partial seizure disorder (Choice B), also called focal onset impaired awareness seizures, is characterized by localized motor or sensory symptoms associated with loss of awareness during episodes. Generalized loss of motor tone and bradycardia are more suggestive of carotid sinus hypersensitivity. Idiopathic orthostatic hypotension (Choice C) is unlikely to explain this patient's symptoms given normal orthostatic vital signs on examination. Orthostatic hypotension is characterized by tachycardia in response to the decreased preload, rather than bradycardia as observed in this patient.

Wernicke encephalopathy develops in patients with extreme malnourishment and/or alcohol use disorder. While a serum thiamine concentration may be decreased, this is not useful in managing patients as it cannot be checked quickly. Thus, diagnosis is clinical and should be rapidly treated with intravenous thiamine administration. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E. Intensive physical therapy (Choice A) would not address the underlying diagnosis of Wernicke encephalopathy. Delayed diagnosis of this condition potentially leads to coma and death. Intravenous glucose therapy (Choice B) should not be administered until after thiamine has been given in the setting of Wernicke encephalopathy, since glucose alone can theoretical ly worsen symptoms. Once thiamine has been replenished, then intravenous glucose may be given. Intravenous vitamin B (cyanocoba lamin) therapy (Choice D) may be utilized in the treatment of megaloblastic anemia resulting from 12 vitamin B (cobalamin) deficiency. This most commonly occurs in the context of vegan ism, pernicious anemia, and Crohn disease. It is 12 not necessary to supplement in the case of Wernicke encephalopathy. Oral lactulose therapy (Choice E) is the treatment of choice for hepatic encephalopathy. This is most commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis whose ability to process ammonia from the gastrointestina l tract is impaired. This patient's liver is enlarged, not cirrhotic on physical examination. As well, disconjugate gaze would be absent in hepatic encephalopathy."

ACh acts on both nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors. Nicotinic ACh receptors are found in autonomic ganglia, adrenal medulla, and skeletal muscle, whereas muscarinic ACh receptors are found in heart, brain, smooth muscle, exocrine glands, and sweat glands. Resultant cholinergic excess leads to bronchospasm, bronchorrhea, bradycardia, diarrhea, lacrimation, and salivation. Because of the potential for organophosphate toxicity via transcutaneous exposure, medical professionals should always wear rubber gloves when treating the patient.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder arising in midlife that affects both lower motoneurons arising from the anterior horn and upper motoneurons of the lateral corticospina l tract within the brain and spinal cord. Neurons degenerate as the result of an unknown cause that may involve RNA processing and/or excitotoxicity. Patient presentations are variable, though typically feature a combination of upper motoneuron (eg, increased muscle tone, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign) and lower motoneuron findings (eg, decreased muscle tone, hyporeflexia, early muscle atrophy) in an asymmetric distribution that may include the bulbar muscles. Some patients may experience cognitive or behavioral changes, though other patients are cognitively normal. The diagnosis is primarily clinical but may be supported by electromyographic findings of acute and chronic denervation. ALS is a progressive disease with death usually occurring within 3 to 5 years of diagnosis, most commonly secondary to neuromuscular respiratory failure. This patient's dyspnea with lying supine is most likely secondary to diaphragmatic paralysis caused by his ALS. Symptoms of diaphragmatic paralysis worsen in the supine position, as gravity no longer assists in contracting and moving the diaphragm downward.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Bronchospasm occurs most commonly in the setting of reactive airway disease, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It typically presents with shortness of breath and wheezing on auscultation that is not position-dependent. While this patient may have some degree of reactive airway disease secondary to his significant smoking history, his symptoms are more consistent with diaphragmatic paralysis. Failure of the intercostal muscles (Choice C) may also occur in the late stages of ALS or in other neuromuscular diseases. lntercostal muscle weakness can lead to dyspnea, given their role in chest expansion, but this shortness of breath would not be dependent on positioning. Left ventricular failure (Choice D) can cause shortness of breath secondary to pulmonary edema and is commonly associated with lower extremity edema, weight gain, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, rales on lung auscultation, and increased jugular venous pressure. This patient has no signs of heart failure, and his shortness of breath with lying supine is more consistent with diaphragmatic paralysis. Panacinar emphysema (Choice E) more commonly presents with exertional dyspnea, chronic cough, and sputum production. Dyspnea is not typically exacerbated in the supine position. Pleural effusions (Choice F) can potentially cause dyspnea with supine positioning and are common in congestive heart failure. However, they would be associated with diminished breath sounds on auscultation, not rhonchi as in this patient."

The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial demonstrated that a short course of treatment with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone speeds the rate of visual recovery and delays the onset of MS, although it does not impact final visual acuity, and demonstrated that the presence and quantity of periventricular white matter lesions on MRI imaging is the most important prognostic risk factor for the subsequent development of MS. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I. The cerebellum (Choice A) coordinates ocular saccades, pursuit movements, and gaze holding. Cerebellar lesions do not cause an rAPD. Cranial nerve Ill (Choice C), the oculomotor nerve, is responsible for motor innervation of the levator palpebrae superioris; the superior, medial, and inferior rectus muscles; and the inferior oblique muscle. Deficits of the oculomotor nerve present with ptosis, exotropia, and hypotropia. Cranial nerve IV (Choice D), the trochlear nerve, is responsible for motor innervation of the superior oblique muscle. Deficits of the trochlear nerve present with diplopia, hypertropia, and compensatory head tilt. Cranial nerve VI (Choice E), the abducens nerve, is responsible for motor innervation of the lateral rectus muscle. Deficits of the abducens nerve present with esotropia and diplopia worst during horizontal gaze. Extraocular muscles (Choice F) may cause diplopia in the setting of thyroid ophthalmopathy, orbital mass lesions, or entrapment within a fractured orbital bone. Dysfunction of the extraocular muscles does not produce a rAPD. Lesions of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) (Choice G) cause internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), which presents with an ipsilateral adduction deficit, characterized by an inability of the affected eye to cross midline, and an associated contralateral abduction saccade.

In the former, the lateral corticospinal tract, medial lemniscus, and hypoglossal nerve are affected, leading to contralateral muscle weakness, contralateral impaired proprioception, and ipsilateral tongue deviation, respectively. In lateral medullary syndrome, dysphagia, hoarseness, and decreased gag reflex occur because of involvement of the nucleus ambiguus. The vestibular nucleus and lateral spinothalamic tract are also impaired. These findings are not seen in this patient. Infarction of the midbrain (Choice C) would impact the function of the oculomotor and trochlear nerves. This patient does not demonstrate any eye movement deficits. Infarction of the temporal lobe (Choice E) may impact regions such as the Wernicke area of speech and Meyer loop of the visual pathway. As well, it may impact the primary auditory cortex, resulting in varying degrees of hearing impairment depending on the extent of infarction."

Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused by reactivation of a latent infection with herpes zoster virus within the geniculate ganglion. Viral reactivation within the geniculate ganglion leads to facial nerve palsy, which causes paralysis of the muscles of facial expression (including the forehead) and may cause lagophthalmos and corneal dryness. In addition, the proximity of the vestibulocochlear nerve to the geniculate ganglion increases the risk for its involvement, which causes a characteristic presentation of ear pain and vesicular rash of the external ear canal or auricle, and may also cause hearing loss, vertigo, and nystagmus. The diagnosis is clinical but may be confirmed with PCR amplification testing. Treatment includes oral prednisone and acyclovir.",

By decreasing mesolimbic 2 dopamine signaling, fluphenazine treats the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia.

The chronic use of antidopaminergic agents may also upregulate D receptors in the basal ganglia, leading to tardive dyskinesia. Management of 2 medication-induced parkinsonism typically involves adding an anticholinergic medication such as benztropine, which counteracts antidopaminergic activity and addresses parkinsonism. In this patient with schizophrenia already on an anticholinergic medication (benztropine ), the next step is decreasing or discontinuing the dose of the offending medication and switching to an antipsychotic medication that causes less potent D antagonism. 2",

Patients may be asymptomatic, or they may experience seizures or focal neurologic deficits related to the tumor location. Meningiomas are typically benign but can be malignant. Malignant meningiomas may grow rapidly, leading to symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (postural headache, nausea, papilledema). Meningiomas appear as well-circumscribed, extra-axia l (outside of the brain parenchyma) masses that compress the underlying parenchyma. They demonstrate uniform enhancement on CT imaging. Definitive diagnosis requires histologic examination of the tissue, which will demonstrate spindle cells arranged in a whorled pattern with psammoma bodies.

Approximately 80% to 85% of strokes are ischemic, common ly arising from thromboembo lic disease, whereas 15% to 20% of strokes are hemorrhagic because of blood vessel rupture. Risk factors for stroke include smoking, hypertension, diabetes, carotid or intracranial atherosclerotic disease, history of hypercoagulability, atrial fibrillation, and advanced age. Classically, strokes manifest as a neurologic deficit related to the affected part of the brain. Occlusion of the left posterior cerebra l artery (PCA) explains this patient's deficits. The PCA supplies much of the occipita l lobes as well as the inferomedia l temporal lobe, posteromedia l parietal lobe, thalamus, and parts of the brainstem. Occlusion of the left PCA typically leads to right homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing (as a result of damage of the left primary visual cortex). Right homonymous hemianopia likely explains this patient's car accident. Occlusion of the left PCA may also result in right hemisensory deficit (caused by thalamus damage) and right hemiparesis (caused by damage to the cerebral peduncles in the midbrain). As well, damage to the left parietal cortex may occur and lead to agraphia, acalculia, finger agnosia, and left-right disorientation (Gerstmann syndrome).",

Patients may also require intubation and mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, cardiac pacing, and/or surgical spine stabilization. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, E, and F. Intravenous ceftriaxone therapy (Choice A) is used in the treatment of bacterial meningitis, along with vancomycin and, depending on patient age, ampicillin. Bacterial meningitis presents acutely with fever, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status in a toxic-appearing patient, although it can also cause focal neurologic deficits. Intravenous labetalol therapy (Choice B) is used in hypertensive urgency and emergency, which present with increased blood pressures, typically with the systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mm Hg. End-organ damage is characteristic of hypertensive emergency. This patient's blood pressure is near normal and does not require correction with intravenous medication. Intravenous mannitol therapy (Choice C) can be used to decrease cerebral edema in the setting of traumatic brain injury, since it is an osmotic diuretic that draws excess fluid out from tissues and excretes it from the body. It plays less of a role in controlling edema of the spinal cord, and its onset of action is longer than that of methylprednisolone. Oral prednisone therapy (Choice E) is used in rheumatic diseases, allergic reactions, and inflammatory or immune reactions. While it could decrease the spinal cord edema seen in this patient because of its anti-inflammatory properties, its onset of action is longer than methylprednisolone. Surgical exploration of the cervical spine (Choice F) is typically performed in the setting of an unstable vertebral fracture or dislocation. It may be necessary in this case; however, glucocorticoids can be administered immediately to begin temporizing the effect of the lesion."

Delirium tremens, the most concerning and life-threatening complication of alcohol withdrawal, involves severe confusion and disorientation, fluctuations in consciousness, agitation, visual hallucinations, and autonomic instability (variable heart rate and blood pressure with hyperthermia). Delirium tremens typically begins 2 to 5 days after the patient's last alcoholic drink.

Acute subdural hematoma (Choice A) refers to bleeding between the dura and arachnoid membranes, most commonly caused by head trauma in elderly patients and persons with alcohol use disorder. Patients typically present with a declining neurologic status or coma. This patient does not demonstrate signs of head trauma on physical examination, and sympathetic overdrive is more consistent with alcohol withdrawal. Alcohol intoxication (Choice B) can cause slurred speech, ataxia, emotional !ability, and memory lapses. Sympathetic overdrive is more consistent with alcohol withdrawal. Brief psychotic disorder (Choice C) is characterized by at least one acute psychotic symptom (eg, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior) lasting less than 1 month. Sympathetic overdrive and disorientation are more consistent with delirium tremens.

Hamartomas can form in the soft tissue (leading to Shagreen patches, or subcutaneous oval nodules) or brain (leading to epilepsy and intellectua l disability). Cardiac rhabdomyomas (leading to mitral regurgitation) and renal angiomyolipomas are also common. Other typical dermatologic findings include ash leaf spots (hypomelanotic macules) and angiofibromas, which are acneiform lesions without comedones (clogged hair follicles). Subependymal giant cell tumors are common, which typically demonstrate calcification and may increase the likelihood of developing seizures. Though these tumors are benign, patients are at risk for developing malignancies in the soft tissues, brain, or kidney. Diagnosis is typically clinical but may be confirmed by genetic testing indicating a mutated TSC gene.

Type 1 presents with cutaneous neurofibromas (benign neoplasms derived from neural crest cells), cafe au lait spots, pigmented iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules), optic gliomas, and pheochromocytomas. Type 2 presents with cutaneous neurofibromas, bilateral vestibular schwannomas, additional schwannomas of the cranial nerves or in the spinal cord, intracranial meningiomas, and neuropathy. Subependymal brain lesions are atypical, and the dermatologic findings differ between tuberous sclerosis and neurofibromatosis. Sturge-Weber syndrome (Choice C) is a neurocutaneous disorder that presents with the proliferation of capillary-size blood vessels, seen on examination as nevus flammeus (a benign birthmark also known as a port-wine stain), angiomatosis of the leptomeninges (leading to seizures, intellectual disability, focal neurologic deficits), and episcleral hemangioma. The causative activating mutation of the GNAQ gene is typically sporadic rather than inherited. TORCH syndrome (Choice D) refers to fetal infection by any of a group of organisms: Toxop/asma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, or Herpes simplex virus, and others. Newborns may demonstrate a variety of consequent symptoms, which often include fever, feeding difficulties, petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, deafness, and/or vision abnormalities.

While, depending on the location, this could cause lower extremity weakness, it would cause hyperreflexia rather than hyporeflexia because of the involvement of the upper motoneuron. This patient's lower extremity hyporeflexia indicates a peripheral cause affecting the lower motoneuron. Metastatic spread of the cancer hematogenously (Choice B) would be more likely to cause foci of malignancy to develop in other organs including the bones, liver, or lungs. This is an uncommon complication of medulloblastoma since extraneural metastases are rare with this particular tumor. Radiation necrosis of the brain stem (Choice D) would cause symptoms of midbrain, pons, and medulla infarcts. The cranial nerve nuclei along with ascending and descending spinal tracts would be affected. Symptoms would include impaired cranial nerve function and decreased sensorimotor function of the ipsilateral face and contralateral body. Lower extremity weakness would be accompanied by hyperreflexia, not hyporeflexia, because of the involvement of the upper motoneurons. Thrombosis of the anterior spinal artery (Choice E) causes dysfunction of the anterior tracts within the spinal cord including the corticospinal tract (loss of motor function), spinothalamic tract (loss of pain and temperature sensation), and anterior horns. Thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus (Choice F) is rare because of the large size of this sinus. However, when it does occur, thrombosis in this area results in severe headaches followed by the potential for altered mental status, bilateral neurologic deficits, and seizures. This patient's findings are more consistent with cauda equina syndrome secondary to metastatic spread of cancer."

Aquaporin-4 autoantibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are diagnostic of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), a disease characterized by intense inflammation and demyelination of both the optic nerves and various spinal cord segments, with involvement of both grey and white matter. Common manifestations include episodes of optic neuritis, which manifests as vision loss and pain, and transverse myelitis, which can affect any level of the spinal cord. Other unique findings include episodes of hiccups with associated nausea and vomiting. The disease course is often described as relapsing and remitting, with some patients experiencing few symptoms between episodes. Treatment is with high-dose intravenous steroids and, occasionally, plasma exchange for acute attacks. Prophylaxis with eculizumab or other biologic agents is warranted at the time of diagnosis. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E. Abnormal echocardiography (Choice A) is seen in patients with strokes secondary to septic emboli from endocarditis, but this patient does not have any evidence of endocarditis, and strokes typically present with unilateral symptoms as opposed to bilateral symptoms, which is more consistent with a spinal cord syndrome. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in the serum (Choice B) are a feature of many rheumatologic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus. There is also a portion of the population that has positive ANA titers and no identifiable disease; thus, this is a nonspecific finding. Decreased peripheral nerve conduction velocities (Choice D) are characteristic of peripheral neuropathy, which usually manifests with sensory changes or weakness of the extremities in a stocking-g love distribution. NMO is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS), and this patient's findings of positive Babinski tests and hyperreflexia are consistent with a central pathology. Decreased serum copper concentration (Choice E) is not a feature of NMO. Increased copper concentration is seen in Wilson disease, which can present with psychosis, Kayser-Fleischer rings, and cirrhosis."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Puberty in boys typically follows a predictable course of gonadarche (enlargement of the testes), followed by pubarche (pubic hair), followed by adrenarche (axillary hair, facial hair, voice changes), followed by a growth spurt. This differs from the process in girls, which proceeds from thelarche (breast buds) to pubarche to growth spurt and finally menarche. In boys, delayed puberty is defined as the absence of testicular enlargement or secondary sexual characteristics at the age of 14 years. The most common cause of delayed puberty is constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), accounting for approximately 50% of cases, a normal variant. In CDGP, there is a transient defect in the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone with resultant delay in the stimulation of pituitary production of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. CDGP tends to be familial with many members of the same family undergoing late puberty compared with peers. In this case, the patient has undergone gonadarche (indicated by his Tanner stage 2 genital development) and pubarche but has not yet undergone adrenarche. Thus, while delayed, the sequence of his procession through the steps of puberty is appropriate and he can be reassured that his development will continue to progress.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Measurement of serum testosterone concentration is unnecessary in this case because the patient is progressing through the stages of puberty as expected. If his puberty did not continue to progress, testosterone measurement could be used to differentiate CDGP from another pathology. Mild bilateral gynecomastia can be normal in early puberty as a result of the small increase in extragonadal production of estrogen relative to the amount of testosterone being produced. Urine toxicology screening (Choice C) would be appropriate if there was a suspicion for drug use inducing gynecomastia, of which marijuana is the most common recreational drug. Breast biopsy (Choice E) would be indicated if the breast enlargement was caused by a nodule or mass rather than true gynecomastia. If delayed puberty were accompanied by neurologic findings or suspected to be caused by a process involving the brain such as a pituitary adenoma, MRI of the brain, not CT scan of the head (Choice D), would be indicated. Neither imaging modality is necessary in this case."

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening all sexually active adolescent women under the age of 25 years for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. Chlamydia trachomatis is a common sexually transmitted disease that can cause various infections including cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, epididymitis, and urethritis. However, in most cases it is asymptomatic and thus screening asymptomatic individuals is important for disclosing and treating active infections before long-term sequelae develop. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae also commonly co-infect the same individual. This patient's examination demonstrates cervical ectropion, which develops when there is slight eversion of the cervix to expose a portion of the endocervix and its columnar mucosa to the vaginal canal. In young women, it is a normal variant and does not warrant treatment, although it does increase the risk for acquiring sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and HIV.",

Prior to that time, cytologic study of cells collected from the cervix alone is adequate for the screening of cervical cancer. After the age of 30, cervical cancer screening may be performed by cytologic study every 3 years or by cytologic study combined with HPV testing every 5 years. Measurement of serum follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormone concentrations (Choice C) is unnecessary since this patient does not demonstrate signs of delayed puberty. There are no indications to suggest an abnormality in this patient's hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine concentrations (Choice D) is unnecessary and not indicated for screening in an asymptomatic individual. Measurement of these laboratory values would be indicated if the patient were showing signs or symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.",
        "E": "Colposcopy is a procedure in which the cervix is visualized under magnification for the purpose of identifying cancerous or precancerous areas to obtain diagnostic samples. Colposcopy is indicated as a follow-up to an abnormal cervical cancer screening test or to further evaluate abnormal findings on initial cervical examination.

In this patient, her symptoms of tiredness, progressively heavier and irregular periods (menometrorrhagia), and bradycardia, in the setting of a preexisting autoimmune disease (type 1 diabetes mellitus) suggests the presence of a second autoimmune condition, likely acquired hypothyroidism secondary to Hashimoto thyroiditis. While many causes of hypothyroidism exist, Hashimoto disease is a common cause of painless thyroiditis, which may present with a palpable, enlarged thyroid gland, as in this patient. With progressive inflammation and destruction of the thyroid parenchyma, circulating concentrations of thyroxine and triiodothyronine decrease, with resulting feedback on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary leading to increased concentrations of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and prolactin. The increased TSH concentration is measurable in serum and provides ongoing trophic stimulation to the thyroid gland. Increased prolactin may cause breast development, galactorrhea, and may promote irregular anovulatory cycles or amenorrhea through feedback on gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Treatment includes supplementation with levothyroxine and frequent follow-up visits to evaluate for therapeutic effectiveness, including monitoring of serum TSH concentration.",

Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (Choice B) is an androgen produced by the adrenal zona reticularis. It may be increased in cases of polycystic ovarian syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and Cushing disease, though is more often used to identify a source of hyperandrogenism in patients with virilization, precocious puberty, or infertility. When increased, the adrenal gland is likely the source of the endogenous increase in steroid synthesis, and when normal, the source is often a functional ovarian or testicular tumor.",

Physical examination may show bradycardia, dry, edematous skin, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. In this patient, her symptoms of tiredness, progressively heavier and irregular periods (menometrorrhagia), and bradycardia, in the setting of a preexisting autoimmune disease (type 1 diabetes mellitus) suggests the presence of a second autoimmune condition, likely acquired hypothyroidism secondary to Hashimoto thyroiditis. While many causes of hypothyroidism exist, Hashimoto disease is a common cause of painless thyroiditis, which may present with a palpable, enlarged thyroid gland, as in this patient. With progressive inflammation and destruction of the thyroid parenchyma, circulating concentrations of thyroxine and triiodothyronine decrease, with resulting feedback on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary leading to increased concentrations of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and prolactin. The increased TSH concentration is measurable in serum and provides ongoing trophic stimulation to the thyroid gland. Increased prolactin may cause breast development, galactorrhea, and may promote irregular anovulatory cycles or amenorrhea through feedback on gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Treatment includes supplementation with levothyroxine and frequent follow-up visits to evaluate for therapeutic effectiveness, including monitoring of serum TSH concentration.",

Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (Choice B) is an androgen produced by the adrenal zona reticularis. It may be increased in cases of polycystic ovarian syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and Cushing disease, though is more often used to identify a source of hyperandrogenism in patients with virilization, precocious puberty, or infertility. When increased, the adrenal gland is likely the source of the endogenous increase in steroid synthesis, and when normal, the source is often a functional ovarian or testicular tumor.",

Since blood flow through the PDA occurs in both systole and diastole, the sound will be present throughout the cardiac cycle. The ductus arteriosus is one of several physiologic shunts existing during the prenatal period. In utero, oxygenated blood is obtained from the placenta, not from the lungs, and the ductus arteriosus (DA) allows the shunting of oxygenated blood from the pulmonary artery directly to the aorta while bypassing the fetal lungs, which are filled with amniotic fluid. At birth, closure of the DA occurs by the release of prostaglandins and increased arterial oxygen tension. With increased blood oxygenation and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance following birth or with indomethacin use, prostaglandin production falls and the ductus closes. Certain congenital heart diseases require the presence of a shunt to allow arteriovenous admixture of oxygenated blood, for example, transposition of the great vessels. In the absence of such a requirement for shunting, a PDA results in a chronic extracardiac left-to-right shunt that may result in pulmonary hypertension or right-sided heart failure, with the risk for Eisenmenger syndrome if uncorrected. PDAs that are small often go undetected until adulthood because the left-to-right shunt is not significant enough to cause symptoms.",

IDA is extremely prevalent worldwide, especially in developing countries, in pregnant women, and in children. Infants and children are particularly vulnerable to IDA as a result of rapid growth and dietary deficiencies. The patient has been fed primarily cow's milk for the past 6 months, along with table food, while formula was stopped at 6 months of age. This places the infant at risk for iron deficiency given the insufficient amount of iron in cow's milk. Many types of formulas and foods are fortified with iron to ensure appropriate supplementation. Iron is required for the synthesis of heme, which is a necessary component of the hemoglobin molecule, and thus, of erythrocytes. It functions to shuttle oxygen to and from peripheral tissues. Erythrocytes on the peripheral blood smear are hypochromic as a result of deficient hemoglobin concentration. It is hypothesized that erythrocytes are microcytic as a result of continuing erythrocyte division in order to reach an adequate hemoglobin concentration. Because hemoglobin stores are inadequate, cell division continues beyond what would normally occur and causes the cells to be smaller than normal. Treatment in the case of poor dietary intake is with oral iron supplementation. If severe, parenteral iron can be administered.",

He was born at 39 weeks' gestation following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. He is alert and mildly irritable but easily consoled by his mother. His rectal temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 160/min, and respirations are 38/min . Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities . The tympanic membranes are mildly erythematous with normal landmarks and motility. The lungs are clear to auscultation . The abdomen is soft with no palpable masses . The patient is uncircumcised .

Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? A) Cefazolin B) Cefotaxime C) Nafcillin D) Penicillin E) Vancomycin Correct Answer: B. Urinary tract infections are characterized by dysuria, urinary urgency, frequency, or incontinence. In infants, urinary tract infections may present solely with fever, irritability, or fussiness. Urinalysis often shows leukocytes, bacteria, and the presence of nitrites and leukocyte esterase. Risk factors for urinary tract infections include being less than 1 year of age, female, or an uncircumcised male. It should also be suspected especially when there is no other source of infection identified, such as otitis media or upper respiratory tract infection. Urinary tract infections should be treated with antibiotics with sufficient coverage of gram negative rods. Cefotaxime is a third-generation cephalosporin that would be sufficient to treat this patient's urinary tract infection. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E. Cefazolin (Choice A) is a first-generation cephalosporin. It does have some activity against E. coli but lacks activity against many gram-negative rods. First-generation cephalosporins may be appropriate for a urinary tract infection if culture and sensitivity data support a susceptible organism. A third-generation cephalosporin is a broader choice. Nafcillin (Choice C) is used to treat gram-positive organisms, especially methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. It would not be the antibiotic of choice in a urinary tract infection, which is typically caused by gram negative rods. Similarly, penicillin (Choice D) may be inadequate to treat this urinary tract infection as it has limited coverage of gram-negative bacteria. Vancomycin (Choice E) inhibits bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan formation in gram-positive bacteria by binding to D-Ala-D-Ala. It is effective in the treatment of resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus species. It does not have significant activity against gram-negative pathogens. Educational Objective: In infants, urinary tract infections may present solely with fever, irritability, or fussiness. Urinalysis often shows leukocytes, bacteria, and the presence of nitrites and leukocyte esterase. Urinary tract infections should be treated with antibiotics with sufficient coverage of gram-negative rods. r \" , r-- r ,",

Tufted hemangiomas present as firm, red lesions with ill-defined borders on the arms, legs, and trunk, often sparing the head and face. They become larger, darker, and indurated with age, although most stabilize in childhood. Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma is a subcutaneous vascular mass that appears as a purpuric raised lesion, most commonly on the extremities. It also tends to become darker and indurated with time. Both of these vascular tumors are associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, which presents with bleeding, ecchymoses, and petechiae as a result of platelet sequestration by the tumor and an associated coagulopathy. Development of this syndrome typically presents with a rapid enlargement of the tumor, thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and increased concentration. Treatment options include steroids, chemotherapy (eg, vincristine), and immunomodulators (eg, sirolimus).",

High-output congestive heart failure (Choice B) presents with shortness of breath, weight gain, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and peripheral edema, often in the setting of an arteriovenous fistula, cirrhosis, sepsis, or severe anemia. It does not present with bruising and petechiae. Impaired tissue growth due to altered vascular supply (Choice C) and increased tissue growth due to increased vascular supply (Choice D) are incorrect, as the altered vascular supply to the vascular tumor does not affect tissue growth.

Initial evaluation requires an attempt at insertion of a nasogastric tube and evaluation of its position with a chest x-ray. If the nasogastric tube remains coiled within the esophagus, this suggests the presence of esophageal atresia. Air within the gastrointestinal tract immediately after birth and prior to feeding suggests the existence of a TEF distal to the esophageal atresia. Definitive management requires surgical repair. Additional screening for associated congenital malformations should occur.",

While esophageal atresia is associated with malformation syndromes, it is not commonly correlated with a specific genetic abnormality. Ultrasonography of the abdomen (Choice B) can be used to evaluate for pyloric stenosis and intussusception, among other disorders. As the esophagus typically terminates in the thorax in the setting of esophageal atresia, ultrasonography of the abdomen does not play a role in its diagnosis. CT scan of the chest (Choice C) could potentially outline the patient's anatomy and characterize the esophageal atresia; however, placement of a nasogastric tube and chest x-ray would effectively provide the diagnosis while exposing the patient to less radiation.",

Initial evaluation commonly includes a chest x-ray or CT scan, which will potentially outline the extent of the patient's mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Definitive diagnosis requires excisional lymph node biopsy, which will disclose Reed-Sternberg cells (atypical cells with bilobed nuclei), a large inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophilic predominance, and fibrosis. Hodgkin cells are typically CD15- and CD30-positive. The most common subtype is nodular sclerosing, whereas the worst prognosis occurs in the setting of the lymphocyte-depleted subtype.

The aspiration of acidic stomach contents may cause aspiration pneumonitis, whereas the aspiration of gastrointestinal flora and bacteria can cause aspiration pneumonia. The volume of aspirate is a strong predictor of complications from aspiration, especially in the case of pneumonia, as the bacterial inoculum may overwhelm the native ability of pulmonary alveolar defense (macrophages, cilia, mucus) to prevent colonization, replication, and infection. Aspiration pneumonia classically presents with a cough productive of foul-smelling sputum, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, and rhonchi on physical examination. Imaging classically shows an infiltrate in the most dependent lung segments at the time of aspiration (eg, in the superior segment of the inferior lobe when supine or lower lobes when erect). Patients at a higher risk for aspiration include those with impaired airway-protective reflexes (eg, neurological injury, myasthenia gravis, altered mental status), frequent or forceful emesis, abnormal pharyngeal or airway anatomy or function (eg, malignancy, tracheoesophageal fistula), or severe gastroesophageal reflux. Options for the management of severe gastroesophageal reflux in children include dietary changes and proton pump inhibitors or histamine- 2 receptor antagonists, although these would not assist in decreasing the risk for aspiration pneumonia. Fundoplication is a surgical procedure that improves the gastroesophageal sphincter tone by wrapping the fundus around the distal esophagus, which decreases the frequency and severity of reflux.",

Fundoplication is a more reasonable option.",

Adrenal involvement classically presents with abdominal pain and distention, weight loss, and failure to thrive. Patients may also present with an associated paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome. Physical examination may show a firm, nodular mass that crosses the midline and diastolic hypertension. Diagnosis is suggested by the presence of increased catecholamine metabolites in the serum and urine. Neuroblastoma is associated with overamplification of the MYCN oncogene. Histologic characteristics include small round blue cells that may form rosette patterns clustered around a central lumen, with positive stains for bombesin and neuron-specific enolase markers. Neuroblastoma commonly metastasizes to bone and skin. Treatment and prognosis are dependent on the stage of the tumor at diagnosis and the presence or absence of MYCN amplification.",

Multicystic dysplastic kidney (Choice B) is a nonhereditary pediatric cystic renal disease that results from the formation of multiple renal cysts in utero. It is typically sporadic. It can affect one or both kidneys, with a higher incidence of bilateral involvement in females. The affected kidney is replaced by numerous cysts and retains no functioning renal tissue. Nephroblastoma (Wilms tumor) (Choice D) is the most common renal malignancy in childhood. It occurs secondary to mutations in tumor suppressor genes WT1 or WT2. It is characterized by a large, often palpable, unilateral flank mass and hematuria. It does not typically cross midline and is often smooth to palpation rather than nodular. Polycystic kidney disease (Choice E) refers to either autosomal recessive or dominant polycystic kidney disease. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is a form of infantile cystic renal disease that manifests with the development of numerous small renal cysts that replace the normal renal parenchyma, resulting in end-stage kidney disease.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The patient is most likely presenting with a malignant pleural effusion. His physical examination findings of jugular venous distention and edema of the face and upper extremities are suggestive of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, which is caused by obstruction of the SVC and venous congestion of the upper body and face. Obstruction of the SVC is often caused by extrinsic compression by a malignant mediastinal or pulmonary mass, which may be secondary to lung cancer, lymphoma, or metastatic disease from another primary source. Pleural effusions are clinically suspected on examination in the setting of dullness to percussion and diminished breath sounds, and can be visualized on imaging including chest x-ray, CT scan, or ultrasonography. Analyzing the pleural fluid can show an underlying cause to guide therapy. Fluid is inspected for cell counts, organisms, pH, enzyme activity, and serum glucose concentration and total protein concentrations. Low pH and low serum glucose are indicative of increased cellular metabolism in the fluid and may indicate underlying malignancy and/or infection. Malignant pleural effusions may have increased erythrocyte counts or appear grossly hemorrhagic as a result of tumor invasion and disruption of blood vessels and the visceral pleura. As well, Light criteria assesses whether the pleural effusion is likely to be exudative (eg, complex fluid resulting from pneumonia, empyema, malignancy, or inflammatory disease) or transudative (eg, serous fluid resulting from imbalanced hydrostatic or oncotic pressures) through evaluating the concentrations of pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Congestive heart failure and nephrotic syndrome (Choice C) may be complicated by transudative pleural effusions caused by volume overload. Pleural effusions associated with volume overload are most likely bilateral as a result of the underlying systemic derangement, while exudative effusions related to malignancy or infection are more commonly unilateral. As well, transudative effusions do not demonstrate increased erythrocyte, lactate dehydrogenase, or protein concentrations. Traumatic hemothorax (Choice D) is an exudative effusion that contains increased erythrocyte concentrations and may appear frankly bloody on thoracentesis. It often occurs in the setting of rib fractures and/or pulmonary contusions. Malignant pleural effusion is more likely in the setting of a mediastinal mass on imaging. Tuberculous pleural effusion (Choice E) may be seen in endemic regions in the setting of chronic tuberculosis infection. The pleural fluid is characteristically exudative, with a high lymphocyte count and an increased adenosine deaminase concentration."

      "educational_objective": "Pleural effusions may be categorized as transudative or exudative based on the Light criteria.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Drain cleaners are a common cause of caustic ingestions in children. They contain sodium and potassium hydroxides, alkali that are proton acceptors and strong nucleophiles. Alkali ingestion leads to liquefactive necrosis, lactic acidosis, and tissue penetration and ulceration. It can cause chemical burns and ulcerations of the tongue, airway, and esophagus, resulting in stridor, hoarseness, vomiting, and drooling. If severe, esophageal perforation can result leading to free air in the mediastinum. Treatment is initially focused on supportive measures including airway management and fluid resuscitation. Visible lesions in the oropharynx increase the likelihood of distal gastrointestinal lesions. Patients should be evaluated with endoscopy to assess for visceral injury. For severe injuries, treatment involves steroid administration.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Acetaminophen toxicity is characterized by acute liver failure. At high doses, saturation of phase II metabolic pathways leads to excess acetaminophen being metabolized by cytochrome P450-mediated reactions to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), which has strong oxidizing properties and is directly hepatotoxic.",
        "B": "Diphenhydramine ingestion results in central nervous system H1-receptor blockade, anticholinergic, and anti-a-adrenergic side effects. This results in a constellation of symptoms such as dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, hallucinations, delirium, ataxia, flushed skin, visual disturbances (cycloplegia), and sedation.",
        "D": "Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits cyclooxygenase. In small doses, it can cause impaired gastric mucosal protection resulting in gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. In large overdose or ingestion, ibuprofen can cause hypotension, hypothermia, and metabolic acidosis; however, this is uncommon.",
        "E": "Organophosphates are found in insecticides; exposure can occur transcutaneously, or via inhalation or ingestion. They are a cause of cholinergic excess as they inhibit acetylcholinesterase, which is characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, urination, diaphoresis, salivation, lacrimation, bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, seizures, and muscle weakness.",
        "F": "Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic that activates the adrenergic receptor system and is used as an over-the-counter nasal decongestant because of its effects on nasal vasoconstriction. Ingestion and toxicity can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, restlessness, and anxiety."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The most likely diagnosis in this otherwise healthy patient is transient synovitis of the hip. Transient synovitis is an inflammatory condition involving the synovial lining of weight-bearing joints, with the hip being commonly affected. It classically presents in children recovering from a viral infection with pain on weight-bearing, antalgic gait, refusal to ambulate, tenderness over the joint, and pain elicited with range of motion. Vital signs are generally within normal limits, as are laboratory studies with the exception of increased markers of inflammation such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Antecedent viral infection has been reported in up to 30% of cases of transient synovitis. Diagnosis involves the exclusion of emergent or urgent conditions such as cellulitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and fracture. Treatment is supportive, and involves rest plus nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, making oral ibuprofen the best choice for this patient. If there is diagnostic uncertainty, arthrocentesis to exclude septic arthritis, along with imaging to assess for osteomyelitis or fracture should be conducted.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Oral acyclovir is appropriate for cases of herpetic infections, such as herpes labial is, genital herpes, or varicella infections. Acyclovir is a guanosine analog that must first be activated by viral thymidine kinase, and ultimately prevents replication of the viral genome. It demonstrates no independent anti-inflammatory properties. Oral clindamycin (Choice B), an antibiotic that inhibits the 50S ribosomal subunit, is appropriate for treating cases of skin and soft-tissue infections, and exhibits broad activity against many gram-positive, gram negative, and anaerobic pathogens. Intravenous ceftriaxone (Choice D) and intravenous vancomycin (Choice E) are appropriate for the inpatient treatment of bacterial infections and are a common empiric regimen used to treat meningitis. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a common cause of migratory polyarthritis. Vancomycin inhibits the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, and therefore has the greatest activity against gram-positive organisms. It would be an appropriate choice to treat osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or skin and soft-tissue infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "lntussusception occurs when a segment of bowel telescopes into an adjacent segment, resulting in colicky abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and potential bloody, mucoid stools. Classically, it presents in an infant or young child with recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain often punctuated by asymptomatic periods. lntussusception typically occurs as a result of the presence of a pathologic lead point, often lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphadenopathy, Meckel diverticulum, stricture, or malignancy, which acts to draw one segment of bowel into an adjacent segment during peristalsis. If the intussusception self-resolves, there may be no symptoms. If it does not resolve, traction on mesenteric vessels can result in hypoperfusion of the segment with resultant inflammation, hemorrhage, obstruction, and pain. It may be detected on physical examination as an elongated mass, often in the right upper quadrant. Diagnosis consists of clinical history and physical examination and is supported by imaging. Ultrasonography evaluation is preferred in young children and will show telescoping interposed bowel segments in longitudinal orientation or a targetoid appearance in transverse orientation. Treatment of an ileocolic intussusception requires the administration of a contrast enema, which decreases the intussusception. Contrast enema is both diagnostic and therapeutic in this setting. Surgery may be required in cases where there is repetitive failure of the enema to decrease the intussusception or if the patient presents with symptoms concerning for bowel necrosis or perforation.",

Congenital infection (Choice B) can occur with multiple viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), rubella, measles, or parvovirus. Each congenital viral infection results in different congenital abnormalities. HSV can cause both cutaneous herpetic lesions and systemic manifestations like meningoencephalitis. Congenital infection with CMV manifests as hearing loss, seizures, a petechial rash, intracranial calcifications, organomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Neonates with congenital rubella infection exhibit a classic triad of cataracts, sensorineural deafness, and congenital heart disease. Exposure to alcohol in utero (Choice C) results in fetal alcohol syndrome, which can cause intellectual disability and congenital abnormalities such as microcephaly, facial abnormalities (eg, thin vermillion border, small palpebral fissures), and heart defects. Uteroplacental insufficiency (Choice E) describes insufficient blood flow to the placenta, abnormal placenta, or inability of the placenta to deliver sufficient nutrients to the fetus during pregnancy. It can result in a variety of disorders including fetal hypoglycemia, oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction, or maternal complications including preeclampsia, miscarriage, or stillbirth."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Puberty in boys typically follows a predictable course of gonadarche (enlargement of the testes), followed by pubarche (pubic hair), followed by adrenarche (axillary hair, facial hair, voice changes), followed by a growth spurt. This differs from the process in girls, which proceeds from thelarche (breast buds) to pubarche to growth spurt and finally menarche. In boys, delayed puberty is defined as the absence of testicular enlargement or secondary sexual characteristics at the age of 14 years. The most common cause of delayed puberty is constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), accounting for approximately 50% of cases, a normal variant. In CDGP, there is a transient defect in the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone with resultant delay in the stimulation of pituitary production of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. CDGP tends to be familial with many members of the same family undergoing late puberty compared with peers. In this case, the patient has undergone gonadarche (indicated by his Tanner stage 2 genital development) and pubarche but has not yet undergone adrenarche. Thus, while delayed, the sequence of his procession through the steps of puberty is appropriate and he can be reassured that his development will continue to progress.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Measurement of serum testosterone concentration is unnecessary in this case because the patient is progressing through the stages of puberty as expected. If his puberty did not continue to progress, testosterone measurement could be used to differentiate CDGP from another pathology. Mild bilateral gynecomastia can be normal in early puberty as a result of the small increase in extragonadal production of estrogen relative to the amount of testosterone being produced. Urine toxicology screening (Choice C) would be appropriate if there was a suspicion for drug use inducing gynecomastia, of which marijuana is the most common recreational drug. Breast biopsy (Choice E) would be indicated if the breast enlargement was caused by a nodule or mass rather than true gynecomastia. If delayed puberty were accompanied by neurologic findings or suspected to be caused by a process involving the brain such as a pituitary adenoma, MRI of the brain, not CT scan of the head (Choice D), would be indicated. Neither imaging modality is necessary in this case."

Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs as a result of the relative state of starvation created through absent insulin signaling. Extracellular hyperglycemia creates an osmotic effect resulting in the shift of fluid from the intracellular to the extracellular space with accompanying profuse osmotic diuresis and intracellular volume loss. Patients present with signs and symptoms including tachycardia, tachypnea, fatigue, polyuria, shortness of breath, Kussmaul respiration, and diffuse abdominal discomfort. Laboratory evaluation typically shows increased concentrations of glucose, ketones, and a high anion-gap metabolic acidosis caused by the accumulation of unmeasured anions (ketones, lactic acid) in serum. Treatment is through the replacement of insulin, volume repletion, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions. Insulin is typically repleted at an initial dose of 0.1 U/kg/hour by intravenous infusion. Volume resuscitation with 0.9% saline is essential to restore intracellular fluid volume and lower the extracellular glucose concentration and is the initial step in the management of DKA even prior to insulin administration.

Infusing a fluid with potassium may result in worsening of unknown derangements with potentially life-threatening dysrhythmias. Administration of regular insulin either via intravenous dose at 0.1 U/h (Choice D) or via continuous intravenous infusion at 0.1 U/h (Choice E) is not the best next step because neither of these options are adjusted for the patient's weight. Insulin is typically repleted at an initial dose of 0.1 U/kg/h by intravenous infusion. Intravenous volume repletion with 0.9% saline is therefore a more appropriate initial step. Additionally, insulin repletion is only appropriate in DKA once the serum potassium concentration is known to prevent precipitating life-threatening derangements in potassium."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Measles (rubeola) virus is a highly contagious paramyxovirus that causes the disease measles, which is associated with acute febrile illness and potentially severe sequelae. It is more common in children than adults. It characteristically presents with a prodromal fever along with cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and a confluent maculopapular rash that starts at the head/neck and spreads to the trunk, excluding the palms and soles. Physical examination may show bright red macules with a bluish-white center on the buccal mucosa (Koplik spots) and lymphadenopathy. Treatment is supportive. Vitamin A deficiency is associated with severe disease and complications, and supplementation should be provided, especially in children who are malnourished. Complications of measles include subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (a neurodegenerative disease associated with intellectual regression, personality changes, motor deterioration, seizures, and premature death), encephalitis, and giant cell pneumonia.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "arAntitrypsin deficiency results in the early development of panacinar emphysema and cirrhosis. It is a hereditary disease resulting from misfolding of arantitrypsin. The lack of functional arantitrypsin release results in an imbalance of proteases and antiproteases in the lung parenchyma, resulting in the destruction of alveolar septa and development of panacinar emphysema.",
        "B": "Asthma is characterized by reversible obstruction to airflow caused by the spasm of smooth muscle in the bronchi and small airways, and may present with dyspnea, wheezing, or chronic nonproductive cough. It is often triggered by an allergen (eg, smoke, pollen), exercise, or temperature change. It may be associated with progressive reactive airway remodeling over time. The lack of response to inhaled 13- adrenergic agonists and oral prednisone in this patient do not support the diagnosis of asthma. Congenital emphysema (Choice D) is a rare pulmonary disorder caused by disrupted embryonic bronchopulmonary development and is characterized by air trapping and lung hyperinflation, which can be visualized on chest imaging. The severity of disease varies widely and may be asymptomatic until adulthood or present in the newborn with respiratory distress. Cystic fibrosis (Choice E) is a clinical syndrome resulting from defects in the CFTR gene, leading to a deficiency in a chloride channel that secretes chloride in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract and reabsorbs chloride in sweat glands. Cystic fibrosis is associated with bronchiectasis because of the risk for recurrent pulmonary infections. The absence of other findings associated with cystic fibrosis, such as pancreatic insufficiency, diarrhea, malnutrition, and weight loss, argue against cystic fibrosis as the cause of this patient's bronchiectasis."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Neonatal jaundice is defined as an increased bilirubin concentration (greater than 5 mg/dl), which results from either increased hemolysis {bilirubin generation) or decreased bilirubin conjugation or excretion. Hyperbilirubinemia can be divided into direct and indirect forms in which either conjugated or unconjugated bilirubin accumulate, respectively. It can also be divided into physiologic and pathologic forms. Features of physiologic jaundice include development after 24 hours of life, a rate of bilirubin rise of less than 0.5 mg/dl daily, a maximum peak of 14 to 15 mg/dl, and a predominance of indirect bilirubin (greater than 90%). In contrast, jaundice within the first 24 hours of life {which rises faster than 0.5 mg/dl per hour), a predominance of direct bilirubin, and persistence beyond 2 weeks would suggest a pathologic cause. Newborn physiologic jaundice, also termed benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, occurs in nearly all newborns and is caused by the increased breakdown of red blood cells and thus generation of bilirubin, the immature liver metabolism of bilirubin, and the increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. These features taken together cause an indirect hyperbilirubinemia to develop. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is closely monitored in order to prevent kernicterus, which refers to the deposition of bilirubin in the basal ganglia, pons, and cerebellum. This can occur at bilirubin concentrations of 25 to 30 mg/dl. Treatment of the underlying cause of the jaundice and phototherapy for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia or exchange transfusion prevents this potentially fatal consequence. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. ABO isoimmunization {Choice A) occurs when maternal lgG antibodies to fetal red blood cell antigens cause either fetal or neonatal destruction of these red blood cells. Bilirubin production is increased, and an indirect hyperbilirubinemia ensues. This cause of neonatal jaundice will present with pathologic findings such as an early presentation and rapid rate of rise, neither of which are present in this case. Biliary obstruction {Choice B) caused by biliary atresia is a common cause of direct hyperbilirubinemia. In congenital biliary atresia, the common bile duct is occluded or atretic and bile is unable to pass into the duodenum. Dehydration {Choice C) is the mechanism behind breastfeeding jaundice. In the first week of life, as a breastfeeding mother's milk begins to establish, the infant may become dehydrated. Dehydration leads to increased enterohepatic circulation and reabsorption of bilirubin, resulting in indirect hyperbilirubinemia. In this case, the infant's consistent wet diapers and stools argue against a dehydrated state.

Neonatal jaundice is defined as an increased bilirubin concentration (greater than 5 mg/dl), which results from either increased hemolysis (bilirubin generation) or decreased bilirubin conjugation or excretion. Hyperbilirubinemia can be divided into direct and indirect forms in which either conjugated or unconjugated bilirubin accumulate, respectively.

This cause of neonatal jaundice would present with an early presentation and rapid rate of rise, along with a substantial decrease in the newborn's hematocrit. Polycythemia (Choice F) in a neonate is defined as a hematocrit concentration greater than 65%. This infant's hematocrit is well below this cutoff. Neonates with polycythemia can develop hyperbilirubinemia as a result of increased turnover of excess red blood cells. Educational Objective: Benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, or physiologic jaundice, is caused by the increased breakdown of red blood cells and thus generation of bilirubin, the immature liver metabolism of bilirubin, and the increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. Jaundice within the first 24 hours of life that rises faster than 0.5 mg/dl per hour and a predominance of direct bilirubin are features suggestive of a pathologic cause of hyperbilirubinemia. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 44 of 50 'I 44 .

A patient with fever, hypotension, edematous extremities, cardiomegaly, decreased urine output, and respiratory distress raises suspicion for myocarditis and cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock can occur when decreased cardiac output leads to organ hypoperfusion. In cardiogenic shock, dysfunction of cardiac myocytes results in decreased chronotropy, lusitropy, or inotropy. Decreased cardiac output and increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure result from such dysfunction. Systemic vascular resistance is increased as a physiologic attempt to maintain mean arterial pressure in the setting of decreased cardiac output and peripheral perfusion. Physical examination findings can include tachycardia, tachypnea, crackles on auscultation of the lungs, and an S or S gallop on cardiac auscultation. Dopamine is a vasopressor and 3 4 inotrope at increased doses. Intravenous administration of dopamine may be appropriate in cases of cardiogenic shock or refractory hypotension. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Intravenous administration of an isotonic fluid bolus (Choice A) is typically done initially in cases of distributive or hypovolemic shock. It would be harmful in a patient with cardiogenic shock because of impaired cardiac output and exacerbation of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and it was already empirically attempted in this case. Intravenous administration of furosemide (Choice C) would not be an initial step in the management of cardiogenic shock. Although total body fluid volume is increased (eg, pulmonary edema and extremity edema), cardiac output to the kidneys is decreased. Restoration of cardiac output and mean arterial pressure to prevent further damage to organs is the first priority. Intravenous administration of nitroprusside (Choice D) would be detrimental to this patient who is hypotensive. Nitroprusside is an intravenous, titratable vasodilator that can be used for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. It breaks down in circulation to release nitric oxide, which in turn activates guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscle to result in vascular smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Increased inhaled oxygen concentration (Choice E) would not be beneficial to this patient.

A 17-year-old boy comes to the physician because of swelling of his lower lip that has slowly resolved during the past 2 days . He has a 12-month history of intermittent asymmetric swelling of his face , chest , and arms . During three of the episodes , he also had abdominal pain and diarrhea . There is no history of travel outside the USA. He takes no medications . He does not use illicit drugs . He is not sexually active . Examination shows no abnormalities . Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis? A) Skin testing for environmental allergies B) Measurement of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity C) Measurement of serum C1 esterase inhibitor concentration D) Radioallergosorbent test (RAST) E) Serum protein electrophoresis Correct Answer: C. Hereditary angioedema presents with intermittent episodes of swelling of the skin, face, and lips, as well as the mucosal lining of the respiratory and gastrointestinal system. It is caused by an autosomal dominant inherited or de novo deficiency in C1 esterase inhibitor, which leads to overactivation of the complement system and overproduction of bradykinin. Bradykinin is a vasodilator that leads to the symptoms associated with hereditary angioedema. Episodes of angioedema can be caused by trauma, medications, and infections. They are not improved by antihistamines but commonly self-resolve. Further evaluation would also demonstrate a decreased C4 complement concentration in addition to the decreased concentration or activity of serum C1 esterase inhibitor.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Skin testing for environmental allergies may be useful in the evaluation of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis, which may also present with angioedema. However, anaphylaxis also causes wheezing as a result of laryngeal edema, urticaria, emesis, and hypotension. It is generally acute in onset following a specific exposure. Measurement of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity (Choice B) would not be useful in the evaluation of hereditary angioedema. However, decreased activity of ACE, as can be caused by ACE inhibitor medications, can lead to angioedema as a result of the decreased degradation of bradykinin. ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in hereditary angioedema. Radioallergosorbent test (RAST) (Choice D) is a test used to identify antibodies against particular antigens, although it is no longer commonly used. Because hereditary angioedema is not caused by an allergic reaction, a RAST would not be useful in its evaluation beyond ruling out an allergic contributor which is unlikely on the basis of no specific exposure history. Serum protein electrophoresis (Choice E) is commonly used to evaluate for malignancy (eg, multiple myeloma), as well as kidney and immunological disorders. It is not frequently used to evaluate the complement system and, thus, would have no role in diagnosing hereditary angioedema."

        "A": "Abnormal exocrine secretions from the pancreas and intestinal glands can occur in cystic fibrosis, which is caused by a failure of proper chloride channel function. This leads to inspissated stool and meconium ileus, which can present with abdominal distention but more commonly presents with absence of a bowel movement within the first 48 hours of life. It would not be expected to cause peritonitis, as in this patient. Failure of cannulization of the proximal bowel (Choice B) results in duodenal atresia. It typically presents with signs of intestinal obstruction in the newborn, such as recurrent emesis and poor feeding. It is associated with Down syndrome, polyhydramnios in utero, and a two adjacent contrast filled structures on imaging. This patient was previously able to tolerate oral feeding, making this diagnosis less likely. Failure of caudal migration of ganglion cells (Choice C) causes Hirschsprung disease, which classically presents with the failure to pass stool in the first 48 hours of life. Digital rectal examination commonly demonstrates an explosive release of stool, rather than gross blood, as in this patient. Vascular occlusion in a segment of bowel (Choice E) can result in jejunal or ileal atresia. This most commonly occurs in the setting of maternal smoking or use of cocaine.

A) Abnormal exocrine secretions from the pancreas and intestinal glands B) Failure of cannulization of the proximal bowel C) Failure of caudal migration of ganglion cells D) Failure of normal bowel rotation E) Vascular occlusion in a segment of bowel CorrectAnswer: D. Midgut volvulus, a dangerous complication of intestinal malrotation, often occurs in children within the first few months of life. Malrotation results from the incomplete rotation of the midgut during embryonal development and leaves the midgut attached to a thin stalk of mesentery at the base of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) instead of the normally broad-based mesenteric stalk. The cecum also remains in an abnormal position within the mid-upper abdomen instead of the right lower quadrant and is attached to the lateral abdominal wall by fibrous bands which cross over the top of the duodenum and can also cause constriction. This leaves the small intestine at risk for volvulus at the base of the SMA. Volvulus can lead to bilious vomiting, abdominal distention, and vascular compromise of the small bowel with consequent intestinal necrosis, hematochezia, perforation, and peritonitis. The SMA is susceptible to constriction in midgut volvulus because of its anatomical proximity and embryonal relationship to the formation of the midgut. Evaluation of malrotation and midgut volvulus requires an upper gastrointestinal barium study, which will outline the patient's small bowel anatomy and further assess for the presence of an obstructive volvulus. The upper gastrointestinal barium study in this patient demonstrates a spiral appearance of the duodenum with an abnormal position of the duodenojejunal junction on the lateral view, which indicates the presence of malrotation with a midgut volvulus. Treatment requires emergent surgical correction. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Kernicterus occurs as a result of the deposition of unconjugated bilirubin in a newborn's brain, usually in the basal ganglia, pons, and cerebellum. It typically presents with poor feeding, lethargy, and seizures. If untreated, it can cause long-term neurologic abnormalities, such as gaze palsies or sensorineural hearing loss. Unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is circulating insoluble bilirubin that is largely bound to albumin. It has not yet undergone conjugation in the liver. Causes of increased unconjugated bilirubin include hemolysis, breast milk jaundice, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, Gilbert syndrome, and physiologic jaundice. In newborns, causes also include maternal exposure to sulfonamide antibiotics, which displace bilirubin from albumin in the neonate, thereby increasing the free plasma concentrations of unconjugated bilirubin. Kernicterus typically occurs when the bilirubin concentration exceeds 25-30 mg/dL, which is commonly caused by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or Rh-hemolytic disease of the newborn, the latter of which was likely present in this patient given the discordant Rh status of him and his mother. Risk factors include prematurity, cephalohematoma or significant bruising, poor breastfeeding, and East Asian ethnicity. Treatment to prevent severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and subsequent kernicterus is phototherapy or exchange transfusion. Exchange transfusions are particularly useful in hyperbilirubinemia that is caused by anti-Rh(D) antibodies, as they allow removal of the antibodies as well as the bilirubin.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "feeding could be considered in breast milk jaundice or breastfeeding jaundice, although it is usually not required as the increased bilirubin concentrations seen are typically benign. Breast milk jaundice is hypothesized to occur because of the presence of beta-glucuronidase in breast milk, which deconjugates bilirubin and allows it to be reabsorbed. Breastfeeding jaundice occurs as a result of relative hypovolemia secondary to inadequate intake, which results in hyperbilirubinemia. Water supplementation (Choice B) is generally not advised in infants, as their kidneys are incapable of properly reabsorbing sodium, which results in hyponatremia. This can cause altered mental status and seizures. Water supplementation is not used to treat hyperbilirubinemia. Longer course of phototherapy (Choice C) could have decreased the overall amount of unconjugated bilirubin, as phototherapy converts indirect bilirubin into a water-soluble form that can be excreted. However, it would have been less effective in this patient with severe hyperbilirubinemia likely secondary to anti-Rh(D) antibody-mediated hemolysis. Antibiotic therapy (Choice D) is used in the treatment of neonatal infections, such as Escherichia coli or Streptococcus aga/actiae meningitis. Bacterial meningitis is associated with a high mortality if untreated, as well as prolonged neurologic complications, such as hearing loss, even when treated. A missed diagnosis of bacterial meningitis would have certainly led to neonatal demise or significant morbidity."

The disease has an autoimmune cause and is characterized by joint pain and inflammation. Patients commonly exhibit extra-articular manifestations such as uveitis, lymphadenopathy, and rash. There are a variety of sub-categories of JIA. For example, oligoarticular disease is characterized by the involvement of fewer than five joints (typically large joints such as the knee) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity; polyarticular disease is characterized by involvement of greater than five joints (typically both large and small joints such as the interphalangeal joints), uveitis, and negative ANA titers, and systemic disease (also known as juvenile onset Still disease) is characterized by variable joint involvement, rash, quotidian fever, and serositis. Diagnosis is often difficult and is based on a combination of characteristic clinical findings and suggestive laboratory tests, such as ANA, rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated peptide, and inflammatory tests such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate. There is no single, confirmatory laboratory test for JIA.

Septic arthritis (Choice C) is most commonly bacterial and presents with the rapid onset of fever, joint swelling, erythema, pain, tenderness with range of motion, inability to bear weight, and leukocytosis. Arthrocentesis typically shows bacteria on Gram stain, most often Gram-positive organisms, and leukocyte count is greater than or equal to 50,000/mm 3 with a neutrophilic predominance. Tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (Choice D) commonly presents as an acute injury in athletes when attempting rapid changes in direction upon a planted foot. Patients often report an audible pop when the injury is sustained and experience acute onset of pain, joint swelling, and instability. Tibia vara (Choice E) refers to an outward-bowing deformity of the tibia. It commonly occurs in children with vitamin D deficiency (rickets) or Blount disease.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) typically occurs in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus as a result of increased insulin requirements during times of physiologic stress (eg, infection) or insulin nonadherence. DKA occurs as a result of the accumulation of serum ketones in the setting of deficient insulin signaling. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs because of the relative state of starvation created through absent insulin signaling. Patients may present with complaints of fatigue, polyuria, shortness of breath, and diffuse abdominal discomfort. Vital signs may show tachycardia and tachypnea. Laboratory studies typically show increased glucose and ketone concentrations, metabolic acidosis, and a high anion-gap caused by the accumulation of unmeasured anions in serum. In metabolic acidosis, excess hydrogen ions are transported into the cell in exchange for potassium ions to maintain electroneutrality. Insulin promotes intracellular potassium entry, and in DKA, insulin deficiency contributes to the excess cellular shift of potassium to the extracellular space resulting in hyperkalemia despite decreased concentrations of total body potassium as a result of excess urinary excretion. Treatment is through replacement of insulin, volume repletion, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Adrenal insufficiency (Choice A) refers to insufficient production of hormones from the adrenal cortex, which include aldosterone and cortisol; sex hormone deficiency may also be present. Primary adrenal insufficiency can present with deficiencies in both aldosterone and cortisol, whereas secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency tend to affect cortisol only. Insufficient aldosterone production leads to hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Insufficient cortisol can lead to hypoglycemia, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, and depressed mental status. In this patient, DKA is more likely given his history of type 1 diabetes, metabolic acidosis, and hyperglycemia. Excessive potassium intake (Choice C) would be unlikely to cause hyperkalemia in this patient. Kidney potassium filtration typically regulates serum potassium within a normal range, but this can be impaired in end stage kidney disease. In DKA, the kidney excretion of potassium is increased because of osmotic diuresis. Hyperkalemia in this case is as a result of the extracellular shift of potassium and deficient insulin signaling. Hemolysis (Choice D) can result in hyperkalemia because of the release of intracellular potassium into the serum. DKA is unlikely to cause hemolysis. Hemolytic anemia may present with jaundice and increased bilirubin. Respiratory acidosis (Choice E) would be the opposite of what is expected in a patient with DKA. In DKA, metabolic acidosis leads to compensatory respiratory alkalosis. Kussmaul respirations, which are rapid and deep, are a classic physical examination finding.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Gynecomastia refers to an increase in the amount of glandular breast tissue in males, and it is common during puberty. Pubertal gynecomastia is caused by a disruption in the normal balance of androgens and estrogens and is common in boys aged 12 to 14 years old, typically when they have a sexual maturity rating of 3, as in this patient. The increased concentrations of estrogen are caused by the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone to estrone and estradiol. On physical examination, gynecomastia may be tender to palpation. Results of laboratory studies will be within reference ranges in pubertal gynecomastia but could be used to delineate other causes of gynecomastia. These other causes include medications (eg, spironolactone, ketoconazole, antiandrogen therapy), liver cirrhosis, germ cell tumors, hypogonadism, and hyperthyroidism. Physiologic gynecomastia typically self-resolves but medical and surgical options exist for symptomatic patients, such as aromatase inhibitors and liposuction. As this patient has no signs to suggest pathologic gynecomastia, reassurance is appropriate.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Measuring serum corticosteroid concentrations may be useful in the evaluation of suspected Cushing syndrome (high concentrations of baseline cortisol) or Addison disease (deficiency of cortisol). Cushing syndrome presents with weight gain, fatigue, truncal obesity, fat redistribution, hirsutism, and abdominal striae, whereas Addison disease presents with hypotension, hypoglycemia, hyperpigmentation, and abdominal pain. Neither present with gynecomastia as a direct result, though truncal obesity may resemble it in Cushing syndrome (or in Cushing disease). Measuring serum gonadotropin concentrations (Choice B) may be useful in the evaluation of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, such as Klinefelter syndrome, which can present with gynecomastia. However, patients with Klinefelter syndrome typically have testicular atrophy, tall stature, and long extremities, which this patient does not exhibit. Evaluating his brother for this finding (Choice C) may be useful if the gynecomastia was because of a hereditary disorder, such as partial androgen insensitivity or aromatase excess. However, this patient is presenting with mild gynecomastia associated with puberty, making physiologic gynecomastia more likely. Privately telling his parents about the finding (Choice D) is inappropriate, as the condition is benign, and the patient should be included in health conversations regarding his body."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Congenital melanocytic nevus (CMN) is a benign proliferation of melanocytes that is present from birth. Compared to normal skin, within a nevus the melanocytes are clustered into nests. Nests are either located in the basal layer of the epidermis, in the dermis, or both. Compared to acquired nevi, CMN are often larger and darker. CMN are classified by their size: small (<1.5 cm), medium (1.5-20 cm), large (>20-40 cm), and giant (>40 cm). Large and giant CMN are at risk for malignant transformation. In this case, the CMN is symmetrical, uniform in color and thickness, and appears to have a rough texture. Hair is present on the inferior aspect which is common in CMN. CMN should be routinely monitored by a dermatologist. If an area within the CMN develops increased thickness or change in color, it should be biopsied to evaluate for presence of melanoma. Provided the CMN does not develop melanoma, they are benign. However, they can be associated with psychological morbidity if they are located in cosmetically sensitive areas of the body and depending on their size. Complete surgical excision of large or giant CMN is usually impossible, but particularly bothersome areas may be excised to improve function and cosmesis.",

        "B": "Hyperpigmented macula describe cafe-au-lait spots. A cafe-au-lait spot is characterized by a tan to dark brown, uniformly pigmented macule or patch often seen at birth or noticed in early childhood. This lesion, in contrast, is a dark brown plaque with the presence of hair at the inferior aspect. It may be asymmetrical or have an irregular border. It represents a focal increase in melanin production rather than an increased number of melanocytes or any form of malignancy. While numerous cafe-au-lait spots suggest an underlying genetic disease, a single lesion is a normal finding. Macular stain (Choice C), port-wine stain (Choice D), and superficial hemangioma (Choice E) are all vascular lesions and will appear red to purple rather than brown to black. Macular stains, or nevi flammeus, are common red patches present on the forehead and posterior neck at birth. Port-wine stain and nevus flammeus are both capillary malformations while superficial hemangioma is a benign proliferation of capillary sized vessels. These lesions are benign, but superficial hemangiomas may ulcerate and bleed. Both port-wine stains and superficial hemangiomas can be treated with laser therapy to decrease the size and color if desired. Nevus flammeus on the forehead and eyelids commonly resolves and those on the posterior neck usually fade but do not completely disappear."

The diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is made based on clinical symptoms. Pruritus must be present in addition to three of the following: current or past flexural eczema, history of asthma or hay fever, or presence of dry skin within the past year. The rash is initially characterized by erythematous papules and vesicles with exudates and crusting. With chronic scratching, they become dry, scaly, and excoriated in a process called lichenification. This patient's flexural dermatitis and apparent asthma and hay fever suggest a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis. Treatment of atopic dermatitis begins with gentle skin care: minimizing long baths in warm water which causes drying of the skin, avoiding products with fragrance, and use of bland moisturizers such as petroleum jelly daily. Flares of eczema are treated with mild to moderate potency topical corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "lgA deficiency is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms. Selective lgA deficiency describes a decreased or absent concentration of circulating lgA with normal concentrations of lgG, and normal or increased concentrations of lgM. lgA is critical for immune health and functions in two primary ways. First, lgA binds pathogen surface antigens targeting them for opsonization, complement activation, and phagocytosis. Second, lgA coats mucosal surfaces and prevents colonization, adhesion, and invasion by pathogenic microorganisms. lmmunoglobulins are produced by plasma cells, which are terminally differentiated B lymphocytes; as a result, most causal deficiencies are hypothesized to be related to B lymphocyte abnormalities. Despite this, there is clinical heterogeneity in the severity of lgA deficiency. Some patients remain asymptomatic while others suffer from recurrent sinopulmonary infections or otitis media, as is the case for this patient. In younger patients with severe deficiency, failure to thrive is common. Anaphylactic reactions to blood products such as plasma (which contain donor immunoglobulin) are classic but uncommon, as not all patients with lgA deficiency have reactions to blood products. Such severe reactions are most common in patients with undetectable concentrations of lgA; these reactions occur because of the presence of preformed antibodies against lgA, which is a non-native protein in these patients, and thus, a target of immune activation.",

These patients have abnormal Th T-lymphocyte function and thus, impaired release of IL-17, a 17 potent agent for neutrophil chemotaxis. These patients present with recurrent abscesses with minimal inflammation. Impaired respiratory burst (Choice C) describes chronic granulomatous disease, which is caused by a deficiency in NADPH oxidase, an enzyme used to generate hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid. These molecules are typically used to kill bacteria intracellularly. Patients present with recurrent pyogenic infections with catalase-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, with normal concentrations of leukocytes and immunoglobulins. Splenic dysfunction (Choice D) can be the consequence of splenectomy or can occur in diseases such as sickle cell disease, where patients become functionally asplenic early in the course of disease. This predisposes to infection with encapsulated organisms such as Haemophi/us influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. lgA deficiency is the more likely diagnosis for this patient. T-lymphocyte dysfunction (Choice E) describes numerous disorders affecting either T-lymphocyte maturation, survival, or function. Conditions such as severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCIO) or Di George syndrome result in a near absence of T lymphocytes with recurrent viral and fungal infections. T lymphocytes also play a role in augmenting B-lymphocyte activation, so deficiency or dysfunction can impair humoral immunity. These patients present with severe and recurrent invasive infections early in life."

Thalassemia is characterized by the decreased synthesis of globin chains. Normal adult hemoglobin is known as HbA (a~2l and is made of two a-globin chains and two ~-globin chains. There are four a-globin alleles and two ~-globin alleles. Mutations in one or two a-globin alleles or one ~-globin allele causes thalassemia minor. Thalassemia trait is common in Southeast Asia and presents with mild microcytic anemia. Features include the presence of target cells on peripheral blood smear (pictured in the photomicrograph above), a low RDW (which indicates that most erythrocytes are of the same size with little variation), and persistence of microcytosis. Iron concentrations can be measured to rule out iron deficiency. Other cell lines including platelets and white blood cells should be within normal ranges.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "lgA nephropathy (Berger disease) is a type of nephritic syndrome resulting in episodic gross hematuria, often following an upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract infection. Nephritic syndromes typically present with acute kidney injury with associated hematuria, red blood cell casts, and hypertension. On urinalysis, there will be a significant quantity of red blood cells (RBCs), possible RBC casts, and sub-nephrotic range proteinuria. Serum complement concentrations, including C3, are typically within reference ranges. This differentiates lgA nephropathy from postinfectious glomerulonephritis, which results in decreased serum C3 complement. Additionally, anti-streptolysin O and anti-DNase titers will be negative in lgA nephropathy. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Hemolytic uremic syndrome {Choice A) is caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (O157:H?) and is usually accompanied by bloody diarrhea. This is characterized by a classic triad of thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Hemorrhagic cystitis {Choice B) refers to inflammation of the urinary bladder, which commonly is secondary to an acute bacterial urinary tract infection presenting with dysuria, urinary urgency, and frequency. A typical infectious cystitis presents with increased urinary white blood cells with detectable leukocyte esterase and nitrites on urinalysis, depending on the infectious organism. In hemorrhagic cystitis, red blood cells are also present on urinalysis. Nephrotic syndrome {Choice D) typically presents with excessive proteinuria (>3 g/day) hyperlipidemia, hypoalbuminemia, and peripheral edema. It does not cause hematuria. The most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is minimal change disease. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis {Choice E) is a nephritic syndrome presenting with urinary RBCs and RBC casts, which typically occurs between 2 and 6 weeks after infection with group A ~-hemolytic streptococci. Results of laboratory studies will show decreased serum C3 concentrations, and anti-streptolysin O and anti-DNase titers are positive.

Inferior vena cava obstruction (Choice C) causes the obstruction of venous drainage from the lower regions of the body, often related to an underlying malignancy and associated mass effect, thrombosis from an indwelling catheter, or as a result of compression by a gravid uterus.

Cystic fibrosis does not commonly cause nephrotic syndrome. Protein-losing enteropathy (Choice F) refers to any gastrointestinal pathology that results in the loss of protein, which may present with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and peripheral edema. Potential causes include inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and amyloidosis. Cystic fibrosis may cause steatorrhea. Vitamin E deficiency (Choice G) presents with hemolytic anemia and generalized muscle weakness.

A 2-month -old infant has a large posterior fontanelle , a large tongue , and hypotonia. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation; pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. Apgar scores were 7 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes , respectively . Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of disease? A) Anterior horn cell degeneration B) Connective tissue disorder C) Cortical dysfunction D) Electrolyte imbalance E) Myopathy F) Peripheral neuropathy G) Spinal cord dysfunction H) Thyroid dysfunction CorrectAnswer: H. Congenital thyroid dysfunction that leads to hypothyroidism is typically asymptomatic at birth. This is because maternal thyroid hormone is able to cross the placenta, which keeps the newborn in a euthyroid state. Congenital hypothyroidism commonly presents in the first few months of life with feeding difficulties, lethargy, constipation, myxedematous facies, macroglossia, large fontanelles, hypotonia, and hypothermia. Infants with this disorder may also present with goiter, or congenital cardiac, kidney, or gastrointestinal malformations. Thyroid dysfunction can be caused by a variety of mechanisms, including thyroid dysgenesis, resistance to thyroid-stimulating hormone, abnormalities in thyroid hormone transport, iodine deficiency, maternal antibodies, or antithyroid medications. Congenital hypothyroidism is now typically identified on routine newborn screening. It is treated with thyroid hormone supplementation (eg, levothyroxine) but can lead to intellectual disability or neurologic issues (eg, hearing loss, ataxia) if untreated. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Anterior horn cell degeneration (Choice A) is seen in spinal muscular atrophy, which presents with hypotonia and weakness in the newborn. It can also present with a weak cry, difficulty feeding, and respiratory failure, which are not seen in this patient. Connective tissue disorders (Choice B) include Ehlers-Danlos and Marfan syndrome. These are not typically apparent at birth, rather manifesting later as hyperflexiblity and skin elasticity (Ehlers-Danlos) or tall stature with long extremities and fingers (Marfan syndrome). They are not associated with macroglossia or a large posterior fontanelle. Cortical dysfunction (Choice C) can occur secondary to cerebral palsy, intracranial hemorrhage, or a variety of other neurologic conditions. It would be expected to present more broadly with intellectual disability or developmental delay, as well neuromuscular abnormalities such as unilateral weakness or spastic paralysis. Electrolyte imbalances (Choice D) can lead to cardiac irritability (potassium, magnesium, calcium), skeletal abnormalities (calcium), altered mental status or neurologic abnormalities (sodium, calcium), and neuromuscular weakness (potassium, magnesium). Changes in electrolyte concentrations would not be expected to present with a large posterior fontanelle and tongue. Myopathy (Choice E) generally presents with muscle weakness, rather than hypotonia, although the latter can also be present. If present at 2 months of age, the diagnosis would likely be congenital myopathy. Depending on the subtype, congenital myopathies can present with a variety of symptoms and anatomic abnormalities, such as respiratory failure or scoliosis, although these do not include a large posterior fontanelle or macroglossia. Peripheral neuropathy (Choice F) commonly presents with paresthesias, numbness, or weakness in the extremities, and it can be caused by congenital disorders, diabetes mellitus, injury, or infection. It would not be expected to present with a large posterior fontanelle and tongue. Spinal cord dysfunction (Choice G) could present with weakness, numbness, paresthesias, or autonomic instability. However, it would be unlikely to cause anatomic changes superior to the area of dysfunction. Educational Objective: Congenital hypothyroidism presents in the first few months of life with feeding difficulties, lethargy, constipation, myxedematous facies, macroglossia, large fontanelles, hypotonia, and hypothermia. r \" , r-- r ,",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Methemoglobinemia occurs when an abnormal fraction of heme iron in the blood exists in the ferric (Fe 3 form (methemoglobin). Methemoglobin cannot effectively bind oxygen, which impairs tissue oxygen delivery. •) Most cases of methemoglobinemia are acquired, typically via exposure to an oxidant stressor such as an anesthetic (eg, benzocaine), nitrate, or dapsone. Symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, lethargy, lightheadedness, and in severe cases, arrhythmia, seizure, and multisystem organ failure. Vital signs typically show reduced oxygen saturation, and examination may disclose cyanosis. Characteristically, blood appears darkened on gross visualization, although hemoglobin concentration and erythrocyte morphology are normal. Treatment includes supplemental oxygen plus the intravenous administration of methylene blue, a reducing agent that donates electrons to heme. The reduction of heme iron to the ferrous (Fe 2 form restores the ability of hemoglobin to bind, carry, and deliver oxygen to tissues. •) lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, E, and F. Administration of atropine (Choice A) would be indicated in cases of symptomatic bradycardia or organophosphate poisoning. This patient's pulse is tachycardic and atropine administration would be inappropriate. Administration of deferoxamine (Choice B) is indicated in the treatment of hemochromatosis or iron toxicity. It is a therapy that binds free iron in the serum and promotes elimination in the urine. Administration of naloxone (Choice D) is indicated in cases of opioid overdose. Opioid overdoses are characterized by respiratory depression presenting as a decreased respiratory rate, apnea, and hypoxia. This patient's hypoxia is caused by methemoglobinemia, not respiratory depression. Administration of pyridostigmine (Choice E) is used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Observation of proper hand-washing techniques is the most effective strategy to limit the spread of nosocomial enteric viral pathogens. Viral shedding in the stool can occur prior to the development of symptoms and potentially allow asymptomatic patients to become vectors for disease. Additionally, viral shedding in the stool persists until after the resolution of symptoms. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not as efficacious at removing enteric viruses from the hands or other commonly touched surfaces, although cleaning agents that utilize bleach are effective. It is likely that the 10-day-old newborn acquired rotavirus infection after caregivers came in contact with a surface contaminated by feces from the 2-month-old infant and then touched the younger child without washing their hands properly. Spread of enteric viruses can be reduced by simply by performing routine hand washing, which typically involves rubbing the hands together with soap for at least twenty seconds. Individuals often neglect to scrub the entire surface of the hand despite an adequate duration of hand washing.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Disposing of diapers and other waste items properly is also important, as rotavirus is shed in the stool, but adherence to these measures tends to be higher amongst caregivers than the simple observance of hand washing. It is unlikely that the patient acquired infection directly through contact with the other patient's diapers; caregivers more likely touched other contaminated surfaces. Observing gown and glove precautions (Choice B) is an important part of preventing the spread of certain bacteria and viruses, and contact precautions are often instituted in instances of viral gastroenteritis. However, proper hand washing should always occur before and after donning and doffing gown and gloves. Placing the patient in a reverse airflow room (Choice D) would have little effect on the transmission of rotavirus as this pathogen is not transmitted by aerosolized particles. Negative pressure rooms are more commonly reserved for airborne pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and measles, among others. Restricting visitors to the room (Choice E) decreases the number of individuals who can potentially act as vectors to transfer rotavirus between the patients, but observing proper hand washing is more likely to reduce the spread of infection regardless of the number of visitors."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient with generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, diarrhea, and hepatosplenomegaly with leukopenia most likely has acute HIV infection, known as acute retroviral syndrome. The presentation of primary HIV infection can vary significantly between patients, with some experiencing a mild febrile illness while others experience a severe, mononucleosis-like viral syndrome. The time between infection and onset of symptoms is variable, with incubation time lasting several weeks to months. During acute infection, there is a high degree of viral replication followed by widespread infection of CD4+ T lymphocytes. While the T lymphocyte count may decrease transiently, it is often within reference ranges in early HIV infection unless patients present with signs of opportunistic infection. Initial laboratory studies include the use of a fourth generation HIV test, which tests for HIV p24 antigen and antibodies, combined with direct measurement of the HIV viral load using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. It is common in early infection for patients to have a negative fourth generation test but a high viral load; this is known as the window period. Once the diagnosis is made, laboratory studies should be sent for mutational analysis and genotyping, but this should not delay immediate treatment with antiretroviral therapy. Therapy typically includes a combination of at least three different medications from at least two different antiretroviral classes. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, E, and F.

This patient's age and absence of prior recurrent infections essentially rules out this diagnosis. Thymic-parathyroid dysplasia (DiGeorge syndrome) (Choice E) is caused by a 22q11 deletion that leads to failure of the third and fourth branchial pouches to develop. These structures give rise to the thymus and parathyroid glands, and their absence leads to thymic aplasia and hypocalcemia in cardiac and craniofacial defects. Patients are susceptible to viral and fungal infections. The definitive diagnosis requires fluorescence in-situ hybridization to detect the missing DNA segment. X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Choice F) occurs as a result of mutations in the BTK gene that encodes a tyrosine kinase essential for all stages of B lymphocyte development and proliferation. Patients lack functioning B lymphocytes and therefore lack normal concentrations of immunoglobulins. This patient exhibits normal concentrations of all immunoglobulins. Educational Objective: Acute retroviral syndrome, or acute HIV infection, commonly presents with diffuse lymphadenopathy, diarrhea, malaise, fever, and weight loss.

Human placental lactogen produced by the placenta increases maternal insulin resistance. This leads to increased concentrations of glucose in the maternal circulation, and subsequently the fetal circulation. Fetal hyperglycemia in turn causes the fetus to produce excess insulin, with a consequent decrease in the rate of gluconeogenesis. The insulin then acts as a growth factor, leading to macrosomia, and inhibits the production of surfactant, which leads to respiratory distress syndrome. After birth, the fetus continues to synthesize insulin but is no longer exposed to maternal blood glucose concentrations, leading to hypoglycemia.

Increased glucagon secretion (Choice C) would cause neonatal hyperglycemia, as its main mechanism of action is to increase plasma glucose. Eventually, glucagon secretion will increase, and insulin secretion will decrease, which will return the blood glucose concentrations to normal reference ranges. Increased gluconeogenesis (Choice D) would increase the plasma glucose concentration and would occur with increased glucagon. This patient is presenting with hypoglycemia as a result of excessive insulin secretion. Insulin resistance (Choice F) would present with hyperglycemia and is seen in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Cyanosis of the extremities and delayed capillary refill time are manifestations of mild hypothermia. Neonates, particularly preterm neonates, have a high body surface area relative to their mass which makes them prone to rapid heat loss and the development of hypothermia. Neonatal hypothermia requires prompt correction as it is associated with increased mortality. Hypothermia increases oxygen consumption and metabolic demands on the neonate which leads to less successful resuscitation efforts if they are needed. Interventions directed at temperature regulation immediately after delivery include increasing the temperature of the delivery room, placing the neonate in skin-to-skin contact with its mother immediately after birth, using a radiant heater during resuscitation, and swaddling after drying.",

This infant is mildly cyanotic in the extremities because of the vasoconstrictive response to the cold environment, not as a result of respiratory distress or a congenital heart defect. Respirations of 36/min and an oxygen saturation of 96% are within normal limits, and cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Thus, neither a chest x-ray (Choice C) nor intubation and mechanical ventilation (Choice E) are needed at this time.

Neurocysticercosis (Choice D) is an infection caused by the parasitic pork tapeworm Taenia solium that occurs most commonly in endemic rural regions of Latin America, Asia, and Africa. It can present with findings similar to bacterial meningitis, as well as muscle or subcutaneous nodules. A CT scan will show cystic, ring-enhancing, calcified lesions in the brain parenchyma, meninges, ventricles, spinal cord, and/or orbit. Tuberculous meningitis (Choice F) typically presents in a more subacute fashion than bacterial meningitis and is more frequently associated with cranial nerve palsies. In children, seizures are common. CSF evaluation will show a predominance of lymphocytes, unlike in this patient.

An 8-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of fever , progressive cough , and sputum production . Examination at birth showed no abnormalities , but she has a history of respiratory problems since infancy. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 100/min , and respirations are 32/min . Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 84%. Examination shows clubbing , circumoral cyanosis , and a hyperexpanded chest. There are diffuse rhonchi bilaterally with end-expiratory wheezing . An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation , scattered atelectasis , and chronic interstitial changes . CorrectAnswer: D. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the CFTR gene, leading to a deficiency in a chloride channel that secretes chloride in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract and reabsorbs chloride in sweat glands. This abnormal chloride transport causes decreased chloride and water secretion and increased water reabsorption, leading to abnormally viscous mucous. The thick mucus in the gastrointestinal tract contributes to pancreatic insufficiency, steatorrhea, and malabsorption, leading to a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. In the lungs, the disease manifests as recurrent pneumonia, especially with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Repeat antibiotic exposure increases the risk for colonization with resistant organisms. Obstruction and destruction of the airways leads to hypoxemia, air trapping, and bronchiectasis. Physical examination may disclose hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (clubbing), cyanosis, rales and rhonchi, and hyperresonance to percussion of the chest. X-ray findings include hyperinflation, bronchiectasis with peribronchial cuffing, and diffuse nonspecific inflammatory changes.",

These disorders are often subdivided into cyanotic and non-cyanotic\ntypes depending on the direction of blood shunting. Structural heart defects that result in flow of deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary to systemic circulations (a right-to-left shunt) classically present with cyanosis,\nrespiratory distress, hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension generally within a few days of birth. Common culprit lesions include truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great vessels, tricuspid atresia, tetralogy of\nFallo!, and total anomalous pulmonary venous return. Left-to-right shunting occurs with ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, and patent ductus arteriosus. The chronic additional influx of blood into the pulmonary\ncirculation can result in pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy over time with reversal of the shunt to right-to-left (Eisenmenger syndrome). Patients typically present with dyspnea on exertion and cyanosis .\nIncorrect Answers: A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K.\nAsthma (Choice A) is characterized by reversible obstruction to airflow caused by the spasm of smooth muscle in the small airways. It is often triggered by an allergen (eg, smoke, pollen), exercise, or temperature change.\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia (Choice B) is a neonatal lung disorder associated with oxygen exposure and mechanical ventilation in preterm infants. The lungs fail to mature properly, and patients develop chronic lung disease\ncharacterized by decreased lung volumes, hyperinflation, and atelectasis.\nCystic fibrosis (Choice D) can result in cyanosis as a result of chronic lung infections with obstruction and chronic inflammatory changes to the lung parenchyma. Patients typically present with recurrent pneumonia and\ngastrointestinal symptoms.\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Choice E) is a congenital heart condition characterized by myocardial thickening and left outflow tract obstruction. Patients typically present with a murmur and may develop diastolic dysfunction .\nIdiopathic pulmonary hypertension (Choice F) is a rare pulmonary disorder with an unknown cause characterized by progressive pulmonary vascular hypertension. Persistent pulmonary hypertension (Choice I) with any cause\nmay result in right heart failure. Patients typically present with exertional dyspnea and physical examination findings suggestive of right heart failure.\nMethemoglobinemia (Choice G) is the accumulation of hemoglobin with an oxidized iron atom that is unable to transport oxygen, resulting in hypoxia. Infants are more susceptible than adults. It is associated with exposure to\nan oxidizing agent.\nPatent foramen ovale (Choice H) is a common form of atrial septal defect that is typically asymptomatic but can result in a left-to-right shunt and potential for systemic embolization of venous thromboses. Physical examination\nmay disclose wide, fixed splitting of the S heart sound.\n2\nPneumococcal pneumonia (Choice J) is a common infection of the lung parenchyma.

Anaphylaxis is a form of distributive shock, which is characterized by a primary reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). This reduction in SVR is secondary to lgE-mediated histamine and cytokine release. Cardiac output increases to compensate for low SVR in the early stages of distributive shock. If the inciting state is not appropriately treated, further decompensation can occur, resulting in progressive hypotension and insufficient perfusion with associated end-organ damage. After the administration of epinephrine, fluid resuscitation should be initiated to increase intravascular volume to support adequate organ perfusion.",

Causative organisms in the pediatric population depend on the age of the patient. In the neonatal period, patients are at risk for infection from microbes present in the vaginal canal including Streptococcus agalactiae (group B), Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. In patients between the ages of 2 and 5 years, viral pneumonia is most common. Bacterial pathogens include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Staphylococcus aureus. The risk for H. influenzae type b infection is reduced in patients with up-to-date immunizations. Staphylococcus aureus commonly expresses beta-lactamases, which confer resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics such as amoxicillin, and combination therapy with a beta-lactam or a beta-lactamase inhibitor (eg, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) is recommended.

Areas with widespread childhood immunization have significantly lower risk for contracting H. influenzae pneumonia. Mycobacterium avium-intracel/ulare (Choice C) is a non-tuberculosis acid-fast bacillus that may cause pneumonia when organisms are inhaled from the environment. Severe and disseminated disease can occur in immunocompromised patients. Staphylococcus aureus is a more common cause of pneumonia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Choice D) is a Gram-negative bacillus ubiquitous in the environment.

Prepatellar bursitis (Choice D) refers to inflammation of the bursa overlying the patella. Common causes include infection, trauma, and recurrent pressure (as from occupations that require frequent kneeling). A bone scan would show no abnormalities. Septic arthritis (Choice E) results from bacterial infection of the synovial joint space, most commonly by S. aureus. The affected joint demonstrates pain, swelling, and erythema. Arthrocentesis is indicated for the evaluation of monoarticular erythema and swelling to evaluate for septic arthritis, which characteristically shows purulent synovial fluid with >50,000 WBC/mm 3 Physical examination would disclose a tender, • erythematous, and edematous joint, which is not present in this case."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Galactosemia is the most likely diagnosis in this exclusively breast-fed patient with hepatomegaly and the presence of reducing substances in the urine. Normal metabolism of lactose involves separation into glucose and galactose by lactase. Free glucose can be used for cellular energy production while galactose must be converted to galactose-1-phosphate by galactokinase and then subsequently converted to UDP-galactose and then glucose-1-phosphate by galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT). While galactosemia can result from deficiencies in several different enzymes in this pathway, deficiency of GALT causes classic galactosemia, which is an autosomal recessive disorder. Breast milk contains galactose, which patients with galactosemia are unable to break down. Early complications include jaundice, vomiting, hepatomegaly, diarrhea, lethargy, and occasionally sepsis with Gram-negative organisms. Coagulopathy and easy bruising may also occur. Diagnosis is made by assessing for the presence and activity of GALT in erythrocytes by radioimmunoassay. Reducing substances are molecules that can convert cupric to cuprous ions in the urine and include glucose, lactose, pentose, and galactose. The presence of these substances (galactose) can suggest the diagnosis but is not specific. Additionally, while galactosemia is detected on newborn screening, manifestations of the disease can occur before the results of screening are available. Treatment requires eliminating dietary galactose and providing necessary supplements, however, this may not reverse neurologic sequelae of the disease, such as infantile cataracts and intellectual disability.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Hereditary fructose intolerance is caused by a deficiency in aldolase B, an enzyme important in the metabolism of fructose. Deficiency results in increased concentrations offructose-1-phosphate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, causing a deficiency of available phosphate, which inhibits gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Patients present with hypoglycemia only after fructose is introduced into the diet. Mucopolysaccharidosis II (Choice C), also known as Hunter syndrome, is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in iduronate-2-sulfatase, which results in the deposition of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Within the first year of life, patients develop coarse facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, hernias, and dysostosis multiplex. Type I glycogen storage disease (Choice D) is caused by glucose 6-phosphatase deficiency. This enzyme is located in the liver and functions in gluconeogenesis to convert glucose-6-phosphate to glucose for its release into the blood. Impaired gluconeogenesis can lead to severe hypoglycemia during periods of fasting. It is characterized by excess glycogen in the liver, hepatomegaly, and fasting hypoglycemia.",

Giardiasis is usually acquired through the ingestion of cysts in contaminated water, which then mature into trophozoites in the small bowel. Parasitic overgrowth of the small bowel leads to the intestinal malabsorption of fats and carbohydrates. Giardiasis presents with persistent diarrhea that is foul-smelling and fatty, as well as abdominal pain, bloating, cramping, and weight loss. Children and infants are more likely than adults to present with dehydration and may experience failure to thrive as a result of malnutrition secondary to malabsorption. Diagnosis is made with stool culture, microscopy, or stool antigen testing. Light microscopy shows a flagellated, pear-shaped trophozoite with two large, central nuclei, and a medial axostyle.

Rickettsia infections (Choice C) include Rocky Mountain spotted fever and typhus. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is transmitted by a tick but presents with a vasculitic rash that affects the palms and soles. Typhus, on the other hand, starts with a generalized rash on the trunk that spreads outward and spares the palms and soles. Neither causes a singular, circular lesion.

Affected infants are able to conjugate bilirubin normally in the liver but are unable to excrete bile into the gastrointestinal lumen. Affected infants present with worsening jaundice caused by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, along with pale stool, dark urine, poor weight gain, and, in untreated cases, cirrhosis, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.

        "B": "Decreased hepatic glucuronosyltransferase activity underlies the pathogenesis of Gilbert syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome. Both of these diseases are characterized by defective hepatic conjugation of bilirubin. Accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin is identified by an increased serum concentration of indirect bilirubin. Decreased hepatic Y and Z protein concentrations (Choice C) would interfere with hepatic bilirubin conjugation. These two proteins are involved in the cytosolic binding of bilirubin in hepatocytes and allow for the transport of bilirubin to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum for metabolic processing. Decreased serum bilirubin uptake (Choice D) would occur in hypoalbuminemia. Circulating serum bilirubin is unconjugated and water insoluble. Normal transport of serum bilirubin to the liver is dependent upon normal concentrations of albumin, to which bilirubin is bound and thereby solubilized. Increased serum bilirubin production (Choice E) is suggestive of hemolytic disease, such as sickle cell disease. lntravascular hemolysis can be identified by increased serum concentrations of indirect, or unconjugated, bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, and decreased serum concentrations of haptoglobin."

The syndrome results from the effect of cytokines on the pulmonary parenchyma following direct or indirect lung injury. This results in endothelial injury with increased vascular permeability. Exudative fluid extends into the alveolar space, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. ARDS is characterized by respiratory failure with bilateral diffuse interstitial and airspace opacities from underlying diffuse alveolar damage and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Mechanical ventilation is often required in the management of ARDS as a result of hypoxemia and hypoventilation.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Cholinergic hyperactivity may result in cholinergic crisis as a result of excessive stimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. In the lungs, this results in decreased lung compliance, bronchoconstriction, and increased bronchial secretions. Potential causes include organophosphate toxicity and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor overdose. Enzymatic deficiency (Choice B) is characteristic of arantitrypsin deficiency, which results in host tissue damage from neutrophil elastase in the lungs and liver. Imaging typically shows emphysematous changes in the bilateral lung bases. Mucosal inflammation (Choice D) occurs with direct lung irritation or injury, as in pulmonary infection, chemical pneumonitis, inflammatory lung disease, foreign body aspiration, and malignancy. ARDS is characterized by increased vascular permeability in the alveoli rather than the mucosa. Oxygen toxicity (Choice E) is a complication of mechanical ventilation with high fraction of inspired oxygen. Exposure to high concentrations of oxygen can lead to cell membrane oxidative damage and collapse of alveoli, with extensive pulmonary edema and development of ARDS. This patient who was otherwise healthy prior to his infection without pulmonary involvement likely has a low fraction of inspired oxygen, and ARDS resulting from sepsis and increased vascular permeability is more likely than oxygen toxicity. Surfactant deficiency (Choice F) is the underlying pathophysiology of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome caused by alveolar collapse in inadequate surfactant production. Surfactant deficiency may also result from drowning injury or aspiration which dilutes the alveolar concentration of surfactant."

Pathologic murmurs are more frequently heard in infants under one year of age, caused by abnormalities such as valve disorders or shunt lesions, whereas murmurs heard after one year of age are more frequently benign, although they can be caused by valve stenosis, regurgitation, or atrial septal defects. Pathologic murmurs also present with related symptoms, such as dyspnea, diaphoresis, or failure to thrive. Further evaluation is recommended for murmurs that are grade 3 or greater in intensity, diastolic, at maximal intensity at the left upper sternal border, holosystolic, or have a harsh or blowing quality.

Other risk factors include lack of acclimatization, obesity, dehydration, and poor physical fitness. During exertion, the body is able to dissipate heat by increasing blood flow to skin and producing sweat to facilitate evaporative cooling. However, when ambient temperature is increased and humidity is high, these mechanisms are less effective at dissipating heat, resulting in heat exhaustion. Heat exhaustion is characterized by exercise intolerance, increased core body temperature, and the absence of neurologic disturbances (eg, altered mental status, confusion, or seizure). It is also associated with dehydration, tachycardia, lightheadedness, muscle cramps, and generalized weakness.

Increasing amounts of trapped air in the pleural space compresses the lung parenchyma, creating an inability for the lung to expand and causing it to collapse. As the pneumothorax progresses and continues to increase in size, it can result in tracheal or mediastinal deviation away from the affected hemithorax. It can also result in compression of the pulmonary veins and superior vena cava, decreasing venous return to the left and right atria, which manifests with hypotension, jugular venous distension, and obstructive shock. Tension pneumothorax is characterized by absent breath sounds and hyperresonance to percussion caused by increased air in the intrathoracic space displacing normal lung parenchyma. In an unstable patient, air from a tension pneumothorax should be evacuated by an emergent needle decompression followed by a tube thoracostomy.",

It antagonizes NMDA receptors leading to excitatory neurotransmitter release, inhibits reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, and stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors. Acute PCP intoxication can lead to psychosis, bizarre behavior, agitation, aggression, rotatory nystagmus, and ataxia. Patients may be diaphoretic, tachycardic, and hypertensive because of sympathomimetic effects. Chronic PCP use can lead to major depressive disorder, psychotic symptoms, memory loss, and dysarthria. Control of psychomotor agitation is the first step in management of patients with PCP intoxication for the safety of the patient and medical staff. Chemical sedation with benzodiazepines such as intramuscular lorazepam or midazolam can be administered to control symptoms. Once a patient is adequately sedated, further evaluation can be completed to assess for traumatic injuries or complications of PCP intoxication such as rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, hypertension, seizures, encephalopathy, or a comatose state.",

Type 1 diabetes mellitus can also be complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and patients can present with DKA as their initial manifestation. DKA can also result from increased insulin requirements during times of physiologic stress (eg, infection) or insulin nonadherence. DKA occurs as a result of the accumulation of serum ketones such as beta-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone in the setting of deficient insulin signaling. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs because of the relative state of starvation created through absent insulin signaling. Type 1 diabetes mellitus can also result in dehydration caused by hyperglycemia, glucosuria, and osmotic diuresis. This diuresis can result in dehydration, ketonuria, and orthostasis. Orthostatic vital signs are significant pulse increases greater than 20/min, systolic pressure decreases over 20 mm Hg, or diastolic pressure decreases over 10 mm Hg with changes in position from supine to seated to standing.

A) Celiac disease B) Diabetic ketoacidosis C) Inflammatory bowel disease D) Lactic acidosis E) Renal tubular acidosis Correct Answers: D. This infant presents with tachycardia, hypotension, delayed capillary refill, and acute-onset diarrhea consistent with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis with associated volume depletion. Children with gastroenteritis are at increased risk for volume depletion in comparison to adults. Clinical signs of volume depletion include tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, and prolonged capillary refill. Children may present with irritability or lethargy. Laboratory studies show perturbations in serum sodium and potassium concentrations. Volume depletion secondary to diarrhea is usually accompanied by a significant stool loss of bicarbonate, which, in combination with the hypoperfusion of end organs with lactic acidosis, may result in metabolic acidosis. Urinalysis shows aciduria and an increased urinary specific gravity. Treatment includes the repletion of fluids and electrolytes. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Celiac disease (Choice A), or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, presents with diarrhea and malabsorption caused by gliadin hypersensitivity. It does not present with an acute onset and rarely leads to significant volume depletion. Diabetic ketoacidosis (Choice B) may present with volume depletion and metabolic acidosis. However, in an infant this is most commonly caused by type 1 diabetes mellitus, which presents with polyuria and glucosuria. This child's history of acute onset diarrhea and a sick contact are more suggestive of gastroenteritis. Poor feeding in an acutely ill child may lead to starvation ketoacidosis with mild ketonuria. Inflammatory bowel disease (Choice C) presents with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. It is rare in infancy. Renal tubular acidosis (Choice E) is a family of disorders that causes metabolic acidosis. While renal tubular acidosis may present with metabolic acidosis, aciduria, and electrolyte disturbances, it does not typically present with acute onset diarrhea."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient's most likely diagnosis is constitutional growth delay, which is a normal variant of growth. Short stature has a variety of causes, such as constitutional growth delay, familial (hereditary) short stature, chronic steroid use, endocrine abnormalities (eg, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), cardiopulmonary disease, and genetic disorders (eg, Down syndrome, Turner syndrome). Familial short stature and constitutional growth delay are the most common causes of short stature. Familial short stature is associated with short stature in both parents, a normal gain of height velocity, and a bone age that corresponds with chronological age, whereas a constitutional growth delay is independent of parental stature, has a consistently decreased growth velocity, and has a bone age younger than chronological age. Patients with constitutional growth delay may experience a delayed onset of puberty. These patients typically reach a normal adult height, with more rapid increases in height gain velocity as they progress through puberty. This patient has parents with normal stature and a decreased growth velocity, leading to a height that is consistently in the 3rd percentile. He does not have other signs or symptoms to suggest a pathologic cause of short stature, making constitutional growth delay the most likely diagnosis.",

        "A": "Adrenal insufficiency typically presents with fatigue, nausea, fasting hypoglycemia, muscle weakness, and morning headache caused by glucocorticoid insufficiency. Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency may also demonstrate mineralocorticoid and androgen deficiency, which would present with urinary salt wasting and decreased body hair, respectively. This patient does not demonstrate the symptoms or physical examination signs of adrenal insufficiency. Familial short stature (Choice C) typically presents in young patients whose parents are both of short stature with a normal growth velocity and bone age consistent with chronological age. These patients will remain of short stature into adulthood. This patient has parents with normal stature, making this answer less likely. Growth hormone deficiency (Choice D) is a rare condition that can present in infancy or childhood depending on the severity of deficiency. Acquired growth hormone deficiency is typically caused by a non-functional pituitary tumor and presents with severe growth delay and a bone age younger than chronological age. It is associated with a rapid decline in the height-for-age curve, crossing percentiles. This patient's growth velocity has been slow but consistent, making growth hormone deficiency a less likely cause of his short stature. Insufficient caloric intake (Choice E) typically results in an abnormally low weight along with signs of malnutrition such as dry skin and hair loss (caused by decreased protein stores). This patient has a normal weight and lacks physical examination signs of malnutrition."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a defect in adrenal steroid biosynthesis, particularly of cortisol, with variable effects on mineralocorticoids and androgens. Because of decreased production of hormones, the adrenal gland is stimulated by the pituitary in an attempt to increase hormone production, leading to adrenal hyperplasia, the namesake of this condition. The most common form of CAH and the cause of this patient's manifestations is 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase deficiency presents with salt wasting in a newborn or precocious puberty in a child, as well as virilization of infants with an XX karyotype (eg, clitoral hypertrophy, labial fusion), caused by increased concentrations of androgens. Because of the enzyme deficiency, concentrations of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone are increased, while aldosterone and cortisol are decreased, leading to hypotension, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (caused by inadequate cortisol). Diffuse hyperpigmentation of the skin, as seen in this newborn, is characteristic. Melanin production is regulated in part by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). MSH is a byproduct of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) which also produces adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In adrenal insufficiency, stimulation of ACTH production by POMC simultaneously produces MSH, leading to diffuse hyperpigmentation in affected patients. Treatment of CAH consists of exogenous glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid supplementation.",

Pertussis classically presents in three stages. The catarrhal stage is first, which presents with fever, rhinorrhea, and a mild cough. This progresses to the paroxysmal stage after 1 to 2 weeks, in which patients experience violent bouts of extreme coughing, at times violent enough to cause secondary traumatic injury such as rib fractures, urinary incontinence, pneumothorax, and facial petechiae. Often, such coughing fits are accompanied by cyanosis and may be followed by syncope, emesis, or apnea. The paroxysmal stage can last for weeks to months. Symptoms resolve during the convalescent stage, which lasts from 1 to 4 weeks. Pertussis can be prevented with immunization in the form of acellular pertussis, typically administered along with tetanus and diphtheria vaccines (DTaP). It can be transmitted in respiratory droplets, thus all individuals who come into contact with infected patients should wear a mask and eye protection.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a Gram-negative diplococcus and can cause vaginitis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Vaginitis typically presents with mucopurulent discharge and pruritus. Cervicitis presents with similar discharge, but also with an erythematous, friable cervix and cervical motion tenderness on examination. When infection spreads to the fallopian tubes and ovaries, PID with purulent cervical discharge, uterine and adnexal tenderness, and systemic symptoms such as fever can result. If left untreated, PID can become complicated by a tuba-ovarian abscess or intraabdominal abscess, presenting with focal tenderness and a fluctuant mass; it can cause consequent infertility. Gonorrhea can present with dissemination (tenosynovitis, dermatitis, polyarthralgia) or reactive arthritis. Risk factors for the development of gonorrhea include multiple sexual partners, new sexual partners, receptive anal intercourse, a young age, substance abuse, and inconsistent condom usage. Coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis is common, therefore treatment typically consists of ceftriaxone and doxycycline, with the latter covering a possible concurrent chlamydia! infection while confirmatory tests are pending.

Oral azithromycin and intramuscular penicillin therapy (Choice D) would cover a chlamydia! infection but would not cover gonorrhea, as N. gonorrhoeae has become increasingly resistant to penicillin. Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline would provide better coverage. No treatment indicated because the patient is asymptomatic (Choice E) is inappropriate, as failure to diagnose and treat this patient could lead to a multitude of complications, such as reactive arthritis, disseminated gonococcal infection, and pelvic inflammatory disease with consequent infertility.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Testicular torsion occurs when the testicle rotates about itself within the scrotal sac, resulting in vascular congestion and potential cessation of venous or arterial flow to the testis. Patients typically present with acute, severe testicular pain with diffuse tenderness and swelling and an absent cremasteric reflex. In contrast, patients with torsion of the appendix testis present with groin pain, a nontender testicle, a tender, palpable localized mass adjacent to one pole of the testicle, and an intact cremasteric reflex. The appendix testis is a vestigial structure, typically on the anterior and superior aspect of the testis and has a pedunculated shape that may predispose it to torsion. When torsed, the appendix testis may appear as a small blue or black mass in the scrotum. The diagnosis may be made clinically, or with ultrasound in cases where testicular torsion cannot be excluded. While patients with testicular torsion require surgical detorsion and orchiopexy to prevent infertility, management of torsion of the appendix testis is generally supportive, with analgesics and scrotal support.",

Patients with epididymitis may have moderate pain relief with elevation of the testis. Incarcerated hernia (Choice B) refers to the contents of a hernia becoming trapped in the hernia defect, unable to be reduced to native position. If this type of hernia contains bowel, an obstruction can result. An inguinal hernia can become incarcerated, but this would typically present with severe tenderness and a larger mass with swelling in the inguinal area.",

Especially when it occurs after puberty, it is a risk factor for infertility. Testicular hematoma (Choice D) can occur in blunt scrotal trauma and presents with testicular swelling, warmth, and pain.

Rheumatic fever is a sequela of untreated group A Streptococcus infection, commonly pharyngitis, in which there is a type II hypersensitivity reaction to self-antigens having a similar structure to, and thus molecularly mimicking streptococcal M protein. Diagnosis is made by the Jones criteria, which describe many of the core clinical features of rheumatic fever. The major criteria include polyarthritis, carditis, subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum, and Sydenham chorea; the minor criteria include fever, leukocytosis, arthralgia, and PR interval prolongation. Patients often have an increased antistreptolysin O titer. Biopsy of affected cardiac tissue discloses a granulomatous reaction with presence of Aschoff bodies. Complications of rheumatic fever include mitral valve inflammation leading to long-term sequelae of chronic mitral valve regurgitation, prolapse, or stenosis. Treatment of the initial streptococcal infection is effective for reducing the risk for developing rheumatic fever.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The recommended schedule of hepatitis B immunization and immunoprophylaxis in newborns is dependent on the maternal HBsAg status. HBsAg assay is an important component of prenatal care and is typically checked at the first prenatal visit. If HBsAg is positive or if there are signs of active maternal hepatitis B infection, the newborn should receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) intramuscularly and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) as early as possible, with additional doses of HBV at 2 and 6 months of age. In a HBsAg negative mother, only HBV is needed and doses are given at birth, 2 months, and 6 months. As in this case, if the mother's HBsAg status is unknown but there is no evidence of active infection, the newborn should receive HBV within 12 hours and HBIG can be delayed until the maternal serologies have returned. If the serology returns positive for HBsAg, the infant should receive HBIG within 1 week. If the serology returns negative for HBsAg, the newborn does not require HBIG.

A) Chronic renal failure B Diabetes insiP.idus C) Diabetes mellitus D) Inappropriate secretion of ADH (vasopressin) E) Psychogenic polydipsia F) Urinary tract infection Correct Answer: B. Central diabetes insipidus may result from head trauma and is characterized by the inadequate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also known as vasopressin) from the posterior pituitary. ADH binds V 2 receptors of the late distal convoluted tubule and the collecting tubule principal cells, which results in the insertion of aquaporin channels in the luminal surface. This results in increased free water absorption and maintains tight regulation of serum osmolality. Inadequate production of ADH by the posterior pituitary gland may occur in various pathologies, such as pituitary tumors, trauma, tuberculosis, or intracranial surgery. This results in a decreased concentration of aquaporin channels inserted within the principal cells of the collecting tubule, leading to an inability to absorb adequate amounts of free water, which causes dilute urine, decreased urine osmolality, hypernatremia, and increased serum osmolality. The hypothalamic osmoreceptors detect this increased serum osmolality, which causes the patient to report extreme thirst. Patients typically also present with production of large volumes of dilute urine, dehydration, and altered mental status. Treatment is with desmopressin, an analog of vasopressin, which results in recovery of free water via aquaporin insertion in the collecting tubule. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, E, and F.

It would be unlikely in this patient with normal creatinine and no history of kidney impairment. Diabetes mellitus (Choice C) can occur in children because of autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet cells, leading to impaired insulin production and hyperglycemia. In this patient with normal glucose concentrations and imbalanced serum and urine osmolality, central diabetes insipidus is more likely. Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (vasopressin) (Choice D) can occur secondary to head trauma, but involves excess ADH production, which leads to euvolemic hyponatremia. Psychogenic polydipsia (Choice E) refers to excess intake of free water. Excess free water consumption dilutes urea and sodium which are lost in diuresis; the resultant lack of concentration of sodium and urea within the renal interstitium results in loss of ability to concentrate urine. This results in hyponatremia, decreased serum osmolality, and decreased urine osmolality. Urinary tract infection (Choice F) can present with dysuria, urinary frequency, foul-smelling urine, suprapubic discomfort, and fever. In pediatric patients, it can also cause nocturia, but this patient does not have any other signs of a urinary tract infection. It would not cause hypernatremia and increased serum osmolality. Educational Objective: Central diabetes insipidus may result from head trauma and is characterized by the inadequate secretion of ADH from the posterior pituitary. Patients typically present with large volumes of dilute urine, dehydration, thirst, and increased serum osmolality. r \" , r-- r ,",

Atrial fibrillation also occurs more often in patients with structural heart disease, and supraventricular tachycardia is more likely in a previously healthy patient with regular tachycardia. Long QT interval syndrome (Choice B) is a disorder of prolonged ventricular depolarization and repolarization. It appears on ECG with a prolonged QT interval. It can be complicated by polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or torsades de pointes. Sinus tachycardia (Choice C) would be unlikely to have a pulse of 260/min. The maximal pulse from the sinus node is typically lower than 220/min and on ECG, there are P waves prior to every QRS complex. Pulse resulting from supraventricular tachycardia can be higher because of a reentrant rhythm that bypasses the atrioventricular node. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) (Choice E) shows a wide QRS complex tachycardia on ECG. VT occurs when an abnormal electrical focus or a reentry circuit causes rapid contraction of the ventricles. There are many criteria for defining VT on the rhythm strip, but the general morphology will show wide QRS complex tachycardia. There are monomorphic and polymorphic forms of VT.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This child presents with leukocoria (a white pupillary reflex) and a sensory exotropia, which is suggestive of retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is a malignant proliferation of retinal neuroendocrine cells and is the most common ophthalmic malignancy in children. Retinoblastoma results from inactivating mutations of both copies of the RB1 gene, which functions as a tumor suppressor by halting cell cycle progression at the G1 checkpoint. RB1 mutations may be either acquired or inherited. In cases of germline RB1 mutation, a single mutated allele is inherited, and the second allele acquires a subsequent mutation during development. Infants who carry germline mutations are more likely to have bilateral retinoblastoma with multiple foci of tumors in the eye, whereas infants with two acquired mutations are more likely to have unilateral retinoblastoma. Ultrasound of the eye is helpful for defining the size of the lesion and for detecting characteristic intralesional calcifications. Within the eye, large tumor size, tumor seeding of the vitreous humor, and involvement of the iris or anterior chamber are associated with a worse prognosis. If undetected, retinoblastoma may invade the optic nerve, leading to a greater risk for metastasis to the brain. Most cases of retinoblastoma may be successfully managed with chemotherapy, although advanced cases may require enucleation with special attention paid to achieving negative margins at the optic nerve, as cases that have undergone metastasis have a poor prognosis.",

        "A": "Acquired exotropia may result from visual sensory deprivation in a non-seeing eye. However, exotropia will not cause leukocoria. Chronic endophthalmitis (Choice B) typically results from hematogenous spread of bacteria or fungus or following ocular surgery. This infant is not ill appearing and lacks a history suggestive of a likely cause of endophthalmitis. Eyes affected by endophthalmitis are often painful and have conjunctiva! injection. Congenital glaucoma (Choice C) presents with characteristic findings including buphthalmos (an enlarged eye), a large cornea, which may be edematous and opacified, and increased intraocular pressure. Infants typically present with epiphora, photophobia, and blepharospasm or eye rubbing. Congenital glaucoma does not cause leukocoria. Familial cataract (Choice D) may be either unilateral or bilateral and may be associated with chromosomal abnormalities or inherited mutations in a variety of genes. Congenital cataracts are present at birth. This child has developed a wandering eye after normal development for the first several months of life, which is more consistent with a diagnosis of retinoblastoma."

        "A": "Cellulitis presents with cutaneous pain, erythema, and induration spreading outward from a source of infection, often an initial abrasion or injection. The numerous papules and small plaques seen in this case are characteristic of guttate psoriasis, not cellulitis. However, a streptococcal cellulitis could potentially trigger guttate psoriasis. Nummular eczema (Choice B) is a term used to describe eczematous patches which are round or coin shaped. Like other forms of eczema, or dermatitis, the rash is initially characterized by erythematous papules and vesicles with exudates and crusting. With chronic scratching, the affected areas become dry, scaly, and excoriated in a process called lichenification. Pityriasis rosea (Choice C) is a cutaneous eruption characterized by the acute onset of a pruritic patch, which is followed by the development of numerous smaller macules and patches. It commonly involves the trunk and proximal extremities. It is usually induced by a viral infection including human herpesvirus 6 and 7, though often the exact infection is not determined. In this case, a pruritic patch was not seen making guttate psoriasis more likely than pityriasis rosea. Tinea corporis (Choice E) is caused by a superficial dermatophyte infection of the skin, most often Trichophyton tonsurans. The classic appearance is a round, annular patch with a scaly border. Potassium hydroxide preparation will show hyphae. Numerous small papules and plaques are not typically seen."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Wheezing that does not improve with nebulized albuterol, hyperinflation of the right lung, and acute onset of difficulty breathing and cough raises suspicion for foreign body aspiration. Foreign body aspiration can cause obstruction of the airway, leading to impaired oxygenation and ventilation. Children from 1 to 3 years old are at increased risk for foreign body aspiration because of their ability to stand and mobilize independently, ability to grasp and put small objects into their mouths, and an immature swallowing mechanism. Foreign bodies can be located anywhere in the airway between the larynx and the bronchi. Children can present with severe respiratory distress, cyanosis, and stridor, or may have a less severe presentation with partial airway obstruction, presenting with cough, tachypnea, decreased air entry on auscultation, or wheezing. Chest x-ray can show hyperinflation of one lung, which is caused by air trapping and partial airway obstruction in which air is able to pass via inspiration, but not exhalation. Foreign bodies are typically in the right lung because of the more vertical anatomic position of the right main bronchus. Management of foreign body aspiration involves flexible or rigid bronchoscopy to remove the object. Object removal is necessary and retained foreign bodies can be complicated by airway inflammation and infection.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Chest percussion and physiotherapy can be beneficial for patients with mucus plugging of small airways, such as in cystic fibrosis. Chest percussion can help dislodge mucus and improve its clearance by coughing. Oral administration of amoxicillin (Choice B) would be indicated if the patient presented with a bacterial illness, such as pneumonia, streptococcal pharyngitis, or acute otitis media. Patients with pneumonia can also present with cough, however it is typically a subacute onset and a chest x-ray would show localized infiltrate or opacification in an area of the lung. Oral administration of corticosteroids (Choice C) would be helpful in a patient with moderate to severe acute asthma exacerbation along with nebulized albuterol. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation of airways and have been shown to decrease hospitalizations for asthma. This patient's wheezing did not improve with nebulized albuterol, making acute asthma exacerbation less likely. Subcutaneous administration of epinephrine (Choice D) would not be indicated in this patient. Intramuscular epinephrine is used in the emergent treatment of anaphylaxis, which can be characterized by urticaria, vomiting, diarrhea, wheezing, stridor, oropharyngeal swelling, and airway obstruction. However, this patient's wheezing is more likely caused by foreign body aspiration and the patient has no other signs of anaphylaxis. Furthermore, intramuscular epinephrine is preferred over subcutaneous administration because of its more rapid and reliable onset."

The classic presentation includes slow onset of hip pain which is worsened by activity and associated with a limp. The pain may or may not be relieved with rest. X-rays often show no abnormalities. However, bone scan characteristically shows decreased perfusion of the femoral head, as in this case. MRI may also be considered for diagnosis and will show bone marrow changes. Treatments include preventing weight-bearing on the affected leg and, occasionally, may require operative intervention or hip arthroplasty. Inadequate treatment results in fragmentation and subsequent deformity of the femoral head.",

        "A": "Ankylosing spondylitis is a rheumatologic inflammatory condition involving the vertebrae that presents with subacute to chronic back pain and limited range of motion that is improved with exercise. The resultant arthropathy can result in frequent falls and fractures, however without back pain or any systemic inflammatory manifestations, it would be an unlikely diagnosis in this case. Pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (Choice C), also called oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, is most common in girls aged 2 to 3 years. It presents with swelling of a single joint, often the knee, with accompanied limping but no pain. On examination, the involved joints are swollen and tender without erythema. Unlike other forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic manifestations are characteristically absent. Septic arthritis (Choice D) results from bacterial infection of the synovial joint space, most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus. The affected joint demonstrates pain, swelling, and erythema. Arthrocentesis is indicated for the evaluation of monoarticular erythema and swelling to evaluate for septic arthritis, which characteristically shows purulent synovial fluid with greater than 50,000 leukocytes per mm"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Meningitis in infants is commonly caused by bacteria and can present with fever or hypothermia, lethargy, irritability, altered mental status, a bulging fontanelle, poor feeding, and seizures. Diagnosis of meningitis typically involves lumbar puncture, and evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid will show an increased white blood cell count with predominant neutrophils, increased protein, and decreased glucose. Thorough evaluation also includes a complete blood count, blood culture, and urine culture to evaluate for other causes of sepsis, as well as culture of the cerebrospinal fluid to determine the causative organism. This patient has signs of sepsis, a systemic inflammatory syndrome that may occur in response to infection. Sepsis can be complicated by shock and multiorgan failure with a high mortality rate. Septic shock is characterized by vasoplegia (impaired response of the vasculature to vasoconstricting stimuli) with markedly decreased systemic vascular resistance, tachycardia, increased cardiac output, oliguria, and lactic acidosis. The initial step for management in septic shock involves emergency antibiotics and fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids, such as 0.9% saline. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Administration of dopamine (Choice A) or epinephrine (Choice B) may be indicated in this patient if the patient continues to be hypotensive after a trial of fluid resuscitation. Fluid administration should be the initial step for resuscitation of septic shock. Administration of sodium bicarbonate (Choice D) would be unlikely to be beneficial in this patient, as this patient's pH is normal. Administration of sodium bicarbonate may be helpful in patients who are acidotic. Endotracheal intubation (Choice E) would not be emergently indicated in this patient as the patient is breathing, ventilating, and oxygenating well as shown on arterial blood gas analysis.

Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (Choice E) results in hemolysis upon exposure to certain medications such as sulfa drugs and oxidants. It does not cause marked leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Hereditary spherocytosis (Choice F) is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in ankyrin, spectrin, and band erythrocyte membrane proteins that lead to a loss of the normal connection between the inner membrane skeleton and the outer lipid bilayer. Clinical symptoms can include jaundice, splenomegaly, and anemia. Peripheral smear shows spherocytes. Sickle cell disease (Choice G) is caused by mutations in both ~-globin alleles that result in an abnormal hemoglobin S, which polymerizes in hypoxia and causes sickling of erythrocytes. Patients have anemia and sickle forms on peripheral blood smear. Sickle cell trait (Choice H) is caused by a mutation in one ~-globin allele. It infrequently causes symptoms associated with sickle cell disease such as severe anemia and acute pain crisis. Anemia, if present, is mild. Other cell lines show no abnormalities. Thalassemia minor (Choice I) can occur as a result of mutations or deletions in one of the ~-globin alleles or in one or more of the a-globin alleles, leading to impaired production of hemoglobin A. Patients have a mild microcytic anemia and normal concentrations of leukocytes and platelets. Hemoglobin electrophoresis can distinguish between these two entities."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "lnduration exceeding 15 mm is considered a positive result for a PPD skin test and is suggestive of latent tuberculosis infection in this patient. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a slow-growing mycobacterial organism transmitted via respiratory secretions. It presents with primary, latent, and reactivation patterns. In primary disease, patients present with subacute fevers, weight loss, night sweats, cough, and malaise. Latent tuberculosis can occur as the organism proliferates within macrophages and is maintained within caseating granulomas. PPD skin testing stimulates a T-lymphocyte driven type IV hypersensitivity reaction against subdermal tuberculin antigen. Causes of false positive PPD testing include prior vaccination with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine. This patient's positive test result likely represents a true positive. Her most significant risk factor for tuberculosis is volunteering in a skilled nursing care facility, as tuberculosis is more common and spreads more easily in crowded populations, such as in nursing facilities and prisons . Latent tuberculosis is treated with a prolonged course of isoniazid or rifampin.",

        "A": "While overseas travel to endemic areas is a significant risk factor for tuberculosis, Ireland and western Europe are not endemic areas for tuberculosis. Endemic regions for tuberculosis include sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and eastern and southeastern Asia. Participation in high school events (Choice B) is not a significant risk factor for tuberculosis. Prolonged conditions of crowding, as in a prison, are a more significant risk factor for tuberculosis than single large events, which do not confer significant risk in non-endemic areas. Raising livestock (Choice C) confers increased risk for acquiring particular infectious organisms, such as Bacillus anthracis, Coxiel/a burnetii, and Francisel/a tularensis. M. tuberculosis is not a zoonotic organism and is spread by human-to-human contact. Sexual activity (Choice D) does not confer an increased risk for acquiring tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis is not a sexually transmitted organism and is spread by respiratory secretions. Smoking marijuana (Choice E) does not confer an increased risk for acquiring tuberculosis. While chronic pulmonary disease, such as silicosis, does confer an increased risk for tuberculosis, this is unlikely in a teenage patient with occasional marijuana use."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "HIV infection, acquired via vertical transmission from the patient's mother, is the most likely cause of the patient's recurrent pneumococcal pneumonia, otitis media, and herpes zoster infection with axillary lymphadenopathy. HIV transmission may occur at any time during gestation but is most commonly acquired at or around the time of delivery and in the immediate postpartum period during breastfeeding. Transmission is uncommon if the mother is taking antiretroviral therapy and has a decreased HIV viral load. As a result of screening for HIV in most developed countries, the incidence of perinatal and pediatric HIV infection has decreased, although this is not true around the world. While many pediatric patients with perinatally acquired HIV infection will manifest symptoms within the first few months to years, it has been recognized that a subpopulation of patients will not develop symptoms or AIDS-defining conditions until many years later, as in this case. Symptoms in children are non-specific, and AIDS-defining conditions in children younger than six vary slightly from those in older children and adults. Clues to the diagnosis in this case include the presence of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in the patient's mother, which is an AIDS-defining illness and should prompt evaluation for HIV infection in this patient.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Chronic granulomatous disease is caused by NADPH oxidase deficiency and results in impaired intracellular killing of catalase positive pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae is catalase negative. Patients present with recurrent pyogenic infections with organisms such as S. aureus. Hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome (Choice C) is caused by mutations in the JAK-STAT signaling cascade, which impairs the development and function of T helper 17 (Th n) cells. Th cells secrete interleukin-17 17 (IL-17), a potent neutrophil chemotaxis agent, so deficiency results in poor neutrophil migration to sites of infection. Patients have recurrent skin infections but with non-inflamed abscesses (cold abscess) and diffuse atopic dermatitis. Thymic-parathyroid dysplasia (DiGeorge syndrome) (Choice D) is caused by a 22q11 deletion that leads to failure of the third and fourth branchial pouches to develop. These structures give rise to the thymus and parathyroid glands, and their absence leads to thymic aplasia and hypocalcemia in cardiac and craniofacial defects. Patients are susceptible to viral and fungal infections. a X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Choice E) occurs as result of mutations in the BTK gene that encodes a tyrosine kinase essential for all stages of B-lymphocyte development and proliferation. Patients lack functioning B lymphocytes, and therefore, lack normal concentrations of immunoglobulins. It nearly always presents within the first eighteen months of life with recurrent infections. It is more common in male patients given X-linked inheritance."

Motor vehicle collisions, falls, and sports injuries are common causes of this type of injury. A rapid deceleration injury, such as caused by a fall, can cause the kidney to be crushed against the paravertebral muscles, avulsed from the ureteropelvic junction or the renal vessels, or thrombosed. In any of these cases, blood supply to the kidney is interrupted. Flank tenderness, flank bruising, or lower rib fractures should all raise concern for blunt kidney injury. Hematuria is a common presenting symptom seen in over two-thirds of patients with blunt renal injury. It should be investigated quickly with measurement of urine blood as part of the initial trauma assessment, as intravenous fluid administration can dilute hematuria and preclude detection.",

Pertussis classically presents in three stages. The catarrhal stage is first, which presents with fever, rhinorrhea, and a mild cough. This progresses to the paroxysmal stage after 1 to 2 weeks, in which patients experience violent bouts of extreme coughing, at times violent enough to cause secondary traumatic injury such as rib fractures, urinary incontinence, pneumothorax, and facial petechiae. Often, such coughing fits are accompanied by cyanosis and may be followed by syncope, emesis, or apnea. The paroxysmal stage can last for weeks to months. Symptoms resolve during the convalescent stage, which lasts from 1 to 4 weeks. Pertussis can be prevented with immunization in the form of acellular pertussis, typically administered along with tetanus and diphtheria vaccines (DTaP). It can be transmitted in respiratory droplets, thus all individuals who come into contact with infected patients should wear a mask and eye protection.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Antiviral therapy for all health care workers can be given with oseltamivir in an influenza outbreak, but 8. pertussis is a bacterial infection and would not be treated with an antiviral medication. Contact isolation (Choice B) is reserved for pathogens such as C/ostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and others that are easily transmitted through contact with the skin. These precautions involve the wearing of disposable gloves and gowns. Erythromycin therapy for all healthcare workers (Choice D) could be considered in instances of a 8. pertussis outbreak, which can occur if the index case is not recognized or droplet precautions are not instituted but is not necessary in this case. Intravenous immune globulin therapy for all health care workers (Choice E) is not used for post-exposure prophylaxis for 8. pertussis. Intravenous immune globulin therapy for patients (Choice F) is occasionally given after exposure to certain pathogens. For example, those exposed to rabies are given both rabies immune globulin and a rabies vaccine. Pertussis vaccination for all healthcare workers (Choice G) is not correct. While all adults should receive the tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) every 10 years, infection can occur even in patients who have recently been vaccinated. The best method of preventing infection is the use of droplet precautions. Pertussis vaccination for the patient (Choice H) will not change her disease course, although vaccination is still recommended at 4 months, 6 months, 15 months, and at age 4. No intervention (Choice I) is not appropriate as failure to contain this infection could lead to exposure of many other patients and staff."

Femoral fractures are a common long bone fracture in children, with peaks of incidence in toddlers because of accidental trauma and adolescents because of motor vehicle collisions. A femoral shaft fracture may be complicated by shortening of the muscles of the knee and hip which causes the fractured femur to displace, so early recognition and intervention is needed to prevent permanent limb length discrepancy. Clinically, most femoral shaft fractures will demonstrate obvious deformity, swelling, shortening, or crepitus on examination. A neurovascular examination distal to the site of swelling should be performed to ensure that the fracture has not caused damage to nerves or arteries. The next step in management of a suspected femoral fracture is radiographic assessment using standard anterior-posterior and lateral plain x-rays of the affected area and the joints above and below the suspected fracture. This ensures correct diagnosis and assists in management planning.",

Range of motion exercises (Choice D) may be needed following complete healing of the femoral fracture, but if performed now without adequate treatment, they would likely worsen the fracture. Immobilization is an important step in treatment of a femoral fracture. Acetaminophen therapy (Choice E) may be used for mild musculoskeletal complaints and is safe for use in children.

It requires two of the following for diagnosis: oligo- or anovulation, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, and clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism (eg, hirsutism, acne). It is also associated with signs of insulin resistance, such as acanthosis nigricans and increased blood glucose concentrations. PCOS is caused by an abnormal hypothalamic hormonal feedback response, that is caused by a primary functional ovarian hyperandrogenism (increased androgens produced by the theca lutein cells), which leads to increased luteinizing hormone (LH) in comparison to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Treatment includes weight loss, combined oral contraceptives for menstrual regulation, and spironolactone or ketoconazole for hirsutism. Clomiphene stimulates increased ovulation and can also be utilized for individuals desiring pregnancy as can metformin. If the patient is diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, oral antihyperglycemic medications or insulin may also be necessary.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient's most likely diagnosis is constitutional growth delay, which is a normal variant of growth. Short stature has a variety of causes, such as constitutional growth delay, familial (hereditary) short stature, chronic steroid use, endocrine abnormalities (eg, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), cardiopulmonary disease, and genetic disorders (eg, Down syndrome, Turner syndrome). Familial short stature and constitutional growth delay are the most common causes of short stature. Familial short stature is associated with short stature in both parents, a normal gain of height velocity, and a bone age that corresponds with chronological age, whereas a constitutional growth delay is independent of parental stature, has a consistently decreased growth velocity, and has a bone age younger than chronological age. Patients with constitutional growth delay may experience a delayed onset of puberty. These patients typically reach a normal adult height, with more rapid increases in height gain velocity as they progress through puberty. This patient has parents with normal stature and a decreased growth velocity, leading to a height that is consistently in the 3rd percentile. He does not have other signs or symptoms to suggest a pathologic cause of short stature, making constitutional growth delay the most likely diagnosis.",

This patient does not demonstrate the symptoms or physical examination signs of adrenal insufficiency. Familial short stature (Choice C) typically presents in young patients whose parents are both of short stature with a normal growth velocity and bone age consistent with chronological age. These patients will remain of short stature into adulthood. This patient has parents with normal stature, making this answer less likely. Growth hormone deficiency (Choice D) is a rare condition that can present in infancy or childhood depending on the severity of deficiency. Acquired growth hormone deficiency is typically caused by a non-functional pituitary tumor and presents with severe growth delay and a bone age younger than chronological age. It is associated with a rapid decline in the height-for-age curve, crossing percentiles. This patient's growth velocity has been slow but consistent, making growth hormone deficiency a less likely cause of his short stature. Insufficient caloric intake (Choice E) typically results in an abnormally low weight along with signs of malnutrition such as dry skin and hair loss (caused by decreased protein stores). This patient has a normal weight and lacks physical examination signs of malnutrition."

Normal fetal circulation is unique in that oxygenated blood arrives from the maternal circulation via the umbilical vein and reaches the inferior vena cava. From there, oxygenated blood is shunted from the right atrium to the left atrium, left ventricle {LV), and systemic circulation. The fetal lungs are filled with amniotic fluid while in utero, so the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is high. In patients with a VSD, increased PVR effectively prevents left-to-right shunting of blood from the LV to the right ventricle (RV). At birth, amniotic fluid is cleared and expelled from the lungs and the PVR decreases dramatically, followed by a gradual decrease in PVR over the next several weeks. As the PVR decreases, the pressure gradient between the LV and the RV increases such that blood is shunted from the LV to the RV with each cardiac cycle. This change in PVR explains the change in the patient's murmur.",

Often, such coughing fits are accompanied by cyanosis and may be followed by syncope, emesis, or apnea. The paroxysmal stage can last for weeks to months. Symptoms resolve during the convalescent stage, which lasts from one to four weeks. Pertussis toxin causes impaired recruitment and migration of phagocytes and production of inflammatory mediators. Patients often have significant lymphocytosis. Pertussis can be prevented with immunization in the form of acellular pertussis, typically administered along with tetanus and diphtheria vaccines.

Signs and symptoms during this stage include fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, hyporeflexia, myxedema, and dry, cool skin. Fine needle biopsy demonstrates lymphoid infiltrate with the presence of follicles and Hiirthle cells. Treatment is with oral replacement of thyroid hormone.",

Commonly implicated organisms include Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Endemic goiter (Choice C) is caused by dietary iodine deficiency. It is rare in developed countries because of the routine fortification of common food staples, such as salt, with iodine. Graves disease (Choice D) is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents, as well as in adults, and it is caused by an autoantibody that activates thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors on the thyroid. It presents with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, pretibial myxedema, and thyroid ophthalmopathy, which can cause diplopia, proptosis, and restrictive strabismus. Serum concentrations of TSH are typically reduced and antithyroid peroxidase antibodies would not be present. Thyroid carcinoma (Choice E) is typically non-functional and does not secrete thyroid hormone. Papillary thyroid carcinoma is encountered most frequently."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Left ventricular volume overload as a result of aortic insufficiency (Al) explains this patient's widened pulse pressure, blowing diastolic murmur, and bounding radial pulses in addition to his exertional symptoms. The causes of Al, also called aortic regurgitation, include bicuspid aortic valve, aortic root dilation, and a history of rheumatic heart disease. It is also commonly associated with syndromes such as Marfan and Turner syndrome. Al results from an incompetent aortic valve that allows retrograde blood flow from the aortic root to the left ventricle (LV) during diastole. This results in an increased LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) as both blood from the aorta and the left atrium fill the LV. Increased volume stretches the compliant ventricle thereby increasing myocardial contractility, which is reflected as an increased stroke volume (SV) and a comparatively increased cardiac output. Over time, eccentric hypertrophy of the LV leads to loss of normal compliance and progressive LV systolic dysfunction.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "is not a feature of isolated Al. Increased PVR occurs in conditions such as pulmonary hypertension or pulmonic stenosis. Eventually, left-sided heart failure can lead to increased PVR, but this occurs over time and the patient in this case shows no symptoms of pulmonary hypertension or cor pulmonale. Increased systemic cardiac output (Choice B) is incorrect. In compensated Al, the cardiac output is maintained, but over time the progressive hypertrophy of the LV in combination with ongoing aortic regurgitation leads to systolic dysfunction and decreased cardiac output. Increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (Choice C) is incorrect. SVR tends to be relatively normal in individuals with chronic compensated Al, although they tend to have a greater disparity between systolic and diastolic pressures. The large volume ejected during systole transiently increases the systolic pressure while the regurgitant volume back into the LV leads to a lower than expected diastolic pressure. Left ventricular pressure overload (Choice D) is incorrect. In young patients with chronic Al and no evidence of heart failure, the LV is able to compensate for increased end-diastolic volume by distending, thereby maintaining a normal LV end-diastolic pressure. Over time, however, eccentric hypertrophy can cause diastolic dysfunction and increased LV pressure."

Poor weight gain is a common diagnosis seen in primary care offices in approximately 5% of pediatric patients. Risk factors include prematurity, developmental delay, congenital abnormalities, or any condition resulting in inadequate intake, absorption, or metabolism of nutrients. Poverty, social isolation, certain nutritional beliefs and practices, poor parenting skills, substance abuse, violence, or other abuse also predispose to poor weight gain. The first step in evaluation of poor weight gain is to take a thorough history of dietary practices and review of systems. If no suspected underlying organic cause is found, management of mild malnutrition should involve parental education and dietary advice, changes to dietary practices, provision of home-based support and referral to community or governmental programs to increase access to food. Recommending a diet diary with calorie counts will both investigate whether inadequate caloric intake is the cause of the child's poor weight gain and also assist caregivers in creating a personalized feeding plan.",

Hypertension associated with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is caused by salt and fluid retention resulting in volume overload.

During development, this plexus migrates cephalad to caudal and incomplete migration results in absence of the plexus in the distal portion of the gastrointestinal tract. This often leads to an inability to pass meconium within the first few days of life and, eventually, large bowel obstruction. An explosive expulsion of feces on rectal examination is a common clinical finding. Barium enema is used to evaluate for congenital megacolon in children. Congenital megacolon is associated with Down syndrome. Patients with Down syndrome are also at increased risk for dementia (Alzheimer type), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, cardiac septal defects, and duodenal atresia.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Dilation of lymphatic vessels of the bowel caused by obstruction is found in intestinal lymphangiectasia. Loss of lymphocytes into the gut secondary to this dilation can lead to lymphopenia and subsequent immunosuppression. It does not contribute to failure to pass meconium after birth. Duodenal atresia (Choice C) is caused by failure of re-canalization of duodenal lumen. Duodenal atresia presents with vomiting and abdominal distension, as well as distension of the stomach and duodenum on abdominal x-ray. Like congenital megacolon, duodenal atresia is more common in children with Down syndrome. Pancreatic enzyme insufficiency (Choice D) is seen in cystic fibrosis because of destruction of the pancreatic duct. The absence of the digestive enzymes made by the pancreas leads to malnutrition (eg, cachexia, muscle wasting), weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and frequent, loose, foul-smelling, sometimes oily stools (steatorrhea). Cystic fibrosis may also present with meconium ileus, another cause of failure to pass stool after birth. However, this patient's presentation is more characteristic of congenital megacolon. Villous atrophy (Choice E) in the small bowel is a characteristic finding of Celiac disease. Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy which causes inflammatory infiltration of the proximal small bowel, which leads to characteristic intraepithelial lymphocytosis, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. Malabsorption of substances in the proximal small bowel ensues, which presents symptomatically as chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, and nutritional deficiencies."

This impairs the erythrocyte's ability to confirm in small vessels of the microcirculation, especially within the spleen , where spherocytes accumulate. Patients often present with splenomegaly, hemolytic anemia, and pigmented gallstones.

It is caused by an absence or deficiency of factor VIII, which is a component of the intrinsic clotting cascade. Factor VIII is required as a cofactor for the activation of factor X to factor Xa, which in turn converts prothrombin to thrombin to complete the process of clot formation.

As a result of primarily autosomal dominant mutations in genes expressed in Schwann cells, the myelinating cells of the peripheral nervous system, peripheral sensory and motor nerves become progressively demyelinated. Patients demonstrate motor weakness and decreased sensation to vibration and proprioception most prominent in the distal lower extremities. Physical examination findings include hyporeflexia or areflexia, along with clumsy walking and consequent musculoskeletal deformities such as pes cavus (high arch of the foot) and hammer toes (toes with an abnormal upward bend of the middle joint). Later in the disease course, atrophy of the lower extremity muscles and intrinsic hand muscle weakness and atrophy may occur. Diagnosis occurs via nerve conduction studies, which may show decreased conduction velocities and prolonged distal motor latencies consistent with demyelinating disease (some disease subtypes show decreased amplitudes suggestive of axonal loss). Treatment is supportive and includes physical therapy.",

Diabetic neuropathy (Choice C) is an acquired, symmetric polyneuropathy that predominantly affects the sensory nerves of the distal lower and upper extremities. Motor weakness typically occurs only in severe cases, after years of hyperglycemia. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Choice D), caused by an inherited mutation in the dystrophin gene, typically presents at age 2 to 3 years with progressive muscle weakness affecting the proximal more than the distal muscles. Cardiac conduction abnormalities are also common. Sensory neuropathy would be atypical.

Intrauterine trauma resulting from abuse to the mother (Choice C) may lead to increased fetal cortisol production and stress physiology.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Bolus of methylprednisolone B) Intravenous administration of calcium chloride C) Intravenous administration of 0.9% sodium chloride D) Plasmapheresis E) Hemodialysis Correct Answer: B. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder with a wide range of presentations. Cutaneous manifestations include an erythematous rash over the malar cheeks that spares the nasolabial folds after sun exposure or discoid lesions with hyperpigmented edges and pink, atrophic centers. Painless oral ulcers and nonspecific hair loss may also occur. Fatigue, joint pain, and a fever are also common presenting signs. Lupus nephritis is a complication of SLE and is common in younger women; it can present with hypertension, hematuria, and increased creatinine in the setting of SLE. Laboratory evaluation generally shows a low complement concentration. Lupus nephritis leads to acute kidney injury (AKI) with increased creatinine, which can present with oliguria or anuria. Patients may be asymptomatic or demonstrate symptoms of uremia (eg, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, altered mental status), hyperkalemia (eg, peaked T waves on ECG), and hypervolemia if the AKI is severe. Severe hyperkalemia leads to decreased myocardial excitability resulting in repolarization abnormalities, conduction dysfunction, heart block, and bradycardia. These abnormalities can manifest on an ECG with peaked T waves, PR interval prolongation, loss of P waves, and, if severe, widened QRS complex and bradycardia. Hyperkalemia resulting in ECG changes requires the emergent administration of calcium gluconate or calcium chloride to induce cardiac cell membrane stabilization. Further treatment after calcium may involve insulin and glucose, ~-adrenergic agonists, or bicarbonate to shift potassium into cells, loop diuretics to facilitate the urinary excretion of potassium, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate to promote binding of potassium within the lumen of the gut. For severe or refractory cases, dialysis may be necessary. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Bolus of methylprednisolone (Choice A) may be used in the treatment of severe manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus, such as lupus nephritis in this patient. However, immediate management of the patient's hyperkalemia with calcium chloride would be the next appropriate step in management. Intravenous administration of 0.9% sodium chloride (Choice C) is less appropriate than stabilization of the cardiac membrane with calcium. This patient does have mild hyponatremia, likely caused by renal failure and volume overload. Immediate management should be focused on hyperkalemia, which can be complicated by bradycardia and cardiac arrest. Plasmapheresis (Choice D) would not be the next step in management for this patient as it does not significantly affect the potassium concentration. Plasmapheresis can be used for the removal of circulating immune complexes or pathogenic antibodies, such as in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Patients with severe hyperkalemia may require hemodialysis (Choice E), however, the first step requires the administration of calcium chloride to emergently stabilize the myocardial membrane prior to attempting to lower potassium concentrations with medications and/or dialysis, if refractory. Educational Objective: Acute renal failure can lead to hypertension and hyperkalemia. Severe hyperkalemia resulting in ECG changes requires the emergent administration of calcium gluconate or calcium chloride to induce cardiac cell membrane stabilization. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 43 of 50 'I 43 .

Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that irreversibly inactivates cyclooxygenase, which prevents the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2: Thromboxane A is involved in platelet activation and its decreased 2 synthesis results in diminished platelet activation. Beyond its effect on platelets, salicylate poisoning in large doses results in a respiratory alkalosis from the stimulation of respiratory centers causing hyperventilation. Subsequently, it results in the development of a delayed anion-gap metabolic acidosis secondary to its decoupling effects on the electron transport chain, resulting in increased anaerobic metabolism and the production of lactate and ketoacids beyond the acidic properties of salicylic acid itself. It does not typically affect sodium and potassium serum concentrations. Patients with salicylate toxicity will present with hyperventilation, gastrointestinal upset, hyperthermia, tinnitus, agitation, delirium, and hallucinations. Management of salicylate toxicity involves systemic alkalinization with a sodium bicarbonate infusion. Patients may need dialysis in the setting of severe altered mental status, end-stage kidney disease, pulmonary edema, or clinical deterioration.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a chronic pruritic inflammatory skin disease common in children that is suggested by pruritus and recurrent eczematous rashes. The rash is initially characterized by erythematous papules and vesicles with exudates and crusting and, with chronic scratching, becomes dry, scaly, and excoriated in a process called lichenification. Flexural dermatitis (eg, in the antecubital fossae) is a common pattern in children and adults with atopic dermatitis, but babies demonstrate a unique pattern, which primarily involves the bilateral cheeks and diaper area, as these areas are both frequently moist and subject to irritation. Treatment of atopic dermatitis begins with gentle skin care: minimizing long baths in warm water which causes drying of the skin, avoiding products with fragrance, and use of bland moisturizers such as petroleum jelly daily. In the case of an infant, keeping the cheeks dry and frequent diaper changes are also important. Flares of eczema are treated with mild- to moderate-potency topical corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone. In children, a moderate-potency topical corticosteroid should not be used consistently for over 2 to 3 weeks because of the potential of systemic absorption, particularly in the diaper area.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Candidiasis can affect mucous membranes or skin. Oral candidiasis demonstrates thick, white plaques on the tongue or buccal mucosa, which can be scraped off. Cutaneous candidiasis demonstrates red, macerated thin plaques with satellite papules. Candidiasis is a common cause of diaper rash, but in this case, given the additional findings on the face, atopic dermatitis is more likely. Food allergy (Choice C) rarely contributes to atopic dermatitis. Patients with diaper dermatitis caused or worsened by food allergy will also demonstrate gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, which is absent in this case. There is no role for specific food avoidance diets in the treatment of pediatric atopic dermatitis. Tinea corporis (Choice D) is caused by a superficial dermatophyte infection of the skin, most often Trichophyton tonsurans. The classic appearance is a round, annular patch with a scaly border. Potassium hydroxide preparation will disclose hyphae. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (Choice E) is a life-threatening adverse cutaneous drug reaction. Features such as skin pain, sloughing, or mucosal involvement are concerning for toxic epidermal necrolysis. This patient's lichenified papules and plaques are more consistent with atopic dermatitis."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Precocious puberty is defined as the onset of pubertal development and secondary sexual characteristics prior to 8 years of age in girls and 9 years of age in boys. Precocious puberty can be central, which is caused by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This early activation can be idiopathic or caused by central nervous system abnormalities, such as a brain tumor. Precocious puberty can also be peripheral, which is caused by the release of excess sex hormones from the gonads or adrenal glands, or potentially the ectopic production of human chorionic gonadotropin from a germ-cell tumor. Initial evaluation involves the measurement of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone {LH), and estradiol or testosterone, which allows the provider to differentiate between central and peripheral causes of precocious puberty. Central precocious puberty is further evaluated with brain imaging, whereas peripheral precocious puberty is further evaluated with ultrasonography of the testes, ovaries, or adrenal glands. Treatment is dependent on the underlying pathology. As testicular size is based on the production of FSH, this patient more likely has a peripheral cause of precocious puberty with hyperandrogenism leading to inhibition of the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), FSH, and LH. Adrenal causes of precocious puberty include congenital adrenal hyperplasia and androgen-secreting tumors. Treatment for precocious puberty is dependent on the underlying pathology.",

It can be central, with increased FSH and LH concentrations, or peripheral, with decreased FSH and LH concentrations.

This patient's laboratory testing instead demonstrates increased TSH concentrations, which indicates a dysfunctional thyroid gland as the cause of hypothyroidism. Measurement of serum thyroid-binding globulin concentration (Choice C) or a thyroid scan (Choice E) may ultimately be indicated to elucidate the cause of hypothyroidism. However, the physician must first perform repeat laboratory testing to confirm that the patient continues to demonstrate hypothyroidism. Thyroid-binding globulin assists in the transport of thyroid hormone to its target tissues, and decreased concentrations may indicate thyroid-binding globulin deficiency or thyroid gland dysgenesis. Levothyroxine therapy (Choice F) may be indicated to treat congenital primary hypothyroidism.

Torticollis refers to an abnormal contraction of the neck muscles that results in the head tilting to one side. Congenital torticollis typically presents beginning at 2 to 4 weeks of age with a preferred head position, decreased cervical range of motion, and a mass of the SCM. Hypothesized causes include birth trauma (eg, forceps delivery) or intrauterine malposition of the head, which may lead to SCM injury and consequent fibrosis and contracture of the SCM. The fibrosis may present as a mass of the SCM on physical examination. Birth trauma or intrauterine head malposition may also lead to plagiocephaly (flattening of the head). The diagnosis of congenital torticollis is clinical. Treatment requires physical therapy interventions to stretch the SCM, which leads to the resolution of torticollis in most infants.",

A 2-month -old boy is brought to the physician because of a 2-week history of sweating and fatigue during feedings . His mother has also noticed that he seems to breathe fast and has a pounding heart rate at rest. He was born at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery . He is at the 50th percentile for length and 5th percentile for weight. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 145/min , respirations are 70/min , and blood pressure is 92/40 mm Hg. Examination shows prominence of the left precordium and a palpable parasternal lift. A blowing holosystolic murmur is heard best over the lower left sternal border. A chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings . Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms? A) Anomalous pulmonary blood return B) Increased peripheral vascular resistance C) Increased systemic vascular resistance D) Intermittent supraventricular tachycardia E) Left-to-right shunt Correct Answer: E. A left-to-right shunt from a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most likely explanation of this patient's cardiomegaly, increased pulmonary vascular markings, and failure to thrive. VSDs are among the most common congenital heart malformations. The genetic cause ofVSDs is heterogeneous and includes known associations with well-defined syndromes such as Down, DiGeorge, or Holt-Oram syndrome. It may also occur in isolation and via nonspecific, random mutations and individual point mutations that are de nova. VSDs are characterized by a holosystolic murmur best heard in the left lower sternal border and may have an associated palpable thrill. VSDs result in a left-to-right shunt, which increases pulmonary blood flow. This leads to remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature and resultant smooth muscle hypertrophy. In turn, concentric narrowing of the pulmonary arterioles occurs, which results in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension. If severe and progressive enough, this can cause increased right ventricular pressures and associated myocardial hypertrophy, which subsequently results in reversal of the shunt (Eisenmenger syndrome), presenting with shortness of breath and cyanosis. Increased pulmonary blood flow results in increased blood return to the left atrium, which may cause left atrial enlargement. Incorrect Answer: A, B, C, and D. Anomalous pulmonary blood return (Choice A) can be total or partial. Total anomalous pulmonary venous return is a congenital heart defect whereby oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins returns to the right atrium, not the left atrium. The presence of a second shunt is necessary to shunt blood from the right to left circulations. It does not present with a holosystolic murmur. Increased peripheral vascular resistance (Choice B), which is also known as systemic vascular resistance (Choice C), refers to increased tone within the peripheral vasculature. It is a normal response to decreased cardiac output in an attempt to maintain peripheral organ perfusion pressure. It does not explain this patient's presentation. Intermittent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) (Choice D) refers to the presence of cardiac arrhythmias that present with a rapid heart rate originating from above the ventricles (eg, multifocal atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia). ECG would likely demonstrate a narrow QRS complex with or without P waves. A holosystolic murmur is not seen in this condition and does not explain the patient's presentation. Educational Objective: VSDs are common cardiac malformations that result in a left-to-right intracardiac shunt. They may form in isolation or in conjunction with other malformations.

Septic arthritis commonly occurs in children as a result of trauma to the joint permitting the translocation of cutaneous organisms (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) and may also occur in adolescents as a result of the dissemination of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a sexually transmitted bacterium that initially causes cervicitis, urethritis, or pharyngitis and may hematogenously disseminate to cause septic arthritis. Septic arthritis classically presents with a painful, erythematous, swollen joint along with systemic signs and symptoms of illness such as fever, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, and nausea. Gonococcal arthritis may present with monoarticular or asymmetric polyarticular disease and may feature adjacent tenosynovitis and dermatitis. The most common sites of gonococcal infection are the knee, ankle, wrist, and elbow, though the sternoclavicular joint may also be affected. In all causes of septic arthritis, serum laboratory values typically show leukocytosis along with increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein concentrations. Diagnosis requires arthrocentesis, which typically demonstrates purulent aspirate fluid with an increased concentration of neutrophil-predominant white blood cells. In gonococcal arthritis, culture of the aspirate fluid may disclose gram-negative diplococci. Management requires antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin along with source control.",

This patient with chronic vesicoureteral reflux and a history of recurrent pyelonephritis with new onset headache and dizziness in the setting of hypertension most likely has hypertensive urgency that has developed as a result of chronic kidney disease. Chronic vesicoureteral reflux predisposes patients to the development of recurrent pyelonephritis as urine from the bladder travels in a retrograde fashion to the kidneys. Recurrent pyelonephritis can lead to scarring of the renal parenchyma and loss of nephron mass, which decreases the glomerular filtration rate, and can lead to chronic kidney disease. Hypertension is a common complication of chronic renal disease and results primarily from impaired handling of sodium leading to expansion of the intravascular volume and subsequent systolic hypertension. Over time, chronic vascular remodeling and increased systemic vascular resistance lead to an increase in diastolic blood pressure. Assessment of the serum urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations is an appropriate first step in assessing kidney function. Increases in both are suggestive of kidney injury.

Hyperstimulation of the TSH receptor leads to overproduction of thyroid hormone and a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland on physical examination, along with signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism including weight loss, insomnia, palpitations, heat intolerance, warm skin, tremor, diaphoresis, and pretibial myxedema. TSH-receptor-stimulating antibodies also stimulate orbital fibroblasts and lead to thyroid ophthalmopathy, which is characterized by the expansion of orbital fat and connective tissue with resultant exophthalmos, lid lag, and restrictive strabismus. Thyroid ophthalmopathy may lead to diplopia, corneal exposure, compressive optic neuropathy, and a cosmetic appearance that is distressing for patients. Thyroid laboratory studies typically demonstrate primary hyperthyroidism with increased thyroxine and triiodothyronine, and decreased TSH. Radioactive iodine uptake nuclear scintigraphy typically demonstrates diffuse, abnormally increased uptake of the thyroid gland without a discrete nodule. Graves disease is treated with antithyroid drugs such as methimazole and propylthiouracil, and radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid gland. Thyroid ophthalmopathy typically responds well to topical lubrication, although severe cases may require intravenous corticosteroids and a staged surgical approach.",

        "A": "Levothyroxine overdose may present with signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism including tachycardia, hypertension, tremor, and anxiety. Severe cases may cause convulsions and coma. This patient's history of progressive symptoms over a four-month period, as well as her symptoms of exophthalmos and lid lag, are not consistent with an overdose event. Lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland (Choice B) is characteristic of Hashimoto disease. While patients with Hashimoto disease may present with transient symptoms of hyperthyroidism during the acute stage, patients progress to develop signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, including fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, hyporeflexia, myxedema, and dry, cool skin. Hashimoto disease does not cause orbital findings of exophthalmos and lid lag. Malignant infiltration of the thyroid gland (Choice C) may lead to symptoms of hyperthyroidism through the destruction of thyroid follicular cells with resultant release of thyroid hormone, though patients are generally euthyroid. This mechanism would not cause orbital findings of exophthalmos and lid lag. Thyroid-stimulating hormone-producing pituitary tumor (Choice D) would lead to hyperthyroidism and laboratory findings of an increased serum concentration of TSH, as well as thyroid hormone."

These neoplasms present as red or purple subcutaneous tumors. The increased blood flow may cause the affected area to be warm and swollen or even cause a limb length discrepancy. Signs of other hemangiomas, such as a bruit over the liver, may also be present. The large, convoluted vascular architecture causes platelet adhesion and trapping. This trapping leads to consumption offibrinogen and ongoing fibrinolysis, causing a consumptive coagulopathy. Patients present, as in this case, with mucocutaneous bleeding (bruising and petechiae), which could not be explained by trauma. They also demonstrate thrombocytopenia on laboratory evaluation.

Mycosis fungoides presents with scaly, wrinkled patches in sun-protected areas, more often in adults than children. Cystic hygroma (Choice B) and lymphangioma (Choice E) are both lymphatic malformations. Cystic hygroma may be seen in association with Turner syndrome as a subcutaneous mass of the neck. However, neither of these are associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome or the development of thrombocytopenia. Juvenile xanthogranuloma (Choice D) is an uncommon benign proliferation of histiocytes. It clinically appears as a solitary orange-pink papule on the face, neck, or trunk of a child. It is not a vascular neoplasm and does not cause Kasabach-Merritt syndrome.",

The patches of alopecia may demonstrate black dots that represent broken hairs. When a significant inflammatory response to the fungal infection occurs, a kerion develops. A kerion is a boggy and swollen lesion on examination. Tinea capitis is caused by dermatophytes including Trichophyton rubrum, Epidermophyton floccosum, and Microsporum canis. First-line treatment of tinea capitis is with an oral antifungal, usually griseofulvin or terbinafine. Close contacts of patients should be examined as the condition is contagious and can be spread through fomites, such as shared combs, pillows, or hats.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Topical corticosteroid therapy will worsen tinea capitis by inhibiting the inflammatory response necessary to eliminate the infection. Superficial dermatophyte infections treated with topical corticosteroids may become more severe. Tinea treated with topical corticosteroids is often referred to as tinea incognito, because of the severe and unusual morphologies that these infections take on after treatment with topical corticosteroids. Tinea capitis is a fungal infection, not a bacterial infection, and thus oral antibacterial therapy (Choice B) is unnecessary. Tinea capitis and kerion may become secondarily colonized with skin flora, such as S. aureus, in which case antibiotics may be necessary, but this is atypical. Oral antibacterial therapy is appropriate for bacterial skin infections including cellulitis, erysipelas, and severe folliculitis. Surgical excision (Choice D) is unnecessary as the infection can be treated with oral antifungals. In children, dermatologic surgical excision is generally reserved for neoplastic processes. No intervention necessary (Choice E) is not the standard of care for tinea capitis. Without appropriate antifungal treatment, the infection and inflammatory response will worsen. Inadequate treatment puts the patient's close contacts at risk for developing the infection as well."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Neonatal sepsis is categorized often on the basis of time from parturition, since the period of time in which symptoms begin may indicate which pathogen is likely involved, thereby guiding therapy. Early-onset neonatal sepsis (within 72 hours of birth) is marked by symptoms of lethargy, seizures, poor feeding, weak cry, and hypotonia. It presents with tachycardia, tachypnea, occasionally fever, and often with an examination that is nonfocal. If examination findings are present, they may reflect the source of infection or may reflect complications of sepsis such as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Early-onset neonatal sepsis generally occurs as a result of pathogens acquired from the mother, either through hematogenous or transplacental spread or, commonly, contact acquisition in the birth canal. The most common pathogens associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis include Streptococcus agalactiae (group B), Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Listeria monocytogenes. Syndromes of serious bacterial infection include bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia. Late-onset neonatal sepsis (presenting 72 hours or more after birth) more commonly occurs from environmental pathogens in addition to those acquired from the mother. Pneumonia is more common in early-onset sepsis, and presents with cough, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia, increased work of breathing, and rhonchi on auscultation. Workup for any suspected case of sepsis in a child younger than 30 days of age is broad, and should include a complete blood count, urinalysis, blood cultures, chest x-ray, and lumbar puncture at a minimum, since symptoms in this population are vague and nonspecific, limiting the utility of the history and physical examination to guide workup. X-rays in neonatal pneumonia disclose focal or diffuse airspace disease or may show diffuse interstitial infiltrates suggestive of respiratory distress syndrome. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover the common pathogens.",

        "B": "Meconium aspiration occurs when the fetus inhales meconium into the lungs and is a known complication of labor and delivery. It presents with signs of respiratory distress (eg, cough, tachypnea, hypoxia, use of accessory muscles of respiration) and severity is a function of the volume of meconium aspirated. It is generally self-resolving when occurring in small amounts; large aspirations can lead to pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis. Pneumococcal meningitis (Choice C) most commonly occurs in adults, whereas common pathogens causing meningitis in the neonate include Streptococcus agalactiae (group B), E. coli, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and L monocytogenes. Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly P. carini1) pneumonia (Choice D) generally occurs in immunocompromised persons and was seen commonly in individuals with advanced HIV prior to the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Patients classically present with cough, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia, with rhonchi on lung auscultation and prominent perihilar and multifocal infiltrates on chest x-ray. It would be rare in a neonate. Respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia (Choice E) is one of the most common causes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 2 years of age. In the neonatal period, bacterial infection is more common and is also more consistent with bandemia and diffuse infiltrates on x-ray."

It classically presents in children with bloody diarrhea accompanied by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. Other pathogenic precipitants include S. pneumoniae, Salmonella species, and Shigel/a species infections. This patient presents following several days of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, suggesting a bacterial or viral trigger. The abrupt change of pallor and lethargy, along with red urine and falling urine output suggests the presence of both anemia and renal failure. Physical examination may show petechiae, purpura, or ecchymosis, all of which are signs of thrombocytopenia. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates thrombocytopenia, increased creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentrations, and often multiple electrolyte derangements depending on the extent of volume depletion and acute renal failure. Treatment is supportive and may include plasma exchange; many cases self-resolve. Generally, platelet transfusion is contraindicated because of the risk for worsening the degree of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia since platelet administration has been postulated to worsen the degree of thrombosis. If fever and neurologic symptoms are concomitantly present along with the anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is diagnosed. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E.

Patients present with hemoptysis and nephritic syndrome, which may be rapidly progressive and cause renal failure or death if not treated. Henoch-Schonlein nephritis (Choice C) is a vasculitis that classically presents in a child with renal failure and palpable purpura on the lower extremities following an upper respiratory infection. Patients often complain of arthralgias and abdominal pain, and intussusception is a known complication. Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (Choice D) is a nephritic syndrome presenting with gross or microscopic hematuria, peripheral or periorbital edema, and hypertension in a child, typically two weeks after infection with group A ~-hemolytic streptococci. Laboratory evaluation may show low serum C3 concentrations and positive anti-streptolysin O and anti-DNase titers. Systemic vasculitis (Choice E) describes a broad class of diseases that encompass small, medium, and large arterial inflammation affecting various organ systems, commonly the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and lung. While vasculitides may present following illness, the classic triad of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure makes HUS a more likely diagnosis. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 23 of 50 Na+ 138 mEq/L Cl· 118 mEq/L K+ 6.5 mEq/L HCO 15 mEq/L 3 Creatinine 2.6 mg/dL Urea nitrogen 60 mg/dL Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Goodpasture syndrome B) Hemolytic uremic syndrome. C) Henoch-Schonlein nephritis D) Postinfectious glomerulonephritis E) Systemic vasculitis Correct Answer: B. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is typically associated with infection from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H? caused by the production of Shiga toxin. It classically presents in children with bloody diarrhea accompanied by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. Other pathogenic precipitants include S. pneumoniae, Salmonella species, and Shigel/a species infections. This patient presents following several days of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, suggesting a bacterial or viral trigger. The abrupt change of pallor and lethargy, along with red urine and falling urine output suggests the presence of both anemia and renal failure. Physical examination may show petechiae, purpura, or ecchymosis, all of which are signs of thrombocytopenia. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates thrombocytopenia, increased creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentrations, and often multiple electrolyte derangements depending on the extent of volume depletion and acute renal failure. Treatment is supportive and may include plasma exchange; many cases self-resolve. Generally, platelet transfusion is contraindicated because of the risk for worsening the degree of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia since platelet administration has been postulated to worsen the degree of thrombosis. If fever and neurologic symptoms are concomitantly present along with the anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is diagnosed. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E.

A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination . He is active and has been healthy except for an episode of otitis media 3 weeks ago treated with amoxicillin. His parents emigrated from Vietnam . His diet consists mainly of fruits and vegetables ; he occasionally eats fish and chicken but no red meat. Examination shows no abnormalities . Laboratory studies show : Hemoglobin 10 g/dL Mean corpuscular volume 64 µm 3 Leukocyte count 6100/mm 3 Platelet count 225 ,000/mm 3 Red cell distribution width 10% (N=13%-15%) A blood smear is shown . Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's anemia? A) Antibiotic-induced autoimmune hemolysis B) Iron deficiency C Thalassemia mino D) Transient postinfectious bone marrow suppression E) Vitamin B (cobalamin) deficiency 12 Correct Answer: B. This asymptomatic child with mild anemia, microcytosis, and low red cell distribution width (RDW) who is of southeast Asian heritage most likely has either a- or ~-thalassemia minor. Thalassemia is characterized by the decreased synthesis of globin chains. Normal adult hemoglobin is known as HbA (a~2l and is composed of two a-globin chains and two ~-globin chains. There are four a-globin alleles and two ~-globin alleles. Mutations in one or two a-globin alleles or one ~-globin allele causes thalassemia minor. Thalassemia trait is common in southeast Asia and commonly presents with mild microcytic anemia. Supportive features include the presence of target cells on peripheral blood smear (pictured in the photomicrograph), a low RDW (which indicates that most erythrocytes are of the same size with little variation), and persistence of microcytosis. Iron concentrations can be measured to rule out iron deficiency. Other cell lines including platelets and white blood cells should be within normal ranges. Hemoglobin electrophoresis can be used to distinguish between a- and ~-thalassemia minor. There is no treatment required for thalassemia minor as the resultant anemia is usually not severe. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Antibiotic-induced autoimmune hemolysis (Choice A) can occur after exposure to penicillins and cephalosporins, but the onset is typically acute and occurs within hours to days. While hemolysis can occur weeks later, it is less common. Additionally, patients would be expected to present with normocytic anemia and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Haptoglobin concentrations can be measured and will be low, while the reticulocyte count will typically be increased. Iron deficiency (Choice C) is a common cause of anemia in menstruating women, strict vegans or vegetarians, and those with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding or celiac disease. It commonly presents with microcytosis, although often with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) that is higher than what is seen in thalassemia, and an increased RDW indicating the release of premature erythrocytes from the bone marrow. The measurement of serum iron and ferritin, which will be low, are used to make the diagnosis. Transient postinfectious bone marrow suppression (Choice D) may occur following viral infections, but more commonly presents with leukopenia, which is not present in this case. In patients with sickle cell disease, infection with parvovirus B19 can cause a transient aplastic crisis and severe anemia. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 24 of 50 B) Iron deficiency C) Thalassemia mino D) Transient postinfectious bone marrow suppression E) Vitamin B (cobalamin) deficiency 12 Correct Answer: B.

In patients with sickle cell disease, infection with parvovirus B19 can cause a transient aplastic crisis and severe anemia. Vitamin B (cobalamin) deficiency (Choice E) results in megaloblastic anemia, which presents with macrocytosis and hypersegmented neutrophils. It 12 is more common in patients who chronically abuse alcohol, or in patients with a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, Crohn disease, or malabsorptive disorders. This patient demonstrates a microcytic anemia. Educational Objective: Thalassemia minor can occur as a result of mutations or deletions in one of the ~-globin alleles or in one or two of the a-globin alleles, leading to the impaired production of globin chains. Patients typically demonstrate a mild microcytic anemia with a low RDW and normal concentrations of leukocytes and platelets. Hemoglobin electrophoresis can be used to distinguish between these two entities. Treatment is often not necessary. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 25 of 50 'I",

It presents with frequent bacterial infections, oculocutaneous albinism, peripheral neuropathy, and progressive neurologic dysfunction. Chronic granulomatous disease (Choice B) is caused by NADPH oxidase deficiency and results in impaired intracellular killing of pathogens. This presents as recurrent pyogenic infections with catalase-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus with normal concentrations of leukocytes and immunoglobulins. Complement deficiency (Choice C), particularly of the terminal complement cascade, typically presents with recurrent infections with Neisseria species.

HIV infection acquired via vertical transmission in the perinatal period is the most likely diagnosis in this patient with oral thrush, diffuse lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and Pneumocystis pneumonia. HIV transmission may occur at any time during gestation but is most commonly acquired at or around the time of delivery and in the immediate postpartum period when children are breastfeeding. Transmission is uncommon if the mother is taking antiretroviral therapy and has a low HIV viral load. As a result of universal screening for HIV in most developed countries, the incidence of perinatal and pediatric HIV has decreased, although this is not true around the world. Most patients present within the first few months of birth with recurrent pneumonia or opportunistic infections. AIDS-defining illnesses in children are numerous but include P. jiroveci pneumonia, as in this patient. Initial evaluation should include measurement of the HIV viral load with concomitant testing for mutations. While this patient should receive treatment for her P. jiroveci pneumonia and thrush, she should also be started on antiretroviral therapy once an HIV infection is confirmed. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, E, F, G, H, and I. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (Choice A) is caused by mutations in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene (LY ST) essential for normal formation and transportation of lysosomes within the cell. It presents with frequent bacterial infections, oculocutaneous albinism, peripheral neuropathy, and progressive neurologic dysfunction. Chronic granulomatous disease (Choice B) is caused by NADPH oxidase deficiency and results in impaired intracellular killing of pathogens.

Hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome (Choice E) is caused by mutations in the JAK-STAT signaling cascade, which impairs the development and function of T helper 17 cells (Th n). Patients present with recurrent skin infections, noninflamed abscesses (cold abscesses), and diffuse atopic dermatitis. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCIO) (Choice F) describes a syndrome of failed Band T lymphocyte activity leading to impaired cellular and humoral immunity. This commonly occurs as a result of adenosine deaminase deficiency and presents with recurrent viral, bacterial, and fungal infections starting around the time of birth. Thymic-parathyroid dysplasia (DiGeorge syndrome) (Choice G) presents with thymic hypoplasia or aplasia and consequent impaired immunity, conotruncal cardiac defects, hypocalcemia caused by parathyroid hypoplasia, and craniofacial abnormalities. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (Choice H) is caused by a mutation in the WAS gene on the X-chromosome that encodes a protein essential for actin cytoskeleton rearrangement that occurs during interactions between T lymphocytes, antigen-presenting cells, and B lymphocytes, leading to an impaired innate and adaptive immune system. Patients present with eczema, thrombocytopenia, and infections with encapsulated bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Choice I) occurs as a result of mutations in the BTK gene that encodes a tyrosine kinase essential for all stages of B lymphocyte development and proliferation. Patients lack functioning B lymphocytes and therefore have recurrent infections caused by impaired humoral immunity."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "An ECG should be obtained in this patient with unexplained exertional syncope. There are several high-risk cardiac conditions that can present with syncope in pediatric patients, and these can be classified as structural defects, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery anomalies, or valvular aortic stenosis, or can be a result of electrical abnormalities, such as long QT syndrome or Brugada syndrome. Evaluation with ECG is mandatory in all patients with unexplained syncope. Of these, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is one of the more common causes of syncope. It is generally inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and may be the cause of death in this patient's cousin. Syncope occurs as a result of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction with a consequent decrease in cardiac output leading to decreased cerebral perfusion and syncope. Decreased perfusion of the coronary arteries can cause angina and increase the risk for ventricular arrhythmias, although this is not always seen. ECG classically demonstrates left ventricular hypertrophy with non-specific T wave abnormalities in the precordial leads. Deep, narrow, symmetric Q waves may also be seen in the lateral and inferior leads. Echocardiography should be subsequently performed to evaluate the underlying cardiac anatomy, which would allow for assessment of the degree of LVOT obstruction, if present.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Reassurance is inappropriate. Patients with unexplained exertional syncope are at a high-risk for sudden cardiac death. ECG is a low-cost and noninvasive means of assessing for underlying cardiac defects and should be performed as soon as possible. Chest x-ray (Choice B) could be considered in patients with exertional shortness of breath, wheezing, or a prodrome suggestive of bacterial pneumonia, but this patient's presentation is more consistent with a cardiac cause of syncope. EEG (Choice D) is not necessary as this patient's syncopal episode was not associated with classic seizure-like activity. Often, seizures that result in syncope are preceded by an aura, and patients are typically confused upon waking, which is known as a postictal state. The patient's history is not consistent with a seizure. Convulsions can also be seen during syncope. Admission to the hospital for observation (Choice E) is not necessary. Had the patient not regained consciousness or required cardiopulmonary resuscitation, admission to the hospital would be appropriate. This patient should be advised not to participate in exercise until a complete evaluation has been undertaken, but this can be performed in the outpatient setting."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Patellofemoral instability is a common cause of anterior knee pain, which is caused by an anatomical defect leading to excessive movement of the patella. It is exacerbated by overuse and activities that put weight on a flexed knee, such as running and jumping. On examination, passive movement of the patella demonstrates increased sliding of the patella in either the lateral axis or superior-inferior axis. The patella may also be tender to palpation. The mainstay of treatment for patellar instability is activity modification and physical therapy. The goal of physical therapy is to strengthen the surrounding muscles and recruit stability of the patella from these muscles, as well as improve the position and balance of the limb overall. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be prescribed for use as needed.",

Growing pains (Choice C) are recurrent, self-limited pains in the extremities that occur during childhood and early adolescence. Physical examination is normal. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (Choice D), or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, is characterized by fever, arthritis, an evanescent salmon-colored rash, and lymphadenopathy. Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (Choice E) is an idiopathic avascular necrosis of the femoral head, which often presents in young males. The classic presentation includes a slow onset of hip pain that is worsened by activity and associated with a limp. The pain may or may not be relieved with rest. Neuroblastoma with bone marrow metastases (Choice F) is a malignancy of neuroendocrine cells associated with the sympathetic nervous tissue. Bone marrow metastases classically cause pain at night, and the patient would likely appear ill and cachectic. Septic arthritis (Choice H) results from a bacterial infection of the synovial joint space, most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus. The affected joint demonstrates pain, swelling, and erythema. Arthrocentesis is indicated for the evaluation of monoarticular erythema and swelling to evaluate for septic arthritis, which characteristically discloses purulent synovial fluid with >50,000 leukocytes/mm"

In this case, a lactic acidosis secondary to inadequate perfusion of organs and forced anaerobic metabolism is likely the cause of the metabolic acidosis as a result of hypoxemia. If functioning correctly, the respiratory system compensates for the acidosis by increasing minute ventilation, which eliminates carbon dioxide, an acid. This results in a decreased pCO and an increased pH to approximately normal range. This patient's increased pCO suggests that respiratory 2 2 compensation is not only inadequate but that there is also a concomitant respiratory acidosis.

The vaccine should be administered at age 11 to 12 years, since the immune response is most robust before the teenage years and the onset of sexual activity may occur during the teenage years. HPV is sexually transmitted and is associated with genital warts along with premalignant and malignant lesions of the cervical, anogenital, and oropharyngeal regions. HPV vaccines have significantly decreased the incidence and prevalence of HPV and protect against HPV-related malignancies such as cervical and anal squamous cell carcinoma.",

        "B": "Menarche is unrelated to vaccine efficacy. The vaccine should be given to patients at age 11 to 12 years because of immune response patterns and the onset of sexual behavior, which are not associated with the timing of menarche. The vaccine should be administered to all patients regardless of risk factors such as sexual activity or condom use (Choices C and E) to promote herd immunity. Giving the vaccine after the onset of sexual activity would not protect patients from HPV infection, and condoms decrease but do not eliminate the risk for HPV transmission. The first Pap smear is recommended at age 21 years (Choice D). By age 21, many patients have initiated sexual activity and may already be infected with HPV. HPV infection typically occurs years before concerning cervical lesions may be detected by Pap smear."

Adequate oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues occurs in several steps: oxygenation of the lung alveoli, binding of oxygen to hemoglobin in erythrocytes, and delivery of oxygenated erythrocytes to peripheral tissues with an adequate cardiac output. Peripheral oxygen delivery is mathematically defined by the product of the cardiac output and the arterial oxygen content. Arterial oxygen content is significantly lower in the setting of severe anemia, as in this patient, because there is a substantially lower hemoglobin content. As such, cardiac output must increase to accommodate a substantially lower arterial oxygen content if oxygen delivery to the peripheral tissues is to remain the same. This phenomenon accounts for the patient's active precordium and grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur. Additionally, this patient likely suffers from a component of sepsis given his persistent upper respiratory tract infection and fever, which would increase the patient's risk for concomitant septic shock. In the early stages of septic shock, the cardiac output is also increased in an attempt to maintain mean arterial pressure.",

Peripheral tissue oxygenation (Choice C) will either remain the same or decrease further if the patient's cardiac output cannot maintain its increased state and/or the hemoglobin concentration further decreases. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (Choice D) is likely to be normal or low because of the patient's hypovolemia. In older patients with SCD, chronic high-output cardiac states can lead to pulmonary hypertension and increase the PVR. Systemic afterload (Choice E) is likely low or normal in this patient with components of both hypovolemic and septic shock. The patient presents with a severe anemia and evidence of hypovolemia on examination, which would typically result in an increased systemic vascular resistance in an attempt to maintain mean arterial pressure.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Complement system immunodeficiency is the most likely diagnosis in this patient with meningococcemia. Late component complement deficiency (CS to C9) is a common finding in patients who have recurrent infections with Neisseria species, and increases susceptibility to this pathogen through failure to form the membrane attack complex (MAC). Complement activation can occur through the classical, lectin, or alternative pathways, with each pathway converging at the point where C3 is cleaved by C3 convertase, releasing C3a and C3b. Following this, C3b is incorporated into the C3 convertase complex, which subsequently acts on CS convertase to lower the Km (increase the affinity) of CS convertase for its substrate, CS. Cleavage of CS results in the formation of C5a, a potent chemoattractant, and C5b. C5b complexes with C6, C7, CB, and C9 (terminal complement factors) to form the MAC, which allows for the creation of a transmembrane pore that interferes with the integrity of the cellular membrane, leading to cell lysis. Deficiencies of terminal complement factors impair the formation of the MAC and preferentially predispose patients to infection with Neisseria species. While most patients experience mild infection with atypical serotypes, they can also develop fulminant meningococcemia from typical Neisseria serotypes, as in this patient. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, E, and F. AIDS (Choice A) can develop in pediatric patients who have acquired the infection vertically during the perinatal period from a mother with untreated HIV infection. Most patients present with evidence of recurrent pneumonia, infection with atypical organisms such as Mycobacterium avium, or with opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia. It commonly presents within months of birth but can also develop many years after birth. Child abuse (Choice B) should be suspected in cases where bruising is located in atypical locations such as the back or is with an atypical appearance, such as a linear mark on the upper arm. Purpura on the trunk and extremities is classic for meningococcemia and is far more likely in this patient with sepsis and a family history of meningococcemia. Congenital humoral system immunodeficiency (Choice D) is caused by numerous syndromes, including X-linked agammaglobulinemia, whereby B lymphocyte development is impaired by mutations in the BTK gene. Low or absent immunoglobulin secretion increases the risk for recurrent bacterial infections, but patients present within the first eighteen months of life. Increased susceptibility to Neisseria species, in particular, is not characteristic of this disease. Frequent exposure to multiple pathogens (Choice E) is incorrect. Healthy children are exposed to numerous pathogens on a daily basis and most do not develop invasive bacterial infections. While Neisseria meningitidis is associated with outbreaks in college dorms and military barracks, there is no such history in this case. Vitamin A deficiency (Choice F) is classically associated with xerophthalmia but does not cause the findings described in this patient. Educational Objective: Deficiency of the terminal complement proteins prevents the formation of the MAC, which is a critical component in the complement cascade, typically leading to the formation of a pore in the membrane of pathogenic organisms. Deficiency predisposes to recurrent and invasive infections with Neisseria species. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 38 of 50 'I",

Oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart passes to the right side of the heart, where it then returns to the pulmonary vasculature. If severe and untreated, the increased blood flow through the pulmonary vasculature can trigger pathologic remodeling of the vessel walls, leading to pulmonary hypertension. Right ventricular hypertrophy follows, causing a right-to-left shunt to occur. This phenomenon is called Eisenmenger syndrome. However, in this case, the pulmonary hypertension is secondary to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, not intracardiac left-to-right shunting. Peripheral pulmonary stenosis (Choice C) and pulmonary outlet obstruction (Choice E) are potential causes of pulmonary hypertension and increased right-sided heart pressure. In this case, the patient's history is more consistent with bronchopulmonary dysplasia as a cause of pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Intussusception occurs when a segment of bowel telescopes into an adjacent segment, resulting in colicky abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and potential bloody, mucoid stools. Classically, it presents in an infant or young child with recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain often punctuated by asymptomatic periods. Intussusception typically occurs due to the presence of a pathologic lead point, often lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphadenopathy, Meckel diverticulum, stricture, or malignancy, which acts to draw one segment of bowel into an adjacent segment during peristalsis. If the intussusception self-resolves, there may be no symptoms. If it does not resolve, traction on mesenteric vessels can result in hypoperfusion of the segment with resultant inflammation, hemorrhage, obstruction, and pain. It may be detected on physical examination as an elongated mass, often in the right upper quadrant. Diagnosis consists of clinical history, physical examination, and is supported by imaging. Ultrasound evaluation is preferred in young children and will show telescoping interposed bowel segments in longitudinal orientation, or a targetoid appearance in transverse orientation. A contrast enema can also demonstrate intussusception with appearance of a mass prolapsing into the lumen and an inability of the contrast to reach the proximal bowel. Treatment of an ileocolic intussusception requires the administration of a contrast enema, which reduces the intussusception. Contrast enema is both diagnostic and therapeutic in this setting. Surgery may be required in cases where there is repetitive failure of the enema to reduce the intussusception or if the patient presents with symptoms concerning for bowel necrosis or perforation. , q (> ¢@  © € € @",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This neonate presents with findings consistent with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV, also known as human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), belongs to the family of herpesviruses, and possesses a large, double-stranded DNA genome. Congenital CMV infection presents with intrauterine growth restriction, microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, hearing loss, seizures, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and petechial rash. The diagnosis is confirmed with viral culture or polymerase chain amplification from urine or blood within the first week of life. It is the most common cause of nonhereditary sensorineural hearing loss. In about 10% of cases, hearing loss may be an isolated finding without other symptoms of infection present. Hearing loss is also the most common sequela of an initially asymptomatic neonate. Fetal hydrops is a potential complication of CMV infection, although it is less common than with parvovirus B19 infection. Intracranial calcifications demonstrate a characteristic periventricular distribution and may be detected by ultrasonography or computed tomography. Pregnant women most often contract CMV through exposure from young children, often through daycare centers. A primary maternal infection has a high risk for vertical transmission via the placenta to the fetus. Treatment is with antiviral agents, such as ganciclovir or valganciclovir.",

SS and TEN are distinguished from each other based on the amount of body surface area involvement (<10% for SJS and >30% for TEN) and are driven by the same underlying pathophysiology. Common drugs implicated in the development of SJS or TEN include beta-lactam antibiotics, antiepileptics, sulfa- containing medications including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and allopurinol. SS and TEN are characterized by confluent areas of dusky erythema with desquamation of the epidermis. It can be distinguished from a morbilliform drug eruption by the presence of skin pain, desquamation, and mucosal involvement. SJS and TEN are often complicated by infection of the denuded areas of skin, thus meticulous wound care, preferably in a burn unit, is critical. The first step in treatment is to identify and discontinue the offending agents. Supportive care in a burn intensive care unit setting has been shown to improve mortality, but the role of other agents including systemic steroids, cyclosporine, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are controversial.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This newborn presents with findings consistent with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV, also known as human herpesvirus 5, belongs to the family of herpesviruses, and possesses a large, double-stranded DNA genome. Pregnant women most often contract CMV through exposure from young children, often through daycare centers. A primary maternal infection has a high risk for vertical transmission via the placenta to the fetus. Congenital CMV infection presents with intrauterine growth restriction, microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, hearing loss, seizures, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and petechial rash. Congenital CMV infection is the most common cause of nonhereditary sensorineural hearing loss. In about 10% of cases, hearing loss may be an isolated finding without other symptoms of infection present. Hearing loss is also the most common sequela of an initially asymptomatic newborn. Fetal hydrops is a potential complication of CMV infection, although less common than in the setting of congenital parvovirus B19 infection. Intracranial calcifications have a characteristic periventricular distribution and may be detected by ultrasonography or CT scan. The diagnosis is confirmed with viral culture or polymerase chain amplification from urine or blood within the first week of life. Treatment is with antiviral agents such as ganciclovir or valganciclovir.",

Myocardial infarction can present nonspecifically but classically occurs with shortness of breath, chest pain, light-headedness, nausea, vomiting, or altered mental status, and may be complicated by cardiogenic shock, seen as tachycardia, hypotension, and impaired end-organ perfusion (cool extremities, low urine output). In postoperative cases, especially with intubated patients, it may be difficult to assess the presence of myocardial infarction. Evaluation using ECG, serial troponin assays, and echocardiogram should be considered in such cases. Right-heart catheterization can be used to determine cardiac output and index, along with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which can distinguish right heart failure from left heart failure. An increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure indicates that filling pressures in the left heart are abnormal, which is consistent with myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Bacterial overgrowth results from abnormal growth of bacteria in the small intestine, which disrupts normal digestion of macromolecules. Patients present with recurrent nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, weight loss, loose stools, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Bacterial overgrowth classically occurs in patients with previous history of abdominal surgeries, resection of the ileocecal valve, creation of blind loops, or following prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors. This is caused by the loss of normal intestinal peristalsis, retrograde translocation, or disruption of acidic pH as means of limiting bacterial presence or promoting bacterial elimination in the small bowel. The increased metabolism from bacteria, their colonization of the bowel wall, and disruption of normal gut flora contribute to malabsorption and resultant symptoms. Bacterial overgrowth occurs more frequently in patients with blind or limited-transit intestinal loops created during procedures such as the Billroth II or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, resulting from the loss of passing food bolus which allows for appropriate anterograde propulsion of bacteria along the gastrointestinal tract. Patients may see improvement in symptoms following administration of antibiotics, which decreases bacterial burden.",

Neither bile reflux nor peptic ulcer disease are associated with loose stools and increased stool frequency. Dumping syndrome (Choice D) occurs because of rapid gastric emptying into the duodenum and often presents with abdominal pain and cramping. It would be unlikely to improve with the administration of antibiotics. Efferent loop obstruction (Choice E) refers to mechanical obstruction of the efferent jejunal limb of intestine following a gastric reconstruction procedure and presents with symptoms of small bowel obstruction, not increased stool frequency. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 3 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Pneumothorax results from air entering the intrapleural space from either an external (e.g., stab wound) or internal (e.g., ruptured bleb or bronchus, bronchopleural fistula) source. As the air accumulates within the space, the lung parenchyma becomes compressed, resulting in reduced breath sounds, respiratory distress, and, in severe cases, tension on the mediastinal structures impeding venous return. In cases of acute trauma, evacuating the accumulated air permits expansion of the lung and elimination of tension on the great vessels; this is done through needle decompression in cases of tension pneumothorax, tube thoracostomy, or both. Once a tube thoracostomy is placed and healing of the inciting injury occurs, leakage of air into the pleural space should stop. If a persistent air leak is noted, the source of the leak should be investigated. A ruptured bronchus requires extended time to heal and is one source of a potential air leak. If the leak persists, surgical correction of the rupture may be required to prevent chronic pneumothorax from a resultant bronchopleural fistula. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, and D. Esophageal injury (Choice A) can result in pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax, and, if severe, bacterial mediastinitis can occur. While diminished breath sounds may occur in the setting of an esophageal injury, additional findings such as mediastinal crepitus, crunching on auscultation, and signs of sepsis would likely be present. Open pneumothorax (Choice B) would be detected on examination as a penetrating wound in continuity with the pleural space. Tension pneumothorax (Choice D) occurs when air accumulates within the pleural cavity to an extent that results in compression and shifting of the mediastinal structures. Such structural compromise results in impaired venous return leading to diminished cardiac output. It typically presents as severe respiratory distress, jugular venous distention, tracheal deviation, diminished breath sounds, hyperresonance to percussion, and hemithorax hyperinflation. Vital signs will show tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 4 of 50 'I",

        "A": "Adrenal insufficiency refers to insufficient production of hormones from the adrenal cortex, which include aldosterone and cortisol; sex hormone deficiency may also be present. Primary adrenal insufficiency can present with deficiencies in both aldosterone and cortisol, whereas secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency tends to affect cortisol concentrations only. Insufficient aldosterone production leads to hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Insufficient cortisol can lead to hypoglycemia, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, and lethargy. Adrenal insufficiency would not present with increased serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations. Cushing syndrome (Choice B) results from increased endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoid activity and presents with fatigue, hypertension, hyperglycemia, fat redistribution (moon facies, buffalo hump, truncal obesity, extremity wasting), and abdominal striae. Exogenous production of insulin-like growth factor (Choice C) results in gigantism or acromegaly depending on whether the production of the hormone occurs prior to or following closure of growth plates; it presents in an adult with enlargement of flat bones, notably in the face, hands, and feet, and is often associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It would not classically present with hypoglycemia. Pituitary insufficiency (Choice E) presents with a variety of symptoms depending on which hormones are deficient and generally refers to deficiency of the anterior pituitary hormones. Hypopituitarism carries a complex presentation, though symptoms of hypoglycemia can result from secondary adrenal insufficiency resulting from inadequate adrenocorticotropic hormone production. However, symptoms of hypoglycemia from adrenal insufficiency would not always follow activity or fasting, and concentrations of insulin would be low or normal. Reactive hypoglycemia (Choice F) refers to blood glucose fluctuations, specifically hyperglycemia followed by hypoglycemia, following a high carbohydrate meal. Symptoms of hypoglycemia occur typically two to four hours following a large meal and are thought to occur from the rapid decrease in blood glucose during insulin-triggered uptake by cells. Surreptitious self-administration of insulin (Choice G), also known as factitious hypoglycemia, presents with low serum C-peptide, as the hyperinsulinemic state is secondary to exogenous administration, not r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 4 of 50 tall and weighs 77 kg (170 lb); BMI is 23 kg/m 2 His pulse is 60/min , and blood pressure is 105/60 mm Hg. Examination shows no other abnormalities . He is given a meal and then given nothing orally. Seven hours later when he • develops similar symptoms , his serum glucose concentration is 25 mg/dl , and serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations are increased . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Adrenal insufficiency B) Cushing syndrome C) Exogenous production of insulin-like growth factor D) lnsulinoma E) Pituitary insufficiency F) Reactive hypoglycemia G) Surreptitious self-administration of insulin H) Type 1 diabetes mellitus CorrectAnswer: D. lnsulinoma is a rare neoplasm of pancreatic islet cells that functionally produces insulin. These neoplastic cells classically do not respond to the typical feedback mechanisms, and as a result, insulin is continuously produced even in periods of hypoglycemia. Patients present with symptoms of hypoglycemia which are generally neuroglycopenic (agitation, headache, blurry vision, diplopia, tremor), autonomic (diaphoresis, tremor, nausea, vomiting, cramping, tachycardia, anxiety), and nonspecific (fatigue, weakness, lethargy), often exacerbated by periods of fasting or exercise. In extreme cases, hypoglycemia can present with seizures, coma, arrhythmias, and death. Whipple triad characterizes the presentation of true hypoglycemia and includes 1) signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, 2) concomitant serum glucose less than 45 mg/dl, and 3) reversibility of symptoms with administration of glucose. lnsulinomas seldom metastasize and are considered predominantly benign neuroendocrine tumors apart from their dysregulated functional production of hormone. They are occasionally associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia. Diagnosis of an insulinoma is via laboratory evaluation demonstrating increased serum proinsulin, insulin, C-peptide, and decreased glucose, and imaging of the pancreas with CT scan or MRI. Definitive treatment is surgical resection. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, E, F, G, and H.

Benign causes without anatomic abnormality include cyclic hormonal fluctuations related to the menstrual cycle, occult trauma, the use of oral contraceptive pills, exogenous hormones, and antipsychotics. Fibrocystic breast disease is a benign and cyclic cause of breast pain that presents with focal masses or nodules. Noncyclic mastalgia can arise from malignancy or infection, both of which present with positive examination findings. Provided that no focal findings are present on examination, symptoms are improving, the patient is reliable and with no risk factors, and the low likelihood of confounding diagnoses (e.g., pneumothorax, pneumonia, acute coronary syndrome), reassurance and watchful waiting is appropriate. If a mass is palpated, the patient is above age 40 to 50 years, or if there are secondary or concerning features in the history for malignancy or infection, breast imaging should be obtained.",

Antibiotic therapy (Choice D) would be appropriate for a patient with a breast abscess or mastitis, which would present with erythema, tenderness, fluctuance, and systemic signs of infection (e.g., fever, chills, myalgias, arthralgias, nausea). Biopsy of the tender area (Choice E) is appropriate for lesions concerning for malignancy; the procedure is invasive and reserved for cases of moderate to high clinical suspicion after investigation with diagnostic imaging takes place (e.g., mammography, ultrasonography, MRI). r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 6 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Crohn disease is characterized by transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, most frequently involving the terminal ileum. It can arise anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract and is a subclass of inflammatory bowel disease. Most patients experience chronic abdominal cramping, bloody diarrhea, and weight loss. Examination often demonstrates generalized abdominal tenderness, sometimes worse in the right lower quadrant, and depending on the severity and extent, may disclose complications such as enterocutaneous fistulas and extraintestinal manifestations such as uveitis. Severe Crohn disease can result in intestinal obstruction from stricture or inflammation, bowel perforation, intra-abdominal abscess, and the formation of additional fistulas. Diagnosis occurs through imaging and biopsy. Laboratory analyses often show increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. On fluoroscopic small bowel follow-through, narrowing of the intestinal lumen at the terminal ileum is commonly seen, along with other sites of strictures or fistulous formation. Treatment is through anti-inflammatory medications, immunomodulators, and glucocorticoids, with complicated, severe cases sometimes requiring surgery such as small bowel resection or colectomy. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Amebic enteritis {Choice A) presents with crampy abdominal pain, watery or bloody diarrhea, and abdominal distention. When severe or complicated, hepatitis, hepatic abscesses, intestinal ulceration, or perforation may occur. Exposure occurs from ingestion of contaminated water containing cysts of the amoeba (typically Entamoeba histolytica) often in areas with poor sanitation or insecure water supply. Leiomyosarcoma {Choice C) is a rare malignancy of smooth muscle that most commonly occurs in the abdomen or uterus; lesions do not typically present with intermittent diarrhea and are generally not associated with regional enteritis. Necrotizing enterocolitis {Choice D) is classically associated with premature infancy and is characterized by inflammation and necrosis of the bowel wall. It is treated with intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest, and if complicated by perforation, may require surgical resection. It is rare in adults. Recurrent intussusception {Choice E) describes telescoping of one segment of bowel into another, which can cause intestinal ischemia or obstruction. It is typically because of a pathologic lead point (e.g., malignancy, stricture, lymphadenopathy), and presents with colicky pain and bloating. It more commonly presents in children. The small bowel follow-through examination does not demonstrate telescoping of bowel segments. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 9 of 50 'I",

Head trauma, the use of anticoagulants, abuse, alcohol use disorder, cerebral atrophy, and malignancy are associated with the risk for developing a subdural hematoma (SDH). On imaging, SDH appears as a crescent-shaped fluid collection abutting the internal surface of the skull, not bound by suture lines.

Untreated, the SDH presents the risk for continuing to grow in size, which can result in herniation of central nervous system structures if large enough. When such mass effect is present or at risk for developing, a burr hole or craniotomy is indicated to evacuate the hematoma. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Anticonvulsant therapy (Choice A) has an adjunct role in the management of intracranial bleeding to prevent seizures; however, this is not as critical as decompressive procedures for appropriate subdural hematoma evacuation. Benzodiazepine therapy (Choice B) has a role in the treatment of seizures and in managing alcohol withdrawal. This patient presents with a subdural hematoma, stable vital signs, and no clear evidence of agitation or withdrawal. Intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy (Choice C) does not have a commonly recognized role in the treatment of subdural hematoma, although magnesium is often deficient in patients with alcohol use disorder and repletion may be required, especially in cases of concomitantly low potassium. Lumbar puncture (Choice D) is contraindicated in the setting of an intracranial mass lesion because of the associated increased intracranial pressure and theoretical risk for cerebellar tonsillar herniation. r \" , r-- r , 'I 11 . Six hours after sigmoid colectomy and colostomy for perforated diverticulitis , a 62-year-old woman has had a total postoperative urine output of 65 ml through a Foley catheter. Preoperatively , the patient had a serum urea nitrogen concentration of 45 mg/dl and a serum creatinine concentration of 2 mg/dl. She has been receiving 0.45% saline at 90 ml/h since the operation . She is 157 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 60 kg (132 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m 2 Her pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. Her serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference range , and urine specific gravity is 1.028. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Measurement of creatinine clearance B) Intravenous pyelography C) Renal perfusion scan D) Rapid administration of 500 ml of 0.9% saline E) Administration of intravenous fluids to replace insensible fluid losses only F) Administration of intravenous fluids to replace urine output only CorrectAnswer: D. Physiologically, one of the first detectable aspects of hypovolemic shock is declining urine output. As a result of normal compensatory mechanisms, the kidney begins to retain fluid when intravascular volume falls. This occurs through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which causes retention of sodium and water, along with the increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) when volume losses are excessive. Retention of fluid permits maintenance of hemodynamics until such losses result in insufficient compensation, which in early shock states permits the heart rate, blood pressure, and signs of perfusion (e.g., capillary refill, pulse pressure) to remain normal. Appropriate urine output levels in homeostatic euvolemia are generally 0.5 to 1.0 ml/kg/hour. An adult patient of average body mass should excrete 35 to 70 ml/hour when euvolemic. A total of 65 ml of urine output, six hours after a surgery in which fluid and blood losses and third spacing likely occurred, suggests a clinically significant hypovolemia. The best initial treatment is replacement of volume using 0.9% saline. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, E, and F. Measurement of creatinine clearance {Choice A) would not assist in the immediate resuscitation of this patient, who has an objective physiologic parameter (urine output) indicating early compensated shock. Intravenous pyelography {Choice B) would be useful in the diagnosis of obstructive hydroureteronephrosis as a cause of low urine output. It is not the most likely cause in a patient presenting after surgery for an intraperitoneal pathology, as the ureters and kidneys are retroperitoneal structures. Renal perfusion scan {Choice C) is used to evaluate blood flow to the kidney; apart from unexpected surgical complication, it would not be the most likely cause of falling urine output in the postoperative state for an unrelated procedure. Administration of intravenous fluids to replace insensible fluid losses only {Choice E) and administration of intravenous fluids to replace urine output only {Choice F) would not sufficiently resuscitate the patient, as replacement of previous losses is required to compensate for the total volume deficit in addition to ongoing losses. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 12 of 50 'I"

    "explanation": {
      "correct_answer_explanation": "Ventilatory insufficiency arises because of derangement in the neurologic, metabolic, or motor drivers of respiration. Ventilation is a complex process driven by the somatic and autonomic nervous systems and requires an intact central nervous system without dysfunction of the brain stem, spinal cord, or efferent nerves (e.g., phrenic, intercostal). It also requires an unobstructed airway, unrestricted and semirigid chest wall, normal neuromuscular function, normal circulatory function , and normal pulmonary parenchymal and stromal function. Derangement within any part of this process can result in insufficient ventilation. Spinal anesthesia can reduce neuromuscular function distal to the level of the block. In turn, insufficient rate or depth of ventilation will result in retained carbon dioxide and development of acute respiratory acidosis. Acute respiratory acidosis typically demonstrates a decrease in pH with increased PCO on arterial blood gas. Hypoxia may be present. With cessation of neuromuscular blockade, respiratory mechanics should return to baseline, and result in 2 progressive resolution of the acid-base disturbance. In severe or complicated cases, ventilatory support may be required.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Fluid overload presents with symptoms of shortness of breath and weight gain, and on physical examination, patients may demonstrate tachypnea, tachycardia, hypertension, hypoxia, jugular venous distention, lower extremity edema, crackles in the lung fields, and an S heart sound . Fluid overload classically occurs in a patient with heart, liver, or renal failure. It would be unlikely to follow spinal anesthesia without 3 preceding symptoms and would generally exclude a patient from elective surgery. lntraoperative myocardial infarction (Choice B) is a known complication of many surgeries as a consequence of physiologic stress, blood loss, and the proinflammatory state of surgery; it presents with chest pain , shortness of breath , and specific T wave, ST-segment, or Q wave changes on ECG. However, if the patient is under general anesthesia, the diagnosis would depend on ECG changes. Metabolic acidosis (Choice C) is demonstrated on arterial blood gas analysis as low pH and low PCO along with low bicarbonate. It can present with or without an anion gap, which helps elucidate the cause of the 2 metabolic acidosis. Common causes include lactic acidosis, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and diarrhea. Total sympathetic blockade (Choice D) is a potential complication of anesthesia; however, it would be unlikely to cause hypoventilation at the thoracic level as blockade of the brain stem would be required. Additionally, total sympathetic blockade typically presents with hypotension, bradycardia, depressed respiratory drive, and miosis. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 13 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency are associated with chronic pancreatitis and result from repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis leading to the destruction of acinar and islet cells. The exocrine pancreas produces digestive enzymes, the absence of which leads to malnutrition (e.g., cachexia, muscle wasting), weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and frequent, loose, foul-smelling, sometimes oily stools (steatorrhea). The endocrine pancreas produces insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin. The loss of endogenous insulin leads to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, with symptoms including polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia. The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic insufficiency is through clinical history, imaging, and biopsy. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is treated with oral pancreatic enzyme replacement, and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus caused by the loss of pancreatic insulin requires insulin replacement.

Patients present with recurrent nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, weight loss, and malabsorption. Bacterial overgrowth classically occurs in patients with a previous history of abdominal surgeries, resection of the ileocecal valve, creation of blind loops, or following prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors. Celiac disease (Choice B), a gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an immunologic intolerance to the protein gliadin. Celiac disease typically presents with abdominal discomfort, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea following exposure to gluten and may be associated with weight loss and dermatitis herpetiformis. Cystic fibrosis (Choice C) is a hereditary chloride channelopathy that results in thickened bronchial and gastrointestinal mucous secretions, leading to chronic infection, inflammation, and malabsorption. It can result in pancreatic insufficiency, although this would be unlikely given the patient's risk factors for chronic pancreatitis and lack of concordant findings to suggest cystic fibrosis. Hemochromatosis (Choice D) presents with liver failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, arthritis, heart failure, darkening of the skin, and gonadal atrophy secondary to excess total body iron. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Choice F) is often asymptomatic but generally occurs in overweight, sedentary persons because of impaired insulin sensitivity. It is usually associated with weight gain and metabolic syndrome as a precursor condition.

They may exert mass effect on cranial nerves within their proximity or invade the nerves from which they arise, often the facial nerve, vestibulocochlear nerve, or adjacent nerves. Facial nerve involvement manifests as facial asymmetry caused by loss of skeletal muscle innervation, and occasionally presents with diminished taste perception involving the ipsilateral anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Vestibulocochlear nerve palsy can present with diminished hearing or tinnitus (cochlear branch) on the ipsilateral side, and vertigo or ataxia may occur (vestibular branch) because of impaired proprioception from loss of input from the ipsilateral vestibule.

Translocation of gastric contents into the mediastinum can cause rapidly progressive infection and sepsis from mediastinitis. If not appropriately treated with antibiotics and source control, mediastinitis can be fatal. Esophageal perforation is a surgical emergency and is diagnosed through water-soluble contrast esophagography. It is treated with surgical repair via exploratory thoracotomy, which allows mediastinal washout and repair of the defect.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Esophagoscopy is an alternative method of diagnosing a perforated esophagus via direct visualization, but because of insufflation and advancement of an endoscope through the esophagus, this method runs the risk for worsening the perforation. Exploratory celiotomy (laparotomy) (Choice B) may have a role if the esophageal perforation is inferior to the esophageal hiatus; however, the diagnostic testing performed on this patient discloses a proximal defect into the mediastinum. This would be better accessed for definitive repair with an exploratory thoracotomy. CT scan of the chest (Choice D) is a potential alternative diagnostic method if the patient is unable to participate in the swallowing necessary for an esophagography, but it is likely to miss small perforations and defects in the esophagus. Esophagography with a water-soluble contrast is much more sensitive and specific to evaluate an esophageal perforation. Tube thoracostomy (Choice E) is appropriate to diagnose and treat pleural effusions and pneumothoraces; however, it would not permit source control and repair in cases of esophageal rupture. This patient does exhibit a left-sided pleural effusion; however, it is secondary to the esophageal perforation, which should be diagnosed and treated first. A thoracostomy may have an adjunct role in preventing empyema from the resultant pleural effusion but is not the primary means of treatment for the esophageal perforation. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 19 of 50 'I"

MH classically occurs because of a mutation in the skeletal myocyte ryanodine receptor type 1; activation of this receptor permits rapid and uncontrolled calcium efflux from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, with resultant uncontrolled depolarization. A hypermetabolic state ensues with signs and symptoms including agitation, diaphoresis, hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, and muscle rigidity. Complications include hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis. MH is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and can present similarly to neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome. Treatment requires discontinuation of the offending agent and rapid administration of dantrolene, which prevents calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Renal artery stenosis is a cause of secondary hypertension related to abnormal stimulation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus from low afferent blood flow leading to excessive production of renin and angiotensin. The reduced afferent blood flow can also result in progressive renal atrophy. Secondary hypertension should be considered in new-onset or treatment-resistant hypertension, or in patients with predisposing features such as known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (e.g., coronary artery disease). There are two main causes of renal artery stenosis: fibromuscular dysplasia and atherosclerosis. In younger patients, fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause, while older patients develop renal artery stenosis more commonly from atherosclerosis. Diagnosis is established with renal artery Doppler ultrasonography or magnetic resonance angiography, which can quantify the degree of renal artery stenosis and renal atrophy. Treatment involves angioplasty or stenting of the stenosed renal artery to improve flow. ACE inhibitors can be considered for unilateral stenosis but can lead to acute kidney injury in the setting of bilateral renal artery stenosis.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Adenomyosis is the presence of glandular endometrial tissue in the myometrium, and generally presents with abnormal uterine bleeding and pelvic pain. It most commonly occurs in a multigravid woman, often in her fourth or fifth decade of life. On examination, a large, boggy uterus may be palpated. Corpus luteum cysts (Choice B) occur as a normal feature of the menstrual cycle; once a follicle matures and releases an ovum, the residual tissue becomes known as the corpus luteum, a structure that produces estrogen and progesterone in support of a potential conception. If fertilization and implantation does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates. In some cases, they can fill with fluid or blood, resulting in the formation of a cyst, which is typically visible on ultrasonography.",

The gold-standard for diagnosis is a diagnostic laparoscopy, which evaluates for endometriotic implant lesions on the peritoneum. Follicular cyst (Choice F) is the most common type of ovarian cyst and describes an unruptured follicle, or one that has ruptured but remains filled with simple fluid. They are generally asymptomatic when small but may result in pelvic pain or pressure when large. They do not carry any risk for ovarian neoplasm. Leiomyomata uteri (Choice G), also known as uterine fibroids, are benign neoplasms of uterine myometrium. They are a potential cause of abnormal uterine bleeding and pelvic pain and are typically visible on ultrasonography. They are the most common indication for hysterectomy. Pelvic inflammatory disease (Choice H) is a common risk factor for future ectopic pregnancy and presents with pelvic pain, cervicovaginal discharge, fever, and cervical motion, uterine, and/or adnexal tenderness secondary to bacterial infection. Common pathogens include enteric flora, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Ruptured ovarian cyst (Choice I) can present with severe abdominal pain and focal peritoneal signs; however, the cyst is typically visible on ultrasonography with surrounding simple fluid from the rupture. This is a less likely cause of the patient's presentation, as ruptured ovarian cysts do not typically result in hemorrhagic shock. Spontaneous abortion (Choice J) presents with vaginal bleeding, abdominal or pelvic pain, and an open or closed cervical os. While vaginal bleeding may be present, this does not typically result in hemorrhagic shock, which makes an ectopic pregnancy more likely to explain this patient's presentation. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 22 of 50 'I"

Damage to the roots or to the nerve along its course (e.g., in the cubital tunnel) can result in motor dysfunction of the fingers and numbness or paresthesia involving the medial aspect of the upper extremity. Injury occurring at the CB root often occurs from cervical stenosis, foraminal impingement from a disc-osteophyte complex, loss of disc-height from degenerative disc disease, trauma, malignancy, spinal epidural abscess, or spinal hematoma.",

This results in increased glomerular pressure, glomerular hyperfiltration injury, expansion of the mesangium, thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, and glomerular sclerosis. Laboratory evaluation typically discloses albuminuria, not hematuria. Goodpasture syndrome (Choice B) is a type 2 hypersensitivity reaction that results in autoimmune antibody targeting of the pulmonary capillaries and glomerular basement membranes, leading to hemoptysis and hematuria. Lupus nephritis (Choice C) is a complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is common in younger women; it presents with hematuria and rising creatinine in the setting of SLE. Laboratory evaluation generally discloses a low complement concentration. Polyarteritis nodosa (Choice D) is a necrotizing vasculitis that involves medium-sized arteries and generally affects the kidneys and visceral organs, sparing the lungs. It does not generally present with hypercalcemia and fever. Polycystic kidney disease (Choice E) is caused by genetic mutations that result in the development of multiple cysts in the kidney because of structural abnormalities of the renal tubules. Cysts may form in infancy, childhood, or adulthood, and eventually compress adjacent normal renal parenchyma. Aneurysmal vascular disease and hepatic cysts are often also present in the autosomal dominant form of polycystic kidney disease. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (Choice F) is a type of nephritic syndrome characterized by dark-colored urine, hypertension, and proteinuria following an infection with group A streptococcus. Urinary tract infection (Choice H) generally presents with suprapubic pain, dysuria, and increased urinary frequency and urgency, most commonly occurring in women. Wegener granulomatosis (Choice I) is a necrotizing vasculitis that classically presents with sinopulmonary and renal vessel involvement.

Mitral stenosis occurs because of calcification and fibrosis of the mitral valve. Impaired excursion of the valve leaflets results in increased left atrial filling pressures and impaired diastolic filling of the left ventricle. The resulting elevation in left atrial pressure can result in left atrial enlargement and potential pulmonary edema. The fixed obstruction to blood flow may manifest with signs of heart failure such as shortness of breath, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and impaired exercise tolerance. Chronic rheumatic disease is a key risk factor for the development of the condition. Treatment is through medical optimization followed by surgical valve replacement if severe.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Aortic regurgitation presents with an early diastolic decrescendo murmur heard best in the right second intercostal space, and is most commonly associated with endocarditis, acute rheumatic fever, and aortic root dilation. Aortic stenosis (Choice B) presents with a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur that is heard best at the upper right sternal border and radiates to the carotid arteries. It classically occurs secondary to age-related fibrotic and calcific changes of the valve but can occur earlier in life in cases of bicuspid aortic valve or chronic rheumatic disease. Atrial septal defect (Choice C) is a defect in the interatrial septum. The most common type is an ostium secundum defect, although ostium primum defects are commonly associated with trisomy 21. The atrial septal defect results in a left-to-right shunt with abnormal flow of blood from the left atrium to the right atrium, resulting in relative volume overload of the right atrium and ventricle, which presents as a fixed, split S and low 2 grade physiologic ejection murmur on cardiac auscultation. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (Choice D) classically presents with a systolic murmur loudest in the lower left sternal border, which is quieter with increased preload and afterload. It is secondary to hypertrophy of the interventricular septum, creating an outflow obstruction within the left ventricular outflow tract. It classically presents with syncope or sudden cardiac death in an exercising young athlete with a potential family history of a similar event. Mitral regurgitation (Choice E) presents with a holosystolic murmur that is heard best in the left fourth or fifth intercostal space along the midclavicular line and radiates to the left axilla. It is commonly associated with mitral valve prolapse or prior myocardial infarction. Pulmonic stenosis (Choice G) presents with a systolic murmur heard best in the second left intercostal region, which is also often crescendo-decrescendo, though quieter and with less radiation to the lower neck because of the lower pressure in the pulmonary circulation. Ventricular septal defect (Choice H) is characterized by a holosystolic murmur heard best in the lower left sternal border. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 28 of 50 'I"

Diverticulitis presents with acute left lower quadrant abdominal pain, sometimes accompanied by diarrhea, fever, and tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant. An inguinal mass would not be expected. Femoral artery aneurysm (Choice B) is an abnormal dilatation of the femoral artery, which is located in the thigh distal to the inguinal ligament. On examination, a pulsatile mass may be palpable. It would not classically present with fever and leukocytosis. Inguinal lymphadenitis (Choice C) occurs in the setting of infection, inflammation, or malignancy within the lymph nodes and associated tissues along the involved site's drainage pattern. It can be seen in the setting of sexually transmitted infection accompanied by genital lesions. It would seldom cause unstable vital signs, and lymph nodes are often discretely palpable. Testicular torsion (Choice E) occurs when the testicle rotates about itself within the scrotal sac. The resultant twisting of the spermatic cord, which contains the gonadal artery, pampiniform plexus, and gonadal vein results in vascular congestion and potential cessation of venous or arterial flow. This can lead to testicular infarction if not promptly managed. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 29 of 50 'I"

        "A": "Gastric mucosal irritation due to an enterovirus infection describes viral gastritis, a common cause of epigastric and left upper quadrant discomfort, nausea, and vomiting, that is generally self-limited. Symptoms of a gastric outlet obstruction would not be expected. Mucosal action of ingested heat-stable enterotoxins (Choice B) describes the mechanism of traveler's diarrhea because of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Heat stable toxin from ETEC binds guanylate cyclase, resulting in downstream effects of electrolyte and water loss from the mucosal cells. Patients typically experience nausea, cramping, abdominal bloating, and profuse, watery diarrhea. Perforation of a duodenal diverticulum (Choice C) may lead to severe, diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, high fever, tachycardia, and septic shock. Bowel contents in the peritoneal space cause rapid infection in the form of peritonitis marked by abdominal rigidity, rebound tenderness, and guarding; perforated viscus and resultant peritonitis is a surgical emergency requiring exploratory laparotomy. Thrombosis of the superior mesenteric artery (Choice E) describes the pathophysiology of acute mesenteric ischemia, which presents with acute, severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea, often in a patient with atrial fibrillation, splanchnic atherosclerosis, or a hypercoagulable state. Acute mesenteric ischemia is life-threatening because of complications of bowel necrosis including sepsis, peritonitis, and perforation. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 31 of 50 'I 31 . A 46-year-old woman with immune thrombocytopenic purpura has been treated with prednisone (100 mg daily) and immune globulin for 6 weeks without relief . Her platelet count is 20,000/mm 3 Bleeding time is prolonged , clot retraction is poor, and platelet life span is shortened . A bone marrow biopsy specimen shows a near-normal level of megakaryocytes . Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Aspirin therapy B) Increase prednisone to 200 mg daily C) Doxorubicin therapy D) Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor therapy E) S!Jlenectomy Correct Answer: E. Refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) following treatment with corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is treated with splenectomy. ITP is diagnosed in the setting of a low platelet count with normal bone marrow and an absence of other explanatory causes for thrombocytopenia. It classically presents with petechiae and purpura, and prolonged bleeding time on laboratory analysis. Severe ITP may lead to uncontrolled hemorrhage. Acute ITP often follows an infection and generally is self-limited. Chronic ITP is first treated with corticosteroids which may be required long-term, IVIG, or immunomodulators. Refractory ITP that is non responsive to such therapies is treated with splenectomy, which results in remission of thrombocytopenia in the majority of cases because of the spleen's primary role in the underlying pathophysiology. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Aspirin therapy (Choice A) would worsen this patient's bleeding time by irreversibly inhibiting platelet activation, leading to a further increased risk for abnormal bleeding. Increase prednisone to 200 mg daily (Choice B) would be futile, as the patient is already on a maximal dose of prednisone; any additional dose would only likely worsen adverse effects (e.g., Cushing syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, psychosis) without additional therapeutic benefit. Doxorubicin therapy (Choice C) is not a commonly employed therapy for ITP, as it suppresses bone marrow production, which may further lower the patient's platelet count. There have been case reports of its use, but it is not widely accepted. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) therapy (Choice D) is appropriate therapy for patients with leukopenia but does not have a recognized role in treating refractory thrombocytopenia; in fact, levels of GM-CSF have been shown to be increased in patients with ITP. By comparison, romiplostim and eltrombopag are stimulators of thrombopoiesis that have an adjunct role in the treatment of ITP. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 32 of 50 'I"

Autonomy posits that patients have the right to make their decisions if they have the capacity to do so, and that they have been provided with appropriate information for use in making such a decision. A consenting adult, with decision-making capacity, has the right to refuse some or all aspects of medical care, even if such a decision may result in short- or long-term morbidity or mortality. In this case, Jehovah's witnesses often refuse blood products. Provided that this patient has capacity and that an appropriate consent form has been provided by the treating physician explaining the benefits, risks, and alternatives of receiving or not receiving blood products, the patient may elect to refuse. Prolonged cardiac arrest because of ventricular fibrillation results in impaired perfusion of end-organs, with common short- and long-term sequelae including hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and renal or intestinal ischemia and infarction. This patient presents following cardiac arrest with abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis, with signs of peritonitis. Despite anemia, an emergent exploratory laparotomy to evaluate the bowel is indicated, along with intravenous fluids, antipyretics, and antibiotics.",

Administration of erythropoietin, intravenously (Choice B) and administration of iron, intramuscularly (Choice C) may be appropriate for this patient; however, the time to see an effect from administration of erythropoietin or iron (both via hematopoiesis) is days to weeks, offering no immediate benefit in the emergent setting. Transfusion of packed red blood cells (Choice D) violates the patient's expressly stated preference for her healthcare and should not be performed, as this would breach the patient's autonomy. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 33 of 50 'I"

Hypovolemia should be evident from the patient's risk factors, clinical history, and on physical examination, which may demonstrate dry mucous membranes, skin tenting, cool extremities, weak peripheral pulses, tachycardia, or hypotension. Inappropriate secretion of ADH (vasopressin) (Choice B) often occurs following injury involving the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, or because of ectopic secretion in cases of paraneoplastic syndrome. It presents with euvolemic hypo-osmolar hyponatremia and generally has no effect on the creatinine concentration. Increased production of angiotensin II (Choice C) occurs because of activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Such activation may be appropriate, in cases of hypovolemia or hypotension, or inappropriate, in cases of renal artery stenosis or a reninoma.

Atrial septal defect (Choice B) is a defect in the interatrial septum. The most common type is an ostium secundum defect, although ostium primum defects are commonly associated with trisomy 21. The atrial septal defect results in a left-to-right shunt with abnormal flow of blood from the left atrium to the right atrium, resulting in relative volume overload of the right atrium and ventricle, which presents as a fixed, split S and low 2 grade physiologic ejection murmur on cardiac auscultation. Coarctation of the aorta (Choice C) refers to a narrowing of the aorta. It is associated with a bicuspid aortic valve and Turner syndrome. It typically presents with a systolic murmur with differential pulses and blood pressures between extremities. Pulmonary stenosis (Choice E) presents with a systolic murmur best heard in the left second intercostal region, which is often crescendo-decrescendo in nature, though generally quieter and with less radiation to the neck compared to aortic stenosis because of the lower pressure in the pulmonary circulation. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 36 of 50 'I"

        "A": "ABO incompatibility occurs because of a mismatch between donor and recipient blood groups where the native recipient immunoglobulins against the donor antigen (known as an acute, hemolytic transfusion reaction [AHTR]). AHTR can be life threatening because of hemolysis, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and hypotension. Diagnosis is based on the history and laboratory workup for hemolysis plus blood group mismatch; treatment begins with immediate discontinuation of the transfusion. Bacterial growth in transfused blood (transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection [TTBI]) (Choice B) is a source of bacteremia following transfusion and can occur when bacteria is introduced at any point from the collection process to the transfusion. Symptoms include fever, rigors, tachycardia, and tachypnea, and can occur anywhere from minutes to hours after transfusion. TTBI is rare with current standards for the proper handling of blood products. Intravenous catheter infection (Choice C) is uncommon with appropriate technique and antiseptic conditions related to peripheral intravenous catheters and would take hours to days to develop. Rh incompatibility (Choice E) is primarily of concern to pregnant women who are Rh-antigen negative; exposure to the Rh antigen can result in immunoglobulin formation and risk for subsequent fetal hemolysis in future pregnancies if the fetus is Rh-positive. Rh incompatibility in males is of minimal clinical significance and does not commonly cause hemolysis following a transfusion. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 37 of 50 'I"

        "A": "Angiodysplasia of the colon and arteriovenous malformation of the colon (Choice C) present with lower gastrointestinal bleeding and are often otherwise asymptomatic. They classically occur in the elderly and persons with a history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The terms are often used synonymously, though classically angiodysplasia refers to disordered growth of a blood vessel, whereas arteriovenous malformation suggests an abnormal vascular tangle involving both arteries and veins. Antibiotic-associated colitis (Choice B) refers to inflammation or infection of the colon, typically presenting as watery or bloody diarrhea, following the administration of antibiotics. The disruption of the normal intestinal microbiota from antibiotics may permit an opportunistic pathogen to infect or invade. Classically, this infection is associated with C/ostridioides difficile (formerly C/ostridium difficile); however, other pathogens, including Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Candida species have been implicated. C. difficile infections can present with pseudomembranous colitis (Choice F); on colonoscopy, yellow pseudomembranes are visualized amidst inflamed, ulcerated colonic mucosa.",
        "D": "Diverticulitis presents because of infection or inflammation of existing colonic diverticula, which are small outpouchings of the bowel wall, often located in the sigmoid colon. Diverticulitis presents with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, sometimes accompanied by diarrhea, fever, and tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant. lschemic colitis (Choice E) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or bloody diarrhea, often following a local obstruction to blood flow such as a mesenteric thrombus or embolus, or in a watershed territory in the setting of systemic hypotension. Laboratory investigation often discloses increased serum lactate and leukocytosis, and imaging may disclose bowel wall thickening, pneumatosis intestinalis, or perforation. Rectal carcinoid (Choice G) tumors are neuroendocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal tract but seldom present with the classic neuroendocrine features of flushing and diarrhea; rather, they often present with rectal bleeding, unexplained weight loss, and rectal pain. Volvulus of the colon (Choice I) most commonly refers to a sigmoid volvulus. It is defined as twisting of the colonic mesentery, with the sigmoid and cecum being the most commonly affected segments. Sigmoid volvulus generally presents in an older person, with increasing abdominal distention, abdominal pain, constipation, and possible obstipation. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 38 of 50 'I 38 . A 32-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 10-hour history of increasingly severe , constant pain in her abdomen . She has nausea but has not vomited. She has systemic lupus erythematosus well controlled with prednisone . She takes no other medications . Her temperature is 38°C (100.4 °F), pulse is 110/min , respirations are 16/min , and blood pressure is 115/65 mm Hg. Examination shows no scleral icterus . The abdomen is soft and tender to palpation over the right upper quadrant ; there is mild guarding without rebound . Laboratory studies show : Hemoglobin 14 g/dL Leukocyte count 12,000/mm 3 Segmented neutrophils 75% Bands 10% Lymphocytes 15% Results of liver function tests are within the reference ranges . Abdominal ultrasonography shows a distended gallbladder with a thickened wall and a gallstone lodged in the neck of the gallbladder . Following administration of cefazolin and an intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer solution , the patient is taken to the operating room for laparoscopic cholecystectomy . On induction with propofol , her blood pressure abruptly decreases to 60/40 mm Hg and remains constant despite administration of an additional 500-mL bolus of lactated Ringer solution . Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy? A) Administer diphenhydramine B) Administer dopamine C) Administer gentamicin D) Administer hydrocortisone E) Decrease the dose of propofol CorrectAnswer: D. The adrenal cortex primarily produces the hormones aldosterone, cortisol, and androstenedione. Aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, is regulated by the renin-angiotensin system and acts at the kidney to increase sodium uptake and promote excretion of potassium and hydrogen ions. Cortisol, a glucocorticoid, has roles in regulation of cardiovascular tone, carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism, and sympathetic nervous system function. Chronic use of prednisone, an exogenous glucocorticoid, results in negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with resultant downregulation of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). Without ACTH, adrenal cortical atrophy occurs. During physiologic stress such as surgery or infection, the atrophic adrenal parenchyma may not produce sufficient cortisol or aldosterone to meet physiologic demands for maintenance of vascular volume, cardiovascular and sympathetic tone, regulation of electrolytes, and regulation of blood glucose. This is known as an adrenal crisis (Addisonian crisis) characterized by hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation, hypoglycemia, hyperkalemia, and lethargy. Treatment is through repletion of the deficient hormones. Exogenous administration of hydrocortisone, which has both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid activity, is the treatment of choice. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Administer diphenhydramine (Choice A), an antihistamine and anticholinergic, would be appropriate for the treatment of an allergic or anaphylactic reaction, which classically presents with flushing, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bronchospasm, angioedema, and hypotension if shock is present. Administer dopamine (Choice B), a vasopressor and inotrope, may be appropriate in cases of cardiogenic shock. Administer gentamicin (Choice C) is appropriate in cases of septic shock, which typically presents with progressive tachycardia, fever, and hypotension in the setting of severe localized or disseminated infection. Decrease the dose of propofol (Choice E) may be appropriate; however, propofol-induced hypotension typically responds to fluids. Further, it is often self-limited by the patient's endogenous autonomic autoregulation, which is insufficient in cases of adrenal crisis. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 39 of 50 'I"

Gastritis commonly occurs from alcohol abuse, excess use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and smoking. Other causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding include esophagitis, esophageal varices, peptic ulcer disease, and arteriovenous malformations. Regardless of the cause of bleeding, any patient presenting with tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, and signs of hemorrhagic shock should receive immediate intravenous volume resuscitation, typically with isotonic crystalloids such as normal saline.",

A 3-week-old female newborn is brought to the physician because of an 18-day history of increasingly yellow skin and eyes. She was born at term to a 24-year-old woman , gravida 2, para 2, following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery ; her weight at birth was 3175 g (7 lb). She is exclusively breast-fed . Today, she weighs 3345 g (7 lb 6 oz). Physical examination shows scleral icterus and generalized jaundice . The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities . Her serum total bilirubin concentration is 15 mg/dl with a direct component of 13 mg/dl . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis ? A) ABO incompatibility B) Biliary atresia C) Breast milk jaundice D) Gilbert syndrome E) Hereditary spherocytosis F) Physiologic jaundice Correct Answer: B. In contrast to benign causes of neonatal jaundice, biliary atresia presents with progressively worsening jaundice (conjugated hyperbilirubinemia), pale stools, dark urine, poor weight gain, and, in untreated cases, cirrhosis, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension. Classically, benign causes of neonatal jaundice will improve by the second to third week of life, whereas biliary atresia will persist and often worsen within the first eight weeks of life. There are genetic causes of biliary atresia related to deficient glutathione transferase enzymes, and acquired causes (e.g., infection, exposure to aflatoxin), though often the cause is idiopathic. Diagnosis consists of history and physical examination, liver function testing, HIDA scan, or cholangiography, with definitive diagnosis occurring during exploratory surgery with visualization of atretic bile ducts. Treatment is through hepatoportoenterostomy (Kasai procedure), which restores biliary flow, reduces jaundice, and helps salvage the native liver function. Liver transplant may be required if the procedure is unsuccessful. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, E, and F. ABO incompatibility (Choice A) and hereditary spherocytosis (Choice E) result in indirect hyperbilirubinemia because of the release of heme into the bloodstream during red blood cell lysis. Breast milk jaundice (Choice C) occurs in breast-fed infants and is generally benign. It is typically a self-limited cause of neonatal jaundice. Infants will generally appear healthy and gain weight appropriately; occasionally in rare or severe cases, treatment may be required to prevent complications. Gilbert syndrome (Choice D) is a hereditary cause of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia resulting from diminished activity of uridine glucuronosyltransferase. Patients generally present with mild jaundice during periods of physiologic stress. In most cases, the condition is harmless. Physiologic jaundice (Choice F) is an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurring in neonates. It is characterized by jaundice appearing around the first week of life, with slowly increasing bilirubin concentrations that decline to adult levels by the end of the third week of life. Levels generally do not exceed 12 to 18 mg/dl. Mild cases are usually self-limiting without complication. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 42 of 50 'I 42 .

He has multiple facial lacerations . Which of the following imaging studies is best used to screen for cervical trauma? A) CTscan B) Lateral x-ray C) MRI D) Myelography E) Tomography Correct Answer: B. In patients without features concerning for cervical spine injury (absence of midline pain, neurologic deficits, distracting injury, intoxication, altered level of consciousness, or a high energy mechanism of injury) and in whom the pretest probability of a cervical spine injury is low (young, healthy, low energy mechanism of injury, no history of fragility fractures, and unremarkable examination), a lateral cervical spine x-ray can serve as a sufficiently sensitive screening test. Several decision rules have been developed to support the need for imaging in evaluating the cervical spine, including the NEXUS and Canadian C-spine rules. These rules are sensitive, not specific, meaning that they are used to rule out injury in a patient with low pretest probability. In any patient with moderate to high clinical suspicion of injury, a CT scan or MRI of the cervical spine should be obtained for more definitive evaluation. In pediatric trauma, x-ray imaging remains the modality of choice because of lower radiation exposure, generally low pretest probability, and reasonable sensitivity and specificity. lncorrectAnswer:A, C, D, and E. CT scan (Choice A) and MRI (Choice C) are appropriate noninvasive studies for investigation of cervical spine injuries when the clinician is unable to reasonably exclude them using lower radiation, lower cost, and less time-intensive techniques. If a patient exhibits moderate to high pretest probability of a cervical spine injury, or exhibits symptoms such as midline pain, neurologic deficits, distracting injury, intoxication, or an altered level of consciousness, a CT scan or MRI of the cervical spine should be obtained.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Penetrating trauma to the thigh with absent pulses distal to the wound suggests arterial injury and warrants immediate surgical exploration and repair to prevent ischemic injury to the limb or exsanguination. Signs of arterial injury include visualized pulsatile bleeding, rapidly expanding hematoma, asymmetric or absent pulses in the extremity, auscultated bruits, and diminished ankle-brachia! indices. Tachycardia, narrow pulse pressure, or hypotension may indicate the development of hemorrhagic shock. The diagnosis of an arterial injury is clinical when the physical examination demonstrates arterial bleeding and absent pulses. In cases of uncertainty, when the patient is hemodynamically stable, a CT angiography can be obtained for the visualization of vessel discontinuity or injury and for the assessment of active bleeding.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Cardiomyopathy presents with signs and symptoms of heart failure with either preserved or reduced ejection fraction. These include dyspnea on exertion, reduced exercise tolerance, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, shortness of breath, fatigue, weight gain, and peripheral edema. Physical examination often discloses jugular venous distention, peripheral edema, and an S or S gallop. 3 4",
        "B": "Hemothorax results from blood accumulating within the pleural space, often from trauma to the pulmonary, bronchial, or intercostal vessels in the setting of rib fractures or penetrating trauma. It presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, dullness to percussion, and diminished breath sounds on the affected side. If massive, hemodynamic instability may occur. Open pneumothorax (Choice C) presents following a thoracic wound or fistula in continuity with the pleural space. On examination, a bubbling chest wound may be noted with ipsilateral hyperresonance to percussion and diminished breath sounds. If the pneumothorax is under tension (Choice E), jugular venous distention, tracheal deviation, tachycardia, and hypotension may be present. Traumatic diaphragmatic hernia (Choice F) leads to the presence of abdominal contents within the thorax and presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and bowel sounds within the lung fields. It most commonly occurs in the left hemithorax and may be visualized as intestinal loops on x-rays. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 46 of 50 46 . A previously healthy 62-year-old man comes to the physician 2 days after an episode of blindness in the right eye that lasted 5 to 10 minutes . He has no history of similar episodes or other neurologic symptoms . He has type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent. His pulse is 75/min , respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. Examination shows intact motor and sensory function . The visual fields are full to confrontation . Results of funduscopic examination are shown . Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings? A) Cardiomyopathy B) Carotid stenosis C) Cataract D) Diabetic retinopathy E) Glaucoma Correct Answer: B. Amaurosis fugax describes sudden, painless monocular vision loss that begins abruptly and often resolves quickly, caused by a thromboembolic event involving the retinal artery. When no residual deficit remains, amaurosis fugax is characterized as a transient ischemic attack of the retina. It is classically associated with carotid stenosis secondary to atherosclerosis as a source of embolus, often indicating the need for medical or surgical optimization of carotid vascular disease to prevent a future catastrophic stroke or retinal artery occlusion. Following an episode of amaurosis fugax, funduscopic examination may be normal. It may show diminished arterial blood flow in the event of ongoing central retinal artery occlusion (characterized by a pale retina with cherry red macula), or branch retinal artery cholesterol emboli (Hollenhorst plaques) as seen in this patient. The patient should receive an ultrasonography or CT angiography of the carotid to assess the extent of disease, caliber, and flow; carotid endarterectomy may be indicated in cases of moderate to severe stenosis to reduce the risk for future stroke. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E.",
        "C": "Arteriography is an interventional procedure that involves injecting contrast material into an artery to permit visualization under fluoroscopy. This technique risks toxicity to the kidney and is invasive; it has largely been replaced by CT scan and MR angiography for initial vascular evaluation. Peritoneal lavage (Choice D) involves aspiration of peritoneal contents, infusing sterile saline into the peritoneal cavity, and analyzing the effluent. If blood, food particles, bile, bilirubin, amylase, or alkaline phosphatase are found, exploratory laparotomy is indicated as the presence of these findings suggests hollow or solid viscus injury. Peritoneal lavage has no role in evaluating retroperitoneal structures such as the kidney. Exploratory operation (Choice E) may be required depending on the degree of renal injury but should not be performed prior to assessing the extent of injury through diagnostic imaging as the patient is otherwise stable. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 48 of 50 'I",
        "E": "Glaucoma occurs because of acute or chronic increases in pressure within the anterior chamber of the eye and may present as acute, painful, or chronic, painless vision loss. It is caused by the overproduction or impaired absorption of aqueous humor. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 47 of 50 'I 47 . A 42-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 17 minutes after being involved in a motor vehicle collision . She has abdominal and left flank pain. She is hemodynamically stable . There is tenderness over the left flank but no external marks . Urinalysis shows gross blood . Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Renal blood flow scan B) CT scan of the abdomen and kidneys C) Arteriography D) Peritoneal lavage E) Exploratory operation Correct Answer: B. CT scan of the abdomen and kidneys is the most appropriate next step when renal injury is suspected following blunt trauma. Blunt renal injury can result from moderate- to high-energy mechanisms, such as falls or motor vehicle accidents. The spectrum of potential injury includes renal contusion, laceration, hematoma, pelvic or calyceal rupture, and partial or complete devascularization. Evaluation for renal injury in the emergent setting includes imaging, typically CT scan with contrast of the abdomen and pelvis, and urinalysis to assess for the presence of gross or microscopic hematuria. Small, uncomplicated injuries may be managed conservatively with serial examinations and observation; large, complicated, or devitalizing injuries may require surgical intervention. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E. Renal blood flow scan (Choice A), also known as renal scintigraphy, involves the use of an injected radiotracer to evaluate and quantify the flow of blood to the kidney. It would not provide fine anatomic detail of traumatic injuries and is a time-consuming test that is not indicated in the emergent post-traumatic setting."

Sulfonylurea therapy (Choice E) is appropriate for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus; however, endogenous production of insulin is diminished in chronic pancreatitis. Native production of insulin by pancreatic islet cells is required for successful sulfonylurea therapy. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 49 of 50 'I 49 . A 52-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of progressive difficulty swallowing , intermittent vomiting of undigested food , and a cough that is more severe at night.

Manometry shows normal lower esophageal sphincter pressure and absent lower esophageal sphincter relaxation with swallowing . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Achalasia B) Diffuse esophageal spasm C) Globus hystericus D) Hiatal hernia E) Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) Correct Answer: A. Achalasia is a type of esophageal dysmotility disorder resulting from deficient peristalsis along the length of the esophagus and impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. It manifests as dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, halitosis, and regurgitation of undigested food. It is diagnosed through a barium swallow plus esophageal manometry. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Diffuse esophageal spasm (Choice B) presents with abrupt onset chest pain, lasting for a few minutes to hours, often self-aborting, and often in response to consumption of a triggering food or in the presence of an impacted food bolus. Spasms are typically not associated with weight loss or vomiting of undigested food. Globus hystericus (Choice C) describes the sensation of a mass in the oropharynx typically associated with emotional distress or signs of concomitant gastroesophageal reflux. Chronic symptoms of weight loss would not be expected. Hiatal hernia (Choice D) is often asymptomatic but can present with epigastric or inferior chest pain, acid reflux, or nausea; dysphagia is generally less likely to be present, unless the patient demonstrates a severe paraesophageal hiatal hernia. Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) (Choice E) can present with esophageal dysmotility but would also often be accompanied by taut, hardened skin; Raynaud phenomenon; end-stage kidney disease; telangiectasias; cardiac fibrosis; and lower gastrointestinal tract fibrosis. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 50 of 50 'I"

Superficial burns (first-degree) do not involve layers deep to the epidermis and are characterized by erythema and pain, without blistering or loss of sensation. Partial thickness (second-degree) burns involve the epidermis and a portion of the dermis; they classically present with blistering, sloughing, severe pain, and erythema. Full thickness (third-degree) burns involve the epidermis and the full dermis, and are often accompanied by an insensate, charred, or leathery appearance. When calculating burned body surface area, only partial thickness and full thickness burns are counted. Superficial burns are not considered significant regarding fluid balance and resuscitation or the need for surgical intervention, as the stratum basalis and stem cells within hair follicles are preserved. In a superficial burn, the epidermis can regenerate from these unaffected sources of stem cells, whereas grafting may be required for deeper burns harming the cells responsible for tissue repair and regeneration. Uncomplicated, superficial burns require only observation and supportive therapy (e.g., aloe ointment, pain control).",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Adhesions are the most common cause of small bowel obstruction (SBO) in patients with a prior history of intra-abdominal surgery. Obstruction of the small bowel occurs from partial or complete blockage of the small bowel lumen and typically presents with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Partial SBO allows a degree of continued flatus with diminished stooling, and complete SBO will result in obstipation (no passage of stool or flatus). SBO has many potential etiologies, with peritoneal adhesions that form following a previous intra-abdominal surgery being the most frequent. On physical examination, SBO typically presents with abdominal tenderness, distention, tympany to percussion, and borborygmi (high-pitched, hyperactive bowel sounds). Potential complications of SBO include bowel rupture and/or necrosis, which can result in sudden onset peritonitic abdominal signs such as rebound tenderness and guarding. Abdominal x-rays typically demonstrate multiple air-fluid levels in the setting of dilated small bowel loops. Management requires bowel rest and intravenous hydration followed by surgical intervention if the obstruction does not autoreduce. Partial SBO may resolve with monitoring, supportive care, and bowel rest, whereas complete obstruction or any complicated partial obstruction generally requires management through exploratory laparotomy.",

        "B": "Diabetic neuropathy is a microvascular complication of long-standing diabetes mellitus that typically presents in a 'stocking and glove' distribution of the hands and feet. If associated neuropathy of the autonomic nervous system occurs, this can result in complications such as diabetic gastroparesis or dysautonomia. Gastroparesis typically presents with slowly progressive early satiety, nausea, vomiting of undigested food, and abdominal bloating with a succussion splash heard during physical examination. Inguinal hernias (Choice C) are protrusions of abdominal contents into the inguinal region through a defect in the lower abdominal wall. Incarceration and strangulation are potential complications of inguinal hernias and may require surgical correction. Hernias are the second most common cause of SBO in patients with a prior history of intra-abdominal surgery. Mesenteric ischemia (Choice D) can occur in acute and chronic forms. Acute mesenteric ischemic typically occurs from a critical decrease in intestinal blood flow, most commonly from thromboembolic occlusion of a mesenteric vessel (e.g., superior mesenteric artery) or a severe hypoperfusion state (e.g., hemorrhagic shock). This results in ischemia and potential necrosis of the bowel, which presents with abdominal pain out of proportion to the physical examination findings. Sigmoid volvulus (Choice E) results from twisting of the sigmoid mesentery, which can lead to large bowel obstruction and potential rupture or necrosis if not treated. It typically demonstrates a coffee-bean appearance on abdominal x-rays. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 3 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "lntraductal papilloma is the most common cause of unilateral bloody nipple discharge. Nipple discharge is concerning for underlying malignant pathology if presenting as spontaneous bloody, serosanguinous, or clear unilateral discharge or if there is discharge in the setting of a palpable breast mass. lntraductal papillomas are benign tumors originating from the walls of milk ducts that typically grow and can result in local duct obstruction. Papillomas can be solitary or multiple, and while typically benign, can contain areas of atypia or carcinoma. Mammography is not typically sensitive for intraductal papilloma, particularly when small. Galactography can be performed, involving cannulation and injection of contrast into a duct, which demonstrates a filling defect. Breast ultrasound and MRI can also be utilized to evaluate the extent and characteristics of the papillomas. Treatment typically requires surgical excision to exclude components of atypia or neoplasia.",

        "A": "Breast abscess is a potential complication of mastitis, most commonly occurring in breast-feeding women. It typically presents with preceding findings of mastitis, with a localized region of developing indurated, fluctuant tissue. Breast cancer (Choice B) encompasses many types of breast carcinoma, including invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, inflammatory breast carcinoma, and cystosarcoma phyllodes (Choice C). The most common type is invasive ductal carcinoma, which typically presents as a palpable, immobile breast mass that may demonstrate features such as spiculated margins and microcalcifications on mammography. They can be associated with pathologic nipple discharge, although intraductal papillomas more commonly present with unilateral bloody nipple discharge.",
        "D": "Galactocele presents as a painless breast lump typically following cessation of lactation. They do not present with pathologic nipple discharge, and they often resolve spontaneously.",
        "E": "Hematoma may occur following trauma or surgery to the breast. This would likely present as a focal area of induration or fluctuance at the site of injury. Inflammatory carcinoma of the breast (Choice F) results from breast carcinoma invading the dermal lymphatics, resulting in diffuse cutaneous thickening and peau d'orange appearance. It is less likely to present with unilateral bloody nipple discharge. Sebaceous cyst (Choice H), also known as an epidermal inclusion cyst, describes a cutaneous lesion that contains proliferating squamous epithelium and sebum, typically presenting as a firm, rubbery, nontender skin lump. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 4 of 50 'I"

Masses arising from the rectum and perineum in the setting of a known history of HIV and perianal warts may represent giant condyloma acuminatum (genital warts) or verrucous carcinoma (variant of well-differentiated squamous carcinoma). Condyloma acuminatum and verrucous carcinoma are both associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). Warts and verrucous carcinoma can appear on the penis, vagina, vulva, and/or anal canal, and patients with HIV are prone to severe condyloma lesions in these regions.

The most common location of penile cancer is the glans penis. Squamous cell carcinoma can range in presentation from a small area of induration to a large ulcerating, infiltrative lesion. Differential considerations for an ulcerative penile lesion also include primary syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum, and chancroid.

While commonly a pathogen located in respiratory and oral secretions, HSV-1 does have the potential for sexual contact transmission, along with herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), which can lead to genital herpes. HSV-2 may also present with oral or labial lesions or encephalitis. Inguinal hernias (Choice E) are protrusions of abdominal contents into the inguinal region through a defect in the lower abdominal wall. Incarceration and strangulation are potential complications of inguinal hernias and may require surgical correction. Nongonococcal urethritis (Choice F) is commonly secondary to infection from Chlamydia trachomatis and typically presents with painful urination and watery urethral discharge. Gram stain of urine typically demonstrates a sterile pyuria, characterized by the presence of white blood cells without organisms. Diagnosis is through a urine nucleic acid amplification test. Chlamydia trachomatis is a common sexually transmitted disease that can cause cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, epididymitis, and urethritis.

A common initiating factor for the development of an anal fissure is the passage of hard stool resulting in trauma to the anal mucosa. While some anal fissures self-resolve, persistent anal fissures can result in anal spasms and increased sphincter tone on examination. Initial management for persistent, symptomatic anal fissures includes administration of stool softeners, Sitz bath, topical analgesics, and topical vasodilators. The goal of this combination therapy is to relieve pain, allow for anal sphincter relaxation, and reduce traumatic passage of stool through the anal canal. Sitz bath allows for anal sphincter relaxation and improved anal mucosa blood flow to promote healing.",

CT scan of the head without contrast is indicated for the emergent evaluation of undifferentiated intracranial pathologies, especially following trauma where there may be concern for calvarial fractures, intracranial hemorrhage, and herniation. Bilateral burr holes (Choice E) would reduce the patient's intracranial pressure and are typically used in the management of extra-axial hematomas.

The patient presents with a history of hypertension and hypokalemia, with evidence of hyperaldosteronism indicated by an elevated aldosterone:renin ratio. A CT scan demonstrates a left adrenal mass, possibly an adrenal adenoma, with bilateral hypersecretion of aldosterone on adrenal vein sampling, which may indicate bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, resulting in excess secretion of aldosterone. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that serves as an aldosterone receptor antagonist. This causes diminished effects of aldosterone on the renal collecting tubules, which results in decreased sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Candesartan therapy is an angiotensin 11 receptor blocker used primarily in the management of hypertension, heart failure, and end-stage kidney disease. It would not provide any clinical benefit in a patient with hyperaldosteronism, as renin and angiotensin II levels are appropriately suppressed because of excess aldosterone level. Furosemide therapy (Choice B) is indicated for the management of hypervolemic states such as heart failure and cirrhosis. A known adverse effect is hypokalemia. Bilateral adrenalectomy (Choice D) is a definitive treatment for refractory Cushing disease and is less commonly used in the setting of hyperaldosteronism. First-line management requires use of an aldosterone antagonist, as a bilateral adrenalectomy would require close monitoring and supplementation of adrenal hormones. Unilateral adrenalectomy (Choice E) is indicated for the resection of a hyperfunctioning adrenal adenoma. In this case, adrenal vein sampling indicates bilateral hypersecretion of aldosterone, suggestive of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, rather than a solitary hyperfunctioning adrenal adenoma. r \" , r-- r , 11 . A 47-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 5-week history of generalized itching and yellow skin. He underwent a total colectomy for ulcerative colitis 10 years ago. He has Gilbert syndrome , osteoarthritis , and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Current medications include fluoxetine and daily ibuprofen . He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years and drinks three alcoholic beverages daily. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min , and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice . There are excoriations over the back. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities . Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 13 g/dL Hematocrit 39% Leukocyte count 8000/mm 3 Serum Bilirubin , total 12.2 mg/dL Direct 10 mg/dL Alkaline phosphatase 490 U/L Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography shows narrowing of the biliary ducts . Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition? A) Alcohol consumption B) Cigarette smoking C) Gilbert syndrome D) Ibuprofen therapy E) Ulcerative colitis Correct Answer: E. Ulcerative colitis is associated with the development of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PSC is a biliary tract disease that affects both the intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts. It causes progressive inflammation and concentric fibrosis of the bile ducts, resulting in alternating regions of strictures and dilations ('beading'). These biliary strictures result in cholestasis and inadequate biliary excretion. PSC most commonly occurs in younger and middle-age men. It typically presents with progressive jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, pruritus, light-colored stools, and dark urine. Laboratory values may demonstrate a direct hyperbilirubinemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, and a detectable peripheral anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA). Patients with PSC are at increased risk for developing cholangiocarcinoma. Diagnostic evaluation occurs through endoscopic or magnetic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP/MRCP), which demonstrates the strictures and dilations of the intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts; and via liver biopsy. Treatment includes dilation and stenting of strictures to improve biliary excretion, and if severe, liver transplantation may be required. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Alcohol consumption (Choice A) can result in progressive hepatocellular injury and increased risk for cirrhosis, which may present with a mixed direct/indirect hyperbilirubinemia in the setting of cirrhotic clinical sequelae such as hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathy. Biliary strictures and dilations would be less likely in isolation. Cigarette smoking (Choice B) is not a risk factor for primary sclerosing cholangitis. It is actually associated with a reduced severity of ulcerative colitis. Gilbert syndrome (Choice C) results in a mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia secondary to mildly decreased conjugation and impaired bilirubin uptake following a stress event. Ibuprofen therapy (Choice D), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is not associated with an increased risk for biliary strictures. The most common gastrointestinal adverse effect is the development of peptic ulcer disease and gastritis because of impaired prostaglandin-driven mucosal protective mechanisms. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 12 of 50 'I"

Enteral feeding refers to the administration of nutrition to a patient through the gastrointestinal tract. The patient recently underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy and has a jejunostomy tube in place distal to the anastomosis. The patient is unable to receive nutrition by mouth ('per os') as the surgical anastomosis requires time to heal prior to receiving an oral food bolus. The jejunostomy tube is located distal to the surgical anastomosis and presents a route for enteral nutrition that would allow for enteral feeds and concomitant appropriate healing of the anastomosis. Enteral feeding is the preferred method for providing nutrition to patients, if possible, as it is the closest to normal, physiologic nutrition. It presents few complications and is low-cost.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "dextrose in water can provide patients with supplementation to maintain glucose levels and is commonly used in the acute setting for management of hypoglycemia. It is not a suitable substitute for long-term feeding as it only provides dextrose, with no additional protein, lipid, vitamin, or mineral content. Parenteral administration of lipid emulsion (Choice C) and total parenteral nutrition (Choice D) are forms of intravenous nutrition. These routes are used when the patient is unable to receive adequate caloric and nutrient intake through an enteral route (e.g., short gut syndrome). Parenteral nutrition typically has a specific composition of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, electrolytes, and vitamins that are specifically tailored for the patient's nutrition requirements. No nutrients should be given at this time (Choice E) is not the appropriate next step, as surgical healing requires appropriate nutritional provision. In absence of adequate nutrition, the patient's overall clinical condition would deteriorate because of inadequate energy substrate and anabolic supply, resulting in delayed post-surgical healing, muscle and fat wasting, and potential starvation ketosis. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 13 of 50 'I"

This derangement in native microbiota presents an opportunity for competition-free proliferation of C. difficile, which produces toxins that result in dysfunction of the brush border and a subsequent secretory diarrhea. C. difficile infections are associated with the presence of pseudomembranes that appear as patchy regions of white mucosa on colonoscopy. The severity of C. difficile colitis can vary, ranging from watery diarrhea without constitutional symptoms in mild cases to toxic megacolon, colonic ischemia, and severe sepsis in fulminant cases. Treatment includes oral or rectal vancomycin, intravenous metronidazole, fidaxomicin, or colectomy depending on the severity of the patient's presentation.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Blind loop syndrome can occur in cases of impaired bowel motility such as structural pouch creation during Billroth or Roux-En-Y bypass. Resultant stagnation of intestinal food bolus passage increases the risk for bacterial overgrowth. The uncontrolled growth of bacteria occurs because of the loss of peristaltic propulsion and leads to malabsorption, diarrhea, bloating, and chronic abdominal pain. Dumping syndrome (Choice C) is a potential complication of gastric bypass resulting from the rapid emptying of contents from the stomach into the small bowel. This results in an abnormal osmotic gradient within the small bowel, which can present 15 to 30 minutes after eating a meal with severe nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. lschemic colitis (Choice D) refers to inadequate blood supply to the colon, which can lead to bowel wall necrosis, loss of immune barriers, and bowel perforation. This most commonly occurs in the setting of atherosclerosis, an embolic event in the setting of atrial fibrillation, or systemic hypotension. Loss of vagal innervation to the ileum (Choice E) would result in diminished peristalsis along the region of denervation. This may occur as a post-surgical complication but would not be expected to result in severe watery diarrhea. Mesenteric vein thrombosis (Choice F) can occur in the setting of hypercoagulability, postsurgical state, and inflammatory diseases such as pancreatitis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis.

The most likely etiology of this mass is focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), a regenerative lesion of the liver, and the second most common benign lesion of the liver following hepatic hemangioma. It is typically asymptomatic and found incidentally in patients with right upper quadrant pain. CT scan and MRI typically demonstrate a classic central scar with radiating fibrous septa ('spoke wheel'). FNH lesions exhibit no malignant potential and do not require further testing for diagnostic workup or therapeutic intervention.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "fetoprotein concentration is indicated for surveillance of patients with an increased risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (e.g., chronic hepatitis B infection). Hepatitis B virus serology (Choice B) is used in the evaluation of patients with exposure to Hepatitis B to determine if they demonstrate an acute or chronic hepatitis B infection pattern, or if they exhibit appropriate immunization serology. Radionuclide liver scan (Choice C) can be used for the evaluation of a liver mass in differentiating FNH from other primary hepatic masses. In general, hepatic masses apart from FNH will be 'cold' on a radionuclide liver scan with a region of relative photopenia (decreased tracer uptake) corresponding to the site of the mass. Because FNH contains Kupffer reticuloendothelial cells, it takes up radiotracer similar to the background liver. This patient's diagnosis of FNH can be concluded from the ultrasonography and CT scan, making a nuclear liver scan unnecessary. MRI of the liver (Choice D) can be used to further characterize a hepatic mass when the diagnosis is uncertain. MRI offers better contrast resolution than both ultrasonography and CT scan, which allows for more definitive diagnostic evaluation in certain settings. This patient's diagnosis of FNH can be concluded from the ultrasonography and CT scan, making MRI unnecessary. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the mass (Choice E) is sometimes indicated for the pathologic evaluation of focal hepatic masses. This patient's ultrasonography and CT scan accurately determine the presence of an FNH, which does not require a biopsy for further workup. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 15 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Rupture of the bladder most commonly occurs in the setting of abdominal or pelvic trauma or from iatrogenic injury of the bladder in the setting of surgery or cystoscopy. The two most common types of bladder rupture are extraperitoneal (-80%) and intraperitoneal (-15%). Extraperitoneal ruptures typically occur in the setting of penetrating trauma and pelvic fractures, while intraperitoneal ruptures are typically associated with direct blows to already distended urinary bladders. Ruptures present with severe lower abdominal and pelvic pain and tenderness with associated anuria; blood may be noted at the urethral meatus on examination. CT scan or fluoroscopic cystography is the diagnostic examination of choice, with contrast leaking into the retro/extraperitoneal space in an extraperitoneal rupture and into the peritoneal cavity in an intraperitoneal rupture. Management depends on the type of rupture. Extraperitoneal ruptures are typically treated with an indwelling Foley catheter to minimize urinary bladder intraluminal pressure and allow healing, while intraperitoneal ruptures typically require surgical repair.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Acute tubular necrosis typically occurs following an ischemic or nephrotoxic insult to the kidneys, which results in necrosis of the tubular epithelium. Granular, muddy brown casts are usually present on urinalysis. It is not typically associated with trauma, unless concomitant shock is present resulting in renal ischemia.",
        "B": "Hypovolemia can result in anuria if severe, although this patient has received multiple administrations of isotonic fluid and demonstrates no additional features of hypovolemia. More likely, the patient's anuria is a result of urinary bladder rupture. Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (vasopressin) (Choice D) results from excessive ADH production, most commonly in the setting of small cell lung carcinoma or intracranial pathology, including head trauma. This leads to the development of hypotonic, euvolemic hyponatremia. Transection of the urethra (Choice E) would result in anuria, although this would likely present with blood at the urethral meatus. Urethral injuries can occur from straddle injuries (anterior urethra) or pelvic fractures (posterior urethra). The patient has a urinary catheter in place with continued anuria, which would bypass a urethral injury. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 18 of 50 'I"

Lacerations to the scalp can result in hemodynamically significant blood loss because of its rich vascularity. In this specific case, airway and breathing are managed, which indicates that the immediate attention should be paid to circulation and hemodynamic stability. Tachycardia is a sign of hypovolemia, which must be attributed to hemorrhagic shock at this stage of workup. Given the patient's otherwise unremarkable physical examination outside of his left humeral fracture, direct pressure should be applied to the scalp wound, and intravascular volume loss should be replaced with 0.9% saline, followed by an emergent blood transfusion if hemodynamic instability results.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "CT scan of the abdomen is not the best next step for this patient as he presents with a benign abdomen on physical examination, borderline hemodynamic instability, and injuries primarily to the head with visible blood loss. CT scan of the abdomen may be utilized in the evaluation of blunt abdominal injury in a stable patient, whereas focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) is used for hemodynamically unstable patients with a suspected abdominal source of bleeding. Intravenous administration of a vasopressor (Choice C) is indicated for the treatment of shock unresponsive to intravenous fluids or blood in the setting of hemorrhage. Transfusion of type-specific packed red blood cells (Choice D) is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic severe anemia or active bleeding . In the acute traumatic setting, non-type-specific packed red blood cells are used because of the rapid requirement for transfusion; however, transfusion should follow attempts at hemostasis through compression if unstable vital signs persist. Closed reduction of the fracture (Choice E) may be required once the left humerus is examined with x-rays to assess the fracture pattern. Humerus fractures are seldom a source of internal exsanguination, in contrast to femur and pelvic fractures . r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 19 of 50 'I"

VSD results in a left-to-right shunt, which increases pulmonary blood flow. This leads to remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature and resultant smooth muscle hypertrophy. In turn, concentric narrowing of the pulmonary arterioles occurs, which results in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension. If severe and progressive enough, this can cause increased right ventricular pressures and associated myocardial hypertrophy, which subsequently results in reversal of the shunt, presenting with shortness of breath and cyanosis.

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms? A) Decreased pulmonary artery flow B) Decreased pulmonary vascular resistance C) Decreased systemic vascular resistance D) Increased pulmonary artery blood flow E) Increased pulmonary vascular resistance F) Increased systemic vascular resistance Correct Answer: E. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance occurs in the setting of a persistent, chronic left-to-right shunt. The patient has a history of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair as a child, although she exhibits a holosystolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border, which suggests the continued presence of a VSD. VSD results in a left-to-right shunt, which increases pulmonary blood flow. This leads to remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature and resultant smooth muscle hypertrophy. In turn, concentric narrowing of the pulmonary arterioles occurs, which results in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension. If severe and progressive enough, this can cause increased right ventricular pressures and associated myocardial hypertrophy, which subsequently results in reversal of the shunt, presenting with shortness of breath and cyanosis. The patient's elevated pulmonary artery and right-heart pressures increase her risk for right-sided heart failure explaining her lower extremity edema, and for atrial fibrillation explaining her irregularly irregular tachyarrhythmia. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, and F. Decreased pulmonary artery flow (Choice A) occurs in the setting of some right-to-left shunts, for example, Tetralogy of Fallo! that presents with pulmonary infundibular stenosis. Decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (Choice B) occurs in the setting of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Decreased systemic vascular resistance (Choice C) would result in decreased systemic mean arterial pressure and may be seen in cases of distributive shock such as anaphylaxis, sepsis, and neurogenic shock. Increased pulmonary artery blood flow (Choice D) occurs in the setting of a persistent left-to-right shunt. This patient likely demonstrated chronic increased pulmonary artery blood flow from a persistent shunt, which led to pulmonary vascular remodeling. Her current presentation is secondary to the resultant increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Increased systemic vascular resistance (Choice F) would result in increased systemic mean arterial pressure and is a common cause of chronic hypertension. This patient's presentation is secondary to increased pulmonary vascular resistance from chronic remodeling, not systemic vascular resistance. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 22 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Immediate surgical exploration of the upper abdomen is indicated in cases of a perforated hollow viscus. Perforation can result from traumatic injury, erosion of an ulcer or gastritis through the muscularis and adventitia, malignant invasion, or necrosis or infarction of a segment of bowel, and presents with symptoms of peritonitis. Peritonitis classically presents as acute, severe abdominal pain which may rapidly progress to sepsis and shock. Patients typically demonstrate unstable vital signs such as fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. Examination discloses a guarded and rigid abdomen, which is often \"board-like\". Due to translocation of intraluminal contents into the peritoneal space, fulminant sepsis can ensue. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (e.g. aspirin and ibuprofen) is a key risk factor for the development of peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, and should raise suspicion for a perforated viscus in the setting of an acutely peritonitic patient. These medications inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which plays a critical role in the maintenance of the gastric mucosal barrier by counterbalancing the erosive effects of stomach acid through the synthesis of bicarbonate and mucus. Pneumoperitoneum on the chest x-ray shows the presence of a perforated hollow viscus. Peritonitis requires emergent exploratory laparotomy to locate and control the source and washout peritoneal contents that may promote ongoing infection.",

Patients at higher risk for aspiration include those with impaired airway-protective cough mechanisms (e.g., Parkinson disease, stroke, myasthenia gravis, depressed mental status), frequent or forceful emesis (e.g., alcohol use disorder, cyclic vomiting syndrome), or abnormal pharyngeal or airway anatomy (e.g., malignancy, trachea-esophageal fistula). These patients are more likely to aspirate gastric contents into the lung, which results in bacterial seeding with gastrointestinal or oral flora and can lead to pneumonia. Frequently, aspiration occurs in a dependent segment of the lung such as bilateral lower lobes when erect or the lingula, right middle lobe, and superior segments of the lower lobes while lying down.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Adverse effects of hydromorphone include gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, vomiting, and constipation; significant respiratory depression; altered mental status; and miosis in the setting of overdose. This can result in aspiration of contents because of a depressed mental status and failure of airway protection. However, this patient does not show signs of significant impairment from hydromorphone, making impaired airway protective reflexes in the setting of known Parkinson disease more likely. Impaired esophageal motility (Choice D) is a potential cause of aspiration because of impaired transit of food bolus along the length of the esophagus, which can result in regurgitation and increased risk for aspiration. This patient demonstrates vomiting in the postoperative period with a history of Parkinson disease, which likely explains her aspiration event, not esophageal dysmotility. Increased salivation (Choice E) is a potential adverse effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used in myasthenia gravis or Alzheimer disease. It is not a typical adverse effect of carbidopa-levodopa or additional medications the patient is currently taking. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 24 of 50 'I"

Idiopathic infertility (Choice B) is not the correct answer as the patient demonstrates a left-sided varicocele, which is a known cause of infertility related to increased scrotal and testicular temperature. Increased serum corticosteroid concentration (Choice D) is characteristic of Cushing syndrome, which commonly presents with features of hypertension, moon facies, abdominal striae, osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, and amenorrhea. It can result in infertility in women, which is related to amenorrhea. While it can result in impotence and decreased libido in men, it is not directly associated with male infertility. Isolated luteinizing hormone deficiency (Choice E) is an uncommon cause of infertility in men. Insufficient production of luteinizing hormone would result in inadequate stimulation of Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone.

The risk for hemodynamic compromise from a large pulmonary embolus outweighs the risk for bleeding at 3 days post-operation. The patient should be treated with heparin which will allow for immediate anticoagulation, along with rapid reversal if bleeding complications arise.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Administration of warfarin is indicated for chronic anticoagulation of venous thromboembolism but would not be appropriate as isolated therapy without heparin bridging. Pulmonary angiography (Choice C) constitutes invasive catheter angiographic evaluation of the pulmonary arteries. This is no longer necessary for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism given advances in ventilation perfusion scans and CT pulmonary angiography, but may still be performed during pulmonary embolectomy (Choice E). Embolectomy is sometimes required in the setting of a massive pulmonary embolism resulting in obstructive shock and systemic hypotension, or in setting of severe right heart strain, which may require more rapid removal of the embolus. Placement of a vena cava filter (Choice D) is indicated for the prevention of further pulmonary emboli from deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremities when a patient has a contraindication to therapeutic anticoagulation. Common contraindications to therapeutic anticoagulation include bleeding diatheses, active hemorrhage, immediate postoperative state, or a history of hemorrhagic stroke. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 31 of 50 'I 31 .

A) Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma B) Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease) C) Graves disease D) Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland E) Subacute thyroiditis Correct Answer: B. Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease) is the most common form of thyroiditis and is characterized by the presence of antithyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin antibodies. The early stages of Hashimoto thyroiditis can present with neck swelling and a diffusely enlarged, nontender thyroid gland. The patient's clinical symptoms and thyroid laboratory studies may demonstrate no significant abnormalities or can show evidence of hyperthyroidism from destruction of thyroid follicular cells and the unregulated release of thyroid hormone. During the chronic stages of Hashimoto thyroiditis, the patient typically develops primary hypothyroidism from the underlying inflammatory destruction of normal thyroid parenchyma and resultant insufficient production of thyroid hormone. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (Choice A) is a type of thyroid cancer that typically occurs in older patients. It exhibits a very poor prognosis and has the ability to invade local structures such as the esophagus and trachea, producing symptoms such as dysphagia and hoarseness. Graves disease (Choice C) is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism and occurs because of the presence of TSH-receptor-stimulating antibodies. This results in a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland on physical examination, along with pretibial myxedema and exophthalmos. Thyroid laboratory studies typically demonstrate findings of a primary hyperthyroidism with increased thyroxine and triiodothyronine, and decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone. Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland (Choice D) is the most common thyroid cancer. It typically presents with a solitary thyroid nodule and is characterized by the presence of nuclear grooves with empty-appearing nuclei and psammoma bodies on histological evaluation. It typically carries a good prognosis. Subacute thyroiditis (Choice E), also known as granulomatous de Quervain thyroiditis, is a self-limited thyroiditis that typically presents with tender thyroid gland enlargement often associated with flu-like symptoms. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 32 of 50 'I"

If accumulation progresses, mediastinal structures may be stretched or compressed, compromising venous return and resulting in obstructive shock (known as a tension pneumothorax). On physical examination, a pneumothorax presents as unilateral diminished breath sounds with hyperresonance to percussion. Obstruction of venous return results in jugular venous distention, and shifting of mediastinal structures results in contralateral tracheal deviation.

Typical symptoms of a large venous air embolism include acute shortness of breath, tachypnea, and chest pain. Cardiac tamponade (Choice B) occurs from rapid-onset and/or large volume pericardia! effusions resulting in compression of the cardiac chambers and obstructive shock. Physical examination findings include Beck triad (hypotension, distended jugular veins, and distant heart sounds).

Physical examination typically demonstrates reduced breath sounds on the side of injury along with dullness to percussion. Hemorrhagic shock can result from substantial blood losses into the hemithorax.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "A lung abscess presents with symptoms of pulmonary infection such as cough, hemoptysis, fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia with a cavitary lesion often containing an air-fluid level present on imaging. It is a potential complication of pneumonia, especially in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mechanical ventilation, or immunosuppression. ARDS is characterized by respiratory failure with bilateral diffuse interstitial and airspace opacities from underlying diffuse alveolar damage and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. ARDS is associated with aspiration, pneumonia, trauma, sepsis, and shock. Mechanical ventilation is often required in the management of ARDS because of hypoxia and hypoventilation. Further, polymicrobial flora on bronchial washings raises concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The most common organisms in the setting of VAP are gram-negative rods (e.g., Klebsiel/a species, Pseudomonas species), anaerobes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Given the virulence of the possible underlying infectious organisms, the development of a new cavitary lesion is likely secondary to the formation of a lung abscess. Treatment requires further administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, prevention of aspiration, and source control with surgical resection or percutaneous drainage.",

        "B": "Atelectasis refers to the partial or complete collapse or incomplete expansion of pulmonary parenchyma. There are multiple types of atelectasis, including obstructive, passive, compressive, cicatricial, and adhesive. It is most common in patients who are immobile and/or in the post-surgical state, who are unable to produce adequate tidal volume to expand the lungs. Atelectasis would not present with a cavitary lesion.",

The arteriogram demonstrates dense contrast located in the right external iliac and femoral arteries, with contrast inappropriately seen in the adjacent right femoral vein and distal external iliac vein. The patient's clinical presentation and findings on arteriography indicate the formation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), likely a complication of the previous arteriography. This AVF results in abnormal communication between an artery and vein, leading to low resistance, high-volume flow of blood between the artery and vein. An AVF reduces systemic vascular resistance through the creation of a shunt to the high capacitance, low pressure venous system and can lead to the development of high-output cardiac failure. The size of the AVF is most predictive of the risk for developing heart failure, as a larger AVF results in higher flow between the artery and vein, requiring the heart to compensate with greater output to supply the remainder of the systemic circulation.",

        "A": "Degree of edema in the lower extremity would be an indicator of heart failure in a patient with systolic or diastolic heart failure not secondary to an arteriovenous fistula. Lower extremity edema is an indicator of right-sided heart failure, and the degree of edema may indicate the severity of dysfunction. Groin compression causing bradycardia (Choice B) can occur as a vasovagal reaction in response to the compression of the groin. This is not related to the arteriovenous fistula and risk for heart failure. Presence of pallor with elevation and dependent rubor (Choice C) are consistent with peripheral arterial disease. In the setting of chronic claudication, severe peripheral arterial disease may be indicated by the presence of pallor with elevation and dependent rubor. Presence of a pseudoaneurysm (Choice D) may present with a pulsatile mass at the site of prior arteriography or trauma. On arteriography, pseudoaneurysms typically present as contrast-filled outpouchings near the site of prior arteriotomy.

The core ethical principles of medicine are autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice.

The patient is presenting with diverticulitis and is placed on appropriate medical management with bowel rest and antibiotic treatment. An operative procedure that would not improve the patient's condition but would expose the patient to increased risk for harm is not ethically appropriate. The appropriate course of action is to refuse the operation as the core ethical principles of nonmaleficence and beneficence outweigh autonomy in this scenario",

Obtain a court order to refuse the operation (Choice B) and obtain permission from the hospital ethics committee not to perform the operation (Choice C) are not appropriate courses of action, as it has already been determined that the operation is contraindicated and would place the patient at too much risk. It is the duty of the treating physician to abide by the core ethical principles and to balance the patient's wishes with the indications and potential harm of an operation. A court and hospital ethics committee serve to provide guidance in controversial and dubious medical decisions, not in clear cases. Proceed with the operation (Choice D) would align with the patient's wishes but would place the patient at an unacceptable risk for harm without any benefit. This decision would contradict the physician's duty to uphold the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 38 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Debridement and application of a sterile dressing to the open wound is indicated in the management of a human bite wound that extends into the subcutaneous tissue. The management of a human bite wound includes extensive cleaning with an antiseptic solution and debridement of the wound, followed by the application of a sterile dressing to the open wound to maintain cleanliness of the wound site. Because of the increased risk for infection from a human bite, especially from Eikenella corrodens, the wound is often left open as this reduces the risk for the development of infection. As well, any puncture wound that already demonstrates infection or is older than 6 to 12 hours should generally not be closed. Prophylactic antibiotics should be administered, specifically amoxicillin-clavulanate or ampicillin-sulbactam as these provide coverage for E. corrodens.",

The use of these various techniques depends on the size and location of the wound. The patient presents with a human bite wound 6 hours after it occurred. Given its increased risk for infection, the wound should not be closed unless necessary to reduce high-risk complications involving neurovascular or bony structures. It should be left open after debridement covered by a sterile dressing, which will reduce the risk for developing a wound site infection. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 40 of 50 'I 40 . A 38-year-old man has vomited small amounts of bright red blood on several occasions over the past 9 months . He has a duodenal ulcer and has had four episodes of abdominal pain and indigestion over the past 3 years , with the most recent episode occurring 5 months ago . Over the past year, he has had severe , persistent diarrhea , with four to six stools daily. Current examination shows a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1° F) and marked abdominal tenderness . The most appropriate next step is measurement of which of the following serum concentrations? A) Amylase B) a -Antitrypsin 1 C) Carcinoembryonic antigen D) Cortisol E) Gastrin Correct Answer: E. Gastrin is physiologically produced by G cells in the gastric antrum and functions to stimulate parietal cells within the gastric body to produce hydrochloric acid. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, the constellation of findings associated with gastrinoma, stems from a gastrin-secreting tumor located typically within the pancreas or duodenum. It results in excessive production of acid by the gastric parietal cells. This can lead to recurrent, chronic duodenal or jejunal ulcers, which can present with abdominal pain, diarrhea secondary to malabsorption, and possible hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. The initial step in evaluation of a gastrinoma is to measure the serum gastrin concentration. If abnormal, a secretin stimulation test should be performed, which would demonstrate elevated gastrin concentrations after administration of secretin, opposite of the normal, physiologic inhibition. Cross-sectional imaging should then be performed to determine the location of the gastrinoma for planning of surgical resection. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D Amylase {Choice A) is an enzyme that assists in the digestion of carbohydrates and is primarily secreted in saliva and from the exocrine pancreas. Increased amylase activity may indicate an underlying pathology of either the salivary glands (e.g., parotitis) or pancreas (e.g., pancreatitis). arAntitrypsin {Choice B) deficiency results in the early development of panacinar emphysema and cirrhosis. It is a hereditary disease resulting from misfolding of arantitrypsin, which aggregates in hepatocytes. This results in hepatocyte injury and progression to cirrhosis at a young age. The lack of functional arantitrypsin release also results in an imbalance of proteases and anti-proteases in the lung parenchyma, resulting in the destruction of alveolar septa and development of panacinar emphysema. Carcinoembryonic antigen {Choice C) is a nonspecific, often-increased tumor marker associated with colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Cortisol {Choice D) is typically measured in the evaluation of Cushing syndrome or Addison disease. Cushing syndrome commonly presents with hypertension, moon facies, abdominal striae, osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, and amenorrhea. Addison disease presents as primary adrenal insufficiency with generalized malaise, fatigue, myalgias, weight loss, weakness, hypoglycemia, and occasionally hypotension, with associated skin and mucosal hyperpigmentation. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 41 of 50 'I 41 . A 12-year-old boy has had weakness , pallor, and black, shiny stools for 5 days . He has had no abdominal pain or other symptoms . Laboratory studies show: Hematocrit 26% Mean corpuscular volume 70 µm 3 Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 22% Hb/cell An abdominal scintigram , using technetium 99m pertechnetate, shows uptake in the right lower quadrant separate from the activity in the stomach , kidneys , and bladder. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Henoch-Schonlein purpura B) lleocecal intussusception C) Juvenile colonic polyp D) Meckel diverticulum E) Ulcerative colitis CorrectAnswer: D. Meckel diverticulum is one of the most common causes of painless, bloody stools in children. A Meckel diverticulum results from persistence of the vitelline duct and can demonstrate ectopic, functional gastric or pancreatic tissue. It can present with acute or chronic hematochezia or melena, often painless, which can lead to the development of iron deficiency anemia. It typically presents in childhood, most commonly before age 2 years, although because of its indolent nature, it may not be diagnosed until later in life. It is commonly located 61 cm (2 ft) proximal to the ileocecal valve and is 5 cm (2 in) in length. Because of its location, it serves as a potential lead-point for intussusception. A technetium 99 m pertechnetate scan demonstrates uptake in the right lower quadrant, corresponding with ectopic gastric mucosa within the Meckel diverticulum. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Henoch-Schonlein purpura (Choice A) is a small-vessel vasculitis that occurs in children and typically presents with gravity-dependent purpura (e.g., buttocks, legs, and feet), arthralgias, hematuria, and abdominal pain (e.g., intussusception). lleocecal intussusception (Choice B) occurs from telescoping of the terminal ileum into the cecum. This can result in intermittent abdominal pain from compromised blood supply to the intussuscepted bowel. This typically occurs in children. It can present with 'currant jelly' stools if there is associated bowel infarction. Painless melena would not be expected. Juvenile colonic polyps (Choice C) can be associated with a variety of polyposis syndromes such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and juvenile polyposis syndrome. These syndromes feature primarily hamartomatous polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract and are associated with an increased risk for colorectal carcinoma. Meckel diverticulum is a much more common cause of painless melena in a child. Ulcerative colitis (Choice E) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that results in mucosal and submucosal ulceration and inflammation that progresses retrograde along the colon from the rectum. This typically presents with chronic bloody diarrhea, tenesmus, and abdominal pain. While inflammatory bowel disease can occur in children, it would not typically present with painless melena. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 42 of 50 'I 42 . A 19-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after his motorcycle collided head-on with a truck . No loss of consciousness at the scene is reported . On arrival , he is agitated but oriented to person , place , and time . He responds to verbal commands . Supplemental oxygen and intravenous fluids are administered . His pulse is 115/min, respirations are 18/min , and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. There are multiple abrasions over the forehead , chest , abdomen , and right lower extremity . The pupils are equal and reactive to light. The trachea is midline , and breath sounds are equal bilaterally . Heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is mildly distended , soft , and diffusely tender . His hemoglobin concentration is 11 .8 g/dL , and leukocyte count is 14,000/mm 3 Urinary catheterization yields clear urine . X-rays of the cervical spine and pelvis show no abnormalities . • An x-ray of the chest shows a moderate amount of free intra-abdominal air under the diaphragm . Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Lateral decubitus x-ray B) CT scan of the abdomen C) Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy D) Diagnostic peritoneal lavage E) Laparotomy Correct Answer: E. Laparotomy of the abdomen is indicated for the emergent investigation and management of a perforated hollow viscus. Abdominal pain, distention, tenderness to palpation, anemia, leukocytosis, and x-ray evidence of pneumoperitoneum following trauma is consistent with a perforated viscus and early peritonitis. Peritonitis requires emergent surgical laparotomy to identify and repair any perforation, lavage the peritoneum and prevent sepsis, exsanguination, and bowel necrosis. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Lateral decubitus x-ray (Choice A) of the abdomen can be utilized to better delineate the presence of pneumoperitoneum if there are indeterminate findings on prior x-rays. The patient should be positioned with the left side against the table, which will allow for visualization of free intra-abdominal air along the surface of the liver. CT scan of the abdomen (Choice B) and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (Choice C) are not indicated in the emergent management of an acute abdomen. The patient presents following trauma with pneumoperitoneum, a life-threatening condition that requires emergent laparotomy for definitive evaluation and management. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (Choice D) is used for the evaluation of hemoperitoneum in traumatic abdominal injury. While it has mostly been replaced by evaluation with ultrasound or CT scan, it may be useful in situations with equivocal results or low-resource settings. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 43 of 50 X"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Complete small-bowel obstruction (SBO) is the most likely diagnosis in a patient with previous abdominal surgery presenting with a history of abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation. Obstruction of the small bowel occurs from partial or complete blockage of the small bowel lumen and typically presents with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Partial SBO allows a degree of continued flatus with diminished stooling, and complete SBO will result in obstipation (no passage of stool or flatus). SBO has many potential etiologies, although the most common are post-surgical peritoneal adhesions and hernias. On physical examination, SBO typically presents with abdominal tenderness, distention, tympany to percussion, and borborygmi (high-pitched, hyperactive bowel sounds). Potential complications of SBO include bowel rupture and/or necrosis, which can result in sudden-onset peritonitic abdominal signs such as rebound tenderness and guarding. Abdominal x-rays typically demonstrate multiple air-fluid levels in the setting of dilated small bowel loops. Management requires bowel rest and intravenous hydration followed by surgical intervention if the obstruction does not autoreduce. Partial SBO may resolve with monitoring, supportive care, and bowel rest, whereas complete obstruction or any complicated partial obstruction generally requires management through exploratory laparotomy. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Acute cholecystitis (Choice A) presents with fever, abdominal pain, and tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant, often in a patient with a history of gallstones. It would be unlikely to result in small bowel obstruction unless it was complicated by the formation of a cholecystoduodenal fistula leading to gallstone ileus. Colon cancer (Choice B) most commonly occurs in the rectosigmoid region of the large bowel. Lesions within the ascending colon, by convention, typically result in an exophytic mass and slow bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia. Cancers within the descending and rectosigmoid colon are more likely to be infiltrative, resulting in partial obstruction of the large bowel. Colon cancer is unlikely to result in complete obstruction. lieus secondary to renal failure (Choice D) is less likely for this patient given her normal urea nitrogen, sodium, and potassium concentrations. lieus refers to intestinal hypomotility without a mechanical obstruction, most commonly occurring following surgery or in the setting of electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., end-stage kidney disease resulting in hyperkalemia), and typically presents with diffuse small and large bowel dilatation. A perforated viscus (Choice E) typically presents with acute-onset diffuse abdominal pain, with findings of abdominal rigidity, rebound tenderness, and guarding on physical examination ('peritoneal signs'). X-rays may demonstrate evidence of pneumoperitoneum, preferably obtained in an erect or left lateral decubitus position. Emergent surgical laparotomy is required for diagnosis and management of the underlying etiology. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 44 of 50 'I 44 . A 25-year-old construction worker has had fever and a painful , swollen right hand for 2 days . His temperature is 39 °C (102 .2°F) . The dorsum of the hand is swollen , erythematous , and tender; there is a small traumatic laceration on the dorsum of the hand with a beefy-red expanding margin and red streaks extending up the arm . The axillary lymph nodes are palpable and tender . Which of the following is the most likely pathogen? A) Bacteroides fragilis F) Enterococcus faecalis B) Clostridium difficile G) Escherichia coli C) Clostridium perfringens H) Staphylococcus epidermidis D) Clostridium tetani I) Streptococcus pneumoniae E) Enterobacter cloacae J) Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) J. Correct Answer: Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A) and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common causes of bacterial lymphadenitis. Cutaneous erythema and swelling at a site of inoculation, with streaking along lymphatic drainage territories and associated tender lymphadenopathy is characteristic of lymphadenitis. Bartonella henselae is another bacterial cause of lymphadenitis related to cat scratches ('Cat scratch disease'), although given the patient's injury secondary to a construction-related laceration, Streptococcus pyogenes lymphadenitis is more likely.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Bacteroides fragilis is a normal component of the gastrointestinal microbiota. It only results in infections when displaced from the colon such as following surgery or trauma where it has the potential to cause bacteremia, intra-abdominal infections, peritonitis, and subcutaneous abscesses. Clostridium difficile (Choice B) is an opportunistic infection that most commonly occurs following antibiotic alterations of the colonic microbiome. It can present with watery or bloody diarrhea depending on the severity of the infection. Clostridium perfringens (Choice C) can result in myonecrosis (gas gangrene) following traumatic injury. Its spores can also survive in undercooked food, and if ingested, can result in food poisoning. Clostridium tetani (Choice D) is the bacterial cause of tetanus, resulting in the development of spastic paralysis following inoculation via a penetrating traumatic wound. Enterobacter cloacae (Choice E) is a gram-negative rod that can result in a variety of diseases such as urinary tract infection, pneumonia, skin and soft-tissue infections, endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, ophthalmic infections, and bacteremia. It is not a common cause of lymphadenitis. Enterococcus faecalis (Choice F) is found in normal colonic flora but may result in urinary or biliary tract infections, or subacute endocarditis following gastrointestinal or genitourinary invasive procedures. Escherichia coli (Choice G) is a gram-negative rod with multiple strains presenting with different clinical symptoms. These range from the watery diarrhea of enterotoxigenic E. coli to bloody diarrhea and dysentery in enteroinvasive and enterohemorrhagic E. coli. Additionally, E. coli is a common cause of urinary tract infections such as cystitis and pyelonephritis. Staphylococcus epidermidis (Choice H) is a normal flora of the skin and nose. It can be associated with intravascular catheter and joint prosthesis infections. Streptococcus pneumoniae (Choice I) is a gram-positive diplococcus associated with otitis media, pneumonia, sinusitis, and meningitis. It does not typically cause lymphadenitis. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 45 of 50 'I 45 . A 63-year-old man has had dysphagia and chest pain during meals for 4 months . He has a 6-year history of gastroesophageal reflux . He has limited his intake to liquids for 3 weeks because he regurgitates solid food . Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms? A) Disordered neuromuscular transmission in the esophagus B) Disordered neuromuscular transmission in the oropharynx C) Failure of oropharyngeal propulsion D) Paraesophageal hiatal hernia E) Stricture of the distal esoi:ihagus Correct Answer: E. A stricture of the distal esophagus is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The patient presents with chronic solid-food dysphagia and chest pain following multiple years of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERO). Chronic GERO, especially if under-managed, raises the risk for development of a distal esophageal stricture. The chronic exposure of the distal esophagus to reflux of gastric acid results in recurrent inflammation leading to potential fibrosis and strictures. Esophageal strictures characteristically present with solid-food dysphagia and regurgitation since the decreased esophageal luminal diameter impedes the passage of solid foods worse than liquid foods. Chronic GERO increases the patient's risk for development of Barrett esophagus (intestinal metaplasia) and esophageal adenocarcinoma, which should be considered in the patient's management and diagnostic evaluation. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Disordered neuromuscular transmission in the esophagus (Choice A) refers to achalasia, which is a type of esophageal dysmotility disorder resulting from deficient peristalsis along the length of the esophagus and impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. It manifests as dysphagia to both solids and liquids, odynophagia, weight loss, halitosis, and regurgitation of undigested food. It is diagnosed through a barium swallow plus esophageal manometry. Disordered neuromuscular transmission in the oropharynx (Choice B) and failure of oropharyngeal propulsion (Choice C) typically occur from impaired cranial nerve function. Oropharyngeal motility is dictated by the coordinated movement of several muscles (e.g., palate, tongue, pharynx), which are primarily innervated by the facial nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve, vagus nerve, and hypoglossal nerve. Underlying neurologic dysfunction (e.g., stroke) can result in incoordination of the oropharyngeal muscles, which can present as transfer dysphagia related to difficulty propelling the food bolus from the oropharynx to the hypopharynx and esophagus. Paraesophageal hiatal hernia (Choice D) results from protrusion of the gastric fundus through the esophageal diaphragmatic hiatus. The gastroesophageal junction remains in its normal location. This can result in obstructive symptoms as the herniated gastric fundus exerts mass effect on the adjacent distal esophagus. The patient demonstrates risk factors for a reflux-associated distal esophageal stricture, which is more common. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 46 of 50 'I 46 . A 57-year-old man comes to the physician because of persistent increasingly severe left-sided chest pain for 1 month . He works as an industrial engineer . Examination shows absent breath sounds and dullness to percussion over the lower portion of the left hemithorax . An x-ray of the chest shows a left-sided pleural effusion with an extensive peripheral soft-tissue density . Thoracentesis shows a bloody, exudative effusion ; cultures are negative . Cytology of pleural fluid shows malignant cells of uncertain type . An open biopsy specimen shows a dimorphic picture ; there are areas of spindle cells with numerous mitotic figures and areas of cuboidal epithelial cells . Exposure to which of the following agents is the most likely cause of his condition? A) Asbestos B) Nickel C) Talc D) Tobacco E) Toluene diisocyanate Correct Answer: A. Asbestos exposure commonly occurs in the setting of roofing, plumbing, and shipbuilding. It increases the risk for pulmonary asbestosis, characterized by the development of pleural calcified plaques and potential lower-lobe-predominant interstitial fibrotic changes. It also increases the risk for the development of bronchogenic carcinoma and mesothelioma. The patient presents with a left-sided pleural effusion with extensive peripheral soft-tissue density and cytology of the pleural fluid demonstrating malignant cells. Biopsy shows spindle cells with numerous mitotic figures. This presentation and associated x-ray and pathologic findings are typical for pleural mesothelioma. Mesothelioma often presents with pleural soft-tissue thickening and an exudative, often hemorrhagic, pleural effusion. Asbestos exposure is the main risk factor for mesothelioma, while smoking tobacco is not an associated risk factor. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E.",
        "B": "Nickel exposure is a common cause of contact dermatitis, which is a T-lymphocyte mediated type IV hypersensitivity reaction that results in an erythematous, pruritic rash in the location of exposure.",
        "C": "Infarction of the skin can occur in the setting of protein C or S deficiency after the administration of warfarin. During the initiation of warfarin, the potential for a hypercoagulable state exists, especially in patients with protein C or S deficiency. This can result in warfarin-associated skin necrosis characterized by patches of necrotic skin, not ulcerations.",
        "D": "Necrobiosis lipoidica is a rare dermatologic condition that often affects the shins. It is a chronic granulomatous skin disease that is associated with diabetes mellitus. It typically presents with reddish or violaceous papules that progress to yellow-brown telangiectatic plaques. Ulceration of the lesions can occur. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 50 of 50"

        "A": "results from a mismatch between donor and recipient blood groups, caused by native recipient immunoglobulins against the donor antigen. AHTR can be life threatening because of hemolysis, end-stage kidney disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and hypotension. Diagnosis is based on the history and laboratory workup for hemolysis plus type mismatch; treatment begins with immediate discontinuation of the transfusion. Anaphylactic transfusion reaction (Choice B) occurs when transfused blood contains an antigen against which the recipient has preformed lgE antibodies, leading to a rapid and severe type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction with diffuse mast cell degranulation and histamine release. Symptoms include flushing, itching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, angioedema, and in severe cases, airway obstruction and distributive shock. Classically, anaphylactic transfusion reactions are seen in recipients with lgA deficiency when they receive lgA fragments in donated blood. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) (Choice C) occurs because of the recipient developing antibodies against donor antigens generally occurring 1 to 10 days following transfusion. Hemolysis, with resultant anemia, jaundice, and fatigue may occur. In general, DHTR symptoms are much milder than the symptoms of AHTR, and end-stage kidney disease, DIC, and hypotension are less common. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (Choice E) generally occurs within 6 hours of a blood transfusion. It is a serious complication that is characterized by noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Symptoms include fever, dyspnea, severe hypoxemia, and shock. It more frequently occurs following a transfusion of platelets or plasma and is hypothesized to be immune-mediated. r , \" , F' Exam Section : Item 2 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cholangiocarcinoma, a malignancy of the bile ducts, characteristically presents late in its course with signs of biliary tree obstruction, including abdominal discomfort, weight loss, nausea, jaundice, and pruritus. Patients may report dark urine or light, pale stools. Many persons have no risk factors; however, those with a history of cirrhosis, sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis B or C, liver fluke infection, and ulcerative colitis may be at increased risk. Diagnosis occurs through imaging of the abdomen with CT scan or MRI, which may disclose a variety of findings from bile duct wall thickening, a focal mass, or only dilation of bile ducts proximal to the presumed lesion location. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) allows for the potential direct visualization of the lesion location, bile duct scrapings or biopsy for definitive diagnosis, and stenting of any associated occlusion. Laboratory analysis typically discloses obstructive (direct) hyperbilirubinemia and increased alkaline phosphatase activity. Treatment includes surgical resection and chemotherapy; however, the condition is often late-stage or terminal at the time of diagnosis. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Measurement of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration (Choice A) is sometimes increased in cholangiocarcinoma; however, it is nonspecific and is also increased in colorectal carcinoma along with other various malignancies. It may be followed during treatment to assess treatment response but does not have a specific role in diagnosis. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA scan) (Choice C) evaluates the patency of the hepatobiliary tree and gallbladder. It is useful in cases of suspected acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, or biliary obstruction with indeterminate ultrasonography findings. It does not permit tissue sampling such as biopsy or therapeutic interventions such as stenting. Liver biopsy (Choice D) is useful in the diagnosis of conditions such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, though cholangiocarcinoma is generally small and confined to the biliary tree. These features may result in false negative liver biopsy results and should prompt targeted sampling via ERCP. Exploratory laparotomy (Choice E) involves the surgical evaluation of the peritoneal cavity and is commonly employed in the diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma, bowel obstruction, peritonitis, and undifferentiated cases of an acute abdomen.

It is classically worse with a straight-leg raise maneuver, which stretches the lumbar root and elicits radicular pain, often described as \"shooting down the leg.\" Osteoarthritis of the knee (Choice C) is common in older persons and those with obesity. Pain with osteoarthritis of the knee classically occurs in the knee joint itself and would be unlikely to radiate to the groin or thigh. It may also be associated with knee joint instability. Rheumatoid arthritis of the hip (Choice D) typically is worse in the morning (after a period of rest) with prolonged joint stiffness and improves with use. Extra-articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis may also be present such as rheumatoid nodules, pulmonary fibrosis, vasculitis, Sjogren syndrome, and dermatologic manifestations. Trochanteric bursitis (Choice E) presents with localized pain and swelling, often with overlying erythema in the area of the affected bursa. A common risk factor is prolonged pressure applied to the bursa. The associated pain generally does not radiate. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 5 of 50 'I"

BRCA 1 expression is low in the majority of high-grade, ductal breast and epithelial ovarian cancers. BRCA 1 plays an important role in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks, and absent or low-expression of this protein promotes mutations which may eventually lead to malignancy. In families with a strong history of early breast and/or ovarian malignancy, with a known BRCA 1 mutation, the risk for breast or ovarian cancer in women can be decreased through a bilateral mastectomy and oophorectomy.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) in the setting of hemodynamic stability is best evaluated using a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. BAT is commonly associated with injury involving the liver, spleen, and kidneys, and can include hematomas, contusions, lacerations, and in severe cases, devascularization and uncontrolled hemorrhage. Hematuria is highly suggestive of renal or retroperitoneal bleeding or hematoma. In contrast to stable BAT, hemodynamically unstable BAT is evaluated first with focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) followed by an exploratory laparotomy if positive, whereas stable BAT permits time for more thorough evaluation and the additional detail offered in a CT scan. Patients should also receive intravenous fluids, pain control, and supportive care as needed. There should be close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamics, as decompensation may occur rapidly if bleeding is present or continues unabated.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Measurement of serum creatinine concentration has a role in the evaluation of renal function following BAT but would not have an immediate role in the evaluation of a traumatic renal injury until such an injury is identified on a CT scan.",
        "C": "Cystography and cystoscopy (Choice E) have roles in the workup of hematuria when a bladder source is suspected. Retrograde urethrography (Choice D) permits evaluation of the urethra as a source of hematuria. However, in undifferentiated cases of BAT, a CT scan permits evaluation of the liver, spleen, kidneys, ureters, retroperitoneum, bladder, bony pelvis, and prostate, and should precede dedicated bladder or urethral imaging. Exploratory laparotomy (Choice F) is the correct choice in the management of unstable BAT, as it permits the control of hemorrhage and the repair of identified injuries. In stable cases, imaging precedes surgical intervention. r \" , r-- r , 'I 11 . A 27-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 6-day history of right flank pain that radiates to her right groin . She is otherwise asymptomatic . She has a 6-year history of Crohn disease and has undergone three resections of the small bowel , mostly involving the distal ileum , as well as resection of the right colon . Current medications include mesalamine , folic acid , and a daily multivitamin . Her temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F) , pulse is 100/min , respirations are 16/min , and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows a well-healed surgical scar at the midline and mild tenderness of the right flank . A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows a calculus in the middle of the right ureter. Which of the following is the most likely precipitating mechanism of this patient's current condition? A) Excessive intake of calcium and vitamin D B) Hyperparathyroidism C) Increased absorption of oxalate D) Increased secretion of cystine E) Increased secretion of uric acid Correct Answer: C. Nephrolithiasis or ureterolithiasis describes the formation of calculi within the urinary collecting system, otherwise known as kidney or ureteral calculi. Calcium oxalate calculi are the most common type (making up generally 80% of all urinary tract calculi), though calcium phosphate, struvite, uric acid, and proteinaceous calculi (e.g., cystine) are also seen. Crohn disease is a common risk factor for oxalate calculi. It results in increased gastrointestinal absorption of oxalates, leading to an increased serum concentration and increased urinary excretion. When paired with a calcium counterion, oxalates precipitate in the urine and may lead to calculi formation. Symptoms of kidney or ureteral calculi include colicky flank pain radiating to the groin, gross hematuria, and difficulty voiding. Complications include obstructive hydronephrosis, post-renal azotemia, and superimposed infection such as pyelonephritis. Diagnosis is through noncontrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. Treatment varies depending on the size, location, and complicating features. Small, uncomplicated calculi often pass without intervention, whereas large, obstructing, or infected calculi may require antibiotics, surgical removal, ureteral stenting, or percutaneous nephrostomy. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E. Excessive intake of calcium and vitamin D (Choice A) can promote the development of urinary tract calculi as calcium is frequently the precipitant counterion to oxalate in urine. The amount of calcium absorbed from the patient's use of a daily multivitamin would be unlikely to supply a sufficient concentration to cause hypercalcemia.",
        "D": "Increased secretion of cystine is a potential mechanism for nephrolithiasis and is generally hereditary. The mechanism relates to impaired cystine resorption in the proximal convoluted tubule, which results in cystinuria. Cystine is poorly soluble and precipitates easily into calculi. The condition generally presents in childhood and would be unlikely to manifest initially in an adult patient with known Crohn disease. Increased secretion of uric acid (Choice E) occurs most commonly in states of decreased urine volume and dry climates; increased pH also promotes uric acid precipitation. Urate calculi are associated with hyperuricemia (e.g., gout) and are also common in cases of increased cell turnover (e.g., tumor lysis syndrome). r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 12 of 50 'I"

Vital signs may show hypertension or hypotension depending on cardiac function. If left heart failure ensues, signs and symptoms of pulmonary edema such as shortness of breath, cough, tachypnea, hypoxia, and crackles may be present. If right heart failure occurs, peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, ascites, jugular venous distention, and hypotension may be present. ST-segment elevations in leads 11, Ill, and a VF suggest an inferior wall myocardial infarction, which classically occurs from occlusion of the right coronary artery. Cardiogenic shock is a potential complication. In cardiogenic shock, there is severe dysfunction of the cardiac myocytes, resulting in markedly decreased contractility. Pulmonary artery catheterization typically demonstrates decreased cardiac output and increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure because of the underlying systolic cardiac dysfunction. Systemic vascular resistance is commonly increased as a physiologic attempt to maintain mean arterial pressure in the setting of reduced cardiac output and peripheral perfusion.",

In young boys, such upregulation of androgens presents with precocious puberty, while in women it presents with masculinization (e.g., amenorrhea, hirsutism, temporal balding, acne, deepening of the voice, clitoromegaly).

As a result, patients often splint their breathing, resulting in bradypnea and low tidal volume, which will decrease alveolar minute ventilation leading to the development of hypoxemia and acute respiratory acidosis. Underlying respiratory impairment (e.g., history of smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) may further exacerbate hypoventilation. Vital signs may disclose bradypnea and low arterial oxygen saturation. Physical examination will demonstrate diminished respiratory effort, often with reduced breath sounds at the lung bases because of atelectasis and inadequate diaphragmatic excursion. Arterial blood gas analysis may disclose an acidic pH with increases in both Pco and HCO along with low arterial oxygen -, 2 3 tension. Hypoxemia will improve with the administration of supplemental oxygen, whereas hypercapnia will persist until the resolution of ventilatory insufficiency. Pain control, incentive spirometry, and respiratory therapy with lung expansion maneuvers are key initial steps in management.",

Increased metabolic demands (Choice D) generally result in increased minute ventilation. The respiratory system compensates for the increased production of carbon dioxide and organic acids through increased ventilation. Increased physiologic dead space (Choice E) may occur in cases where the alveolar membrane no longer functions correctly or is not appropriately perfused (e.g., pulmonary embolism).

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Congenital heart disease is often subdivided into cyanotic and noncyanotic types depending on the direction of blood shunting. Structural heart defects that result in flow of deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary to systemic circulations (a right-to-left shunt) classically present with cyanosis, respiratory distress, hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension generally within 1 to 7 days after birth. Common culprit lesions include truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great vessels, tricuspid atresia, tetralogy of Fallo!, and total anomalous pulmonary venous return. These lesions require the concomitant presence of a left-to-right shunt (patent ductus arteriosus) to allow for a degree of blood oxygenation. Without a left-to-right shunt, a complete absence of oxygenation can occur because of the separated circulatory systems, which is incompatible with life. In cases of a suspected congenital cyanotic heart defect, intravenous prostaglandin should be started, which maintains a patent ductus arteriosus. Administration of indomethacin or similar nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medications should be avoided, as these will result in closure of the ductus arteriosus. Echocardiography is required to determine the structural defects to confirm the right-to-left shunt and to assist in operative planning.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "CT scan of the chest can provide structural but only limited functional information about the heart, whereas an echocardiography permits analysis of structural defects, pressure, velocity, and flow of blood which is important in understanding the hemodynamics associated with structural heart disease. Administration of indomethacin (Choice C) would result in closure of the ductus arteriosus and could worsen the degree of right-to-left shunting with resultant severe hypoxia. Administration of surfactant (Choice D) may have an adjunct role in certain cases of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome because of the inadequate production of surfactant in the setting of premature birth; however, the pulmonary function in congenital heart disease is often not affected. Cardiac catheterization (Choice E) may be necessary to further assist in evaluation of the heart anatomy and intracardiac pressures, but it is not the best next step, as echocardiography is often sufficient and does not require an invasive procedure. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 18 of 50 'I"

Risk factors include gallstones, biliary sludge, or conditions that slow or delay gastric emptying or reduce contractility of the gallbladder such as pregnancy or total parenteral nutrition. Diagnosis is through clinical history, physical examination, and ultrasonography, which may disclose pericholecystic fluid, a dilated gallbladder, gallbladder wall thickening and hyperemia, the presence of gallstones, and a sonographic Murphy sign (pain with compression directly over the gallbladder). Treatment involves surgical resection of the gallbladder {cholecystectomy). lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, E, and F. Abruptio placentae {Choice A) presents with vaginal bleeding, severe uterine pain, and tetanic contractions, typically in the third trimester. It commonly results from lower abdominal trauma, smoking, or cocaine use. Acute appendicitis {Choice B) presents with periumbilical pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant, fever, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and leukocytosis. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy {Choice D) presents with insidious right upper quadrant pain and tenderness, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and jaundice. In severe cases, liver function testing may disclose transaminitis, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and coagulopathy. Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome {Choice E) describes perihepatic inflammation secondary to pelvic inflammatory disease, often because of Neisseria or Chlamydia species. It does not directly affect the gallbladder. Severe preeclampsia {Choice F) presents with multisystem organ failure and is marked by severe hypertension, headaches, retinopathy, proteinuria, end-stage kidney disease, and liver failure. It may also present with hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 19 of 50",

        "A": "Colloid and isotonic crystalloid solution is incorrect as colloids are generally not deficient in the setting of burns (e.g., albumin). The administration of isotonic crystalloids alone is the standard of care for resuscitative fluid administration as it provides the most direct intravascular benefit. Fresh frozen plasma (Choice B) is appropriate for use as a resuscitation fluid in cases of severe blood loss as part of a balanced resuscitation treatment plan. It is also used in reversing anticoagulation when prothrombin complex concentrates are not available. It does not have a primary role in the fluid resuscitation of patients with burns. Hypertonic crystalloid solution only (Choice C) is used in the management of acute hyponatremia with neurologic deficits and to reduce cerebral edema in cases of elevated intracranial pressure. It does not have a primary role in the fluid resuscitation of patients with burns. Packed red blood cells (Choice E) are used as a component of resuscitation in cases of hemorrhagic shock.

Ovarian cancer classically presents late in the course and is often metastatic and invasive at the time of discovery. Presenting features are often nonspecific and may include weight loss, abdominal discomfort or distention, ascites, and gastrointestinal symptoms including early satiety, bloating, nausea, cramping, and bowel obstruction. Bowel obstruction can occur because of locally invasive disease or because of peritoneal carcinomatosis, which is often a common presenting diagnosis.

Ovarian cancer is also potentially hereditary, with an increased frequency of cases seen in women with mutations in BRCA 1/2 and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. Treatment includes surgical resection and debulking plus chemotherapy. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to maximize survival. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, E, and G. Colon cancer (Choice A) may present with symptoms of a bowel obstruction, especially if left-sided (descending colon). Classic symptoms of left-sided colon cancer include weight loss, tenesmus, constipation, narrow stools, and large bowel obstruction. Right-sided (ascending colon) lesions classically present with occult bleeding and iron deficiency anemia. Endometrial cancer (Choice B) classically arises in older women who have been chronically exposed to uninterrupted estrogen stimulation (e.g., obesity, nulliparity, using tamoxifen, using exogenous hormones). Any unexplained vaginal bleeding in a postmenopausal woman should be investigated, as endometrial carcinoma may be present. Gastric cancer (Choice C) classically presents with weight loss, early satiety, and melena in a patient with a history of smoking, peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis, or frequent consumption of nitrate-containing foods. Gastric outlet obstruction is a potential complication, which presents as nausea, left upper quadrant and epigastric discomfort, and nonbilious emesis containing partially digested food. Metastatic breast cancer (Choice D) most commonly spreads to the bone, lung, and brain, and would be less likely to present with omental and peritoneal metastases.

The mitral valve is the most commonly affected. Antibodies to M protein enhance host defenses against group A streptococci but can result in an autoimmune attack against self-antigens through molecular mimicry.

        "A": "Aortic stenosis presents with a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur that is heard best at the upper right sternal border and radiates to the carotid arteries. It classically occurs secondary to age-related fibrotic and calcific changes of the valve but can occur earlier in life in cases of bicuspid aortic valve or chronic rheumatic disease. Tetralogy of Fallo! (Choice C) consists of pulmonary infundibular stenosis, overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect, and right ventricular hypertrophy, resulting in a right-to-left shunt with cyanosis first noted in infancy. The murmur heard with Tetralogy of Fallo! relates to the underlying ventricular septal defect, characterized by a holosystolic murmur heard best in the lower left sternal border, and to the pulmonic stenosis, characterized by a systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur in the pulmonic listening area. Tricuspid regurgitation (Choice D) demonstrates a holosystolic murmur heard best in the lower left sternal border. The tricuspid valve is less commonly affected than the mitral or aortic valves in ARF. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) (Choice E) is characterized by a holosystolic murmur heard best in the lower left sternal border. VSD generally presents at birth and is not associated with ARF. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 23 of 50 'I"

To prevent further progression of the dissection flap, controlling the patient's heart rate and blood pressure is the first priority. An intravenous ~-adrenergic blocking agent should be used with a goal of decreasing the heart rate to approximately 60/min and the blood pressure to less than 100 to 120 mm Hg systolic and 60 to 80 mm Hg diastolic. Decreasing the heart rate helps prevent the advancement of the dissection flap and resultant occlusion of branch vessels by limiting the pulse pressure differential. Labetalol is a nonspecific adrenoreceptor blocker that targets both ar and ~radrenoreceptors, making it an ideal choice for the management of the patient's heart rate, cardiac contractility, and vascular resistance.",

Administration of nitroglycerin (Choice C) may be appropriate in cases of aortic dissection for blood pressure control if the goal is not met with adrenoreceptor blockade; however, it would follow administration of a ~ adrenergic blocking agent to prevent reflex tachycardia and widening of pulse pressure. Fiberoptic intubation (Choice D) may be appropriate for a patient with a compromised airway, but in cases without an impending threat to the airway would be superseded by management of the immediate life threatening condition, the patient's aortic dissection.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Venous insufficiency presents with dependent, pitting edema that improves with compression and elevation, along with paresthesia and hyperpigmentation of the skin (e.g., stasis dermatitis). In severe cases, chronic circulatory insufficiency can result in skin breakdown, leading to the development of open ulcers, classically along the medial aspect of the ankle. Venous insufficiency often results from deep venous thrombosis with resultant damage to the valves. When the thrombus resolves, the residual vessel may be dysfunctional from damage to the valve leaflets, valve annulus, or increased diameter of the native vessel. This prevents the vessel from functioning effectively and results in stagnant or retrograde venous flow secondary to gravity. Treatment includes wound care for the ulcer and measures to reverse the venous insufficiency such as optimizing venous return, diuresis, and improving circulatory function by optimizing cardiac, vascular, and kidney function.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) commonly presents with symptoms of hearing loss, vertigo, and ataxia, often slow in onset and progressive over a subacute to chronic period. Classically, these tumors occur at the cerebellopontine angle of the brain stem and are associated with neurofibromatosis. They may exert mass effect on cranial nerves within their proximity or invade the nerves from which they arise, often the facial nerve, vestibulocochlear nerve, or adjacent nerves. Facial nerve involvement manifests as facial asymmetry because of loss of skeletal muscle innervation and occasionally presents with diminished taste perception involving the ipsilateral anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Vestibulocochlear nerve palsy can present with diminished hearing or tinnitus (cochlear branch) on the ipsilateral side, and vertigo or ataxia may occur (vestibular branch) because of impaired proprioception from loss of input from the ipsilateral vestibule. In cases of larger masses, disruption of brain stem tracts and increased intracranial pressure can result.",

It may be caused by bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections. Cranial nerve deficits may result, but a chronic presentation involving cranial nerves only would be rare.",
        "D": "Otosclerosis results in dysfunction of the ossicles and causes conductive hearing loss; neurologic symptoms of ataxia would be unlikely. Pituitary adenoma (Choice E) can present with mass-like symptoms such as a headache or bitemporal hemianopsia, or with symptoms caused by the functional production of a hormone from the tumor (e.g., galactorrhea secondary to a prolactinoma). Because of the position of the pituitary gland within the sella turcica, symptoms involving the facial nerve or vestibulocochlear nerve would be unlikely. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 27 of 50 'I"

As the air accumulates within the space, the lung parenchyma becomes compressed, resulting in respiratory distress, reduced breath sounds, hyperresonance to percussion, and in severe cases, tension on the mediastinal structures impeding venous return resulting in hypotension. A spontaneous primary pneumothorax can occur in a tall, thin, young person because of the rupture of a pulmonary bleb, classically in a young athlete and often during physical exertion. Small pneumothoraces can be managed with serial examinations and repeat chest x-rays to confirm resolution. When the lesion is larger than 20 to 30% of the hemithoracic volume, a chest tube should be placed to evacuate the pneumothorax and reinflate the lung to prevent the development of a persistent or permanent pneumothorax. Tension pneumothorax should be immediately decompressed with emergent needle thoracostomy to prevent hemodynamic collapse.",

Asthma classically results in narrowing of the small airways. Pleural inflammation (Choice D) presents with pleuritic chest pain, often following a viral respiratory infection. Occasionally, a friction rub may be heard on auscultation, but often the examination and vital signs are unremarkable.

It typically presents following mastitis, with a localized region of indurated, fluctuant tissue. Breast cancer (Choice B) encompasses many types of breast carcinoma, including invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, inflammatory breast carcinoma, and cystosarcoma phyllodes. The most common type is invasive ductal carcinoma, which typically presents as a palpable, immobile breast mass, which may demonstrate features such as spiculated margins and microcalcifications on mammography. Malignancies can be associated with pathologic nipple discharge, although intraductal papilloma is the most common cause of unilateral bloody nipple discharge. Ductal ectasia (Choice C) more often occurs in perimenopausal women and is a widening of the lactiferous ducts with thickening of their walls, often near the nipple. Ectatic ducts are often asymptomatic until they become blocked, at which time they may become nodular or painful. Bloody discharge is uncommon. Fat necrosis (Choice D) is often detected in the breast as a palpable nodularity in an area of previous trauma. On imaging, peripheral calcifications are often seen.",

Examination often demonstrates generalized abdominal tenderness, sometimes worse in the right lower quadrant, and, depending on the severity and extent, may disclose complications such as enterocutaneous fistulas and extraintestinal manifestations such as uveitis. Severe Crohn disease can result in intestinal obstruction from stricture or inflammation, bowel perforation, intra-abdominal abscess, and the formation of additional fistulas. Diagnosis occurs through colonoscopy with biopsy, which is the best next step in the diagnosis of this patient. Laboratory analyses often disclose increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein concentration.

This is most commonly indicated for the evaluation of small bowel pathology, such as duodenal atresia, malrotation with volvulus, and Crohn disease; however, it would not offer the opportunity to sample tissue through biopsy. MRI of the abdomen (Choice C) offers high-contrast resolution detail of soft-tissue structures within the abdomen. It can be used for the evaluation of a variety of intra-abdominal pathologies. MRI enterography techniques can be utilized to investigate sites of active or chronic bowel inflammation, although this would not permit tissue sampling. Capsule endoscopy (Choice D) is used in the diagnosis of jejunal and proximal ileal pathology located outside of the reachable field of view of upper endoscopy or colonoscopy. It is most commonly used in the workup of small bowel sources of gastrointestinal bleeding or neoplasia. It offers images only and cannot be used for tissue sampling. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 31 of 50 'I 31 . A 66-year-old man with unresectable squamous cell lung cancer has the acute onset of severe shortness of breath. An x-ray of the chest shows a unilateral pleural effusion . The patient has been receiving hospice care at home. Which of the following management strategies is most consistent with the patient's preference for hospice care? A) Initiation of systemic chemotherapy B) Radiation therapy C) Open pleurodesis D) Thoracentesis E) Tracheostomy CorrectAnswer: D. Hospice care generally carries the goal of providing an improved quality of life for a patient when a terminal condition is present. While the criteria for hospice eligibility vary by state and sometimes by individual hospice organization, there are general universally agreed-upon conditions for eligibility such that a life-limiting condition must be present, often with a prognosis of 6 months or less to live. Additionally, frequent hospitalizations; progressive weight loss or failure to thrive; terminal malignancy; advanced dementia, Alzheimer type; end-stage kidney disease without dialysis or transplant; and end-stage heart, lung, or liver failure are often conditions for which hospice eligibility exists. In such cases, a focus is placed on the patient's goals of care related to quality of life, and procedures or medical treatments that would improve such quality are undertaken in lieu of those that would limit the quality of life or cause undue distress without changing prognosis. Thoracentesis in the setting of terminal lung cancer would improve the patient's respiratory status and comfort without adding undue risk for pain. This is an appropriate intervention for a patient with terminal lung cancer and a large, compromising pleural effusion. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Initiation of systemic chemotherapy (Choice A), radiation therapy (Choice B), open pleurodesis (Choice C), and tracheostomy (Choice E) would all add undue discomfort and suffering without altering the patient's prognosis. These are contraindicated in a hospice patient with a terminal malignancy. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 32 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Osteoporosis occurs because of the loss of bone mineral density. The condition results from the interplay of three possible mechanisms: failure to achieve peak bone density, increased bone resorption, and decreased new bone formation. The condition is often asymptomatic until a traumatic injury results in a fracture, most commonly involving the hip, distal radius, or vertebrae. Classically, serum calcium, vitamin D, and magnesium concentrations are within the reference ranges; however, calcium handling in the bloodstream is key in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Hypocalcemia and hypovitaminosis D both lead to increased concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which results in increased osteoclast activity and bone resorption. Low concentrations of vitamin D are also associated with increased concentrations of PTH even when serum calcium is within the reference range. The diagnosis of osteoporosis is made based on DEXA scan once the bone density falls below 2.5 standard deviations of the mean for a young adult. Treatment includes correcting any modifiable risk factors, supplementing calcium and vitamin D, weight-bearing exercise therapy, and the use of osteoclast inhibitors (e.g., bisphosphonates).",

        "A": "hydroxylase activity results in a low active vitamin D concentration in the setting of end-stage kidney disease because of loss of parenchymal cells that synthesize the enzyme and the resultant inability to convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form. A deficiency of this enzyme would be uncommon outside of a primary kidney disease. Nutritional deficiency of vitamin D is more likely when the precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration is low. Decreased thyroxine (T concentration (Choice B) presents with symptoms of hypothyroidism including weight gain, lethargy, fatigue, constipation, hair loss, and cold intolerance. Thyroid hormone promotes bone ) 4 mineral density; however, in the absence of additional symptoms of hypothyroidism, a deficiency of thyroxine is less likely. Increased calcitonin concentration (Choice C) classically presents with hypocalcemia, as calcitonin promotes osteoblast activity with resultant bone mineral deposition. Increased osteocalcin concentration (Choice D) is a marker of bone formation and is correlated with increases in bone mineral density, for example, when bone-forming medications such as teriparatide are used. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 36 of 50 'I"

Many people will develop some degree of valve stenosis because of chronic inflammation with resultant calcification and fibrosis over time, with the aortic valve most commonly affected. Structural abnormalities of the valve, such as a bicuspid aortic valve, alter the biomechanics of valve opening and closing, which increases the likelihood of earlier calcification and resultant stenosis because of increased mechanical trauma. Congenital bicuspid aortic valve classically presents with early signs and symptoms of aortic stenosis and left-sided diastolic heart failure. Patients may report fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, diminished exercise tolerance, or syncope with exertion. Examination findings include a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border, and pulsus parvus et tardus (weak and delayed) may be noted on examination of peripheral pulses. Because of the chronic increased afterload from a fixed obstruction by the valve, left ventricular hypertrophy and resultant diastolic dysfunction can occur.

        "B": "Formation of atherosclerotic plaque describes the principal risk factor for coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accidents, and peripheral artery disease. The presence of a plaque within the arterial wall acts as a nidus for thrombus formation when the plaque ruptures. This does not play a role in the development of aortic stenosis. Rupture of the chordae tendineae (Choice C) may occur following a myocardial infarction. It typically leads to acute valvular regurgitation and is classically associated with acute pulmonary edema from mitral regurgitation. Streptococcal infection (Choice D) is associated with rheumatic heart disease, which results in inflammation of the valves of the heart, most commonly the mitral and aortic valves. This may present with acute regurgitant murmurs and chronically can result in stenosis. This patient's bicuspid aortic valve is his main risk factor for early-onset aortic stenosis. Thrombus deposition on the valve (Choice E) is commonly seen in cases of mechanical valve replacement with subtherapeutic anticoagulation.

Leg pain that occurs following exertion and improves with rest is known as claudication and indicates the presence of peripheral vascular disease.

As demand falls during rest, the pain typically improves. Peripheral vascular disease is common among older men who smoke cigarettes and have a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia. Active exercise improves collateral vascularization, which allows for improved arterial oxygenated blood flow to the skeletal musculature and is the best initial step in treatment along with the mitigation of risk factors. Additional therapeutic options include cilostazol and surgical revascularization (e.g., bypass, stenting), which can be employed following exercise therapy.",

Vasodilator therapy (Choice D) (e.g., cilostazol) may have a role in treating this patient's claudication, but it will not promote collateral vascularization which improves long-term symptoms. Because of this, initial treatment with a regimented exercise program is recommended. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 39 of 50 'I"

        "A": "Anaplastic carcinoma is a rare, aggressive thyroid malignancy that invades local structures such as the esophagus and trachea. It generally only occurs in older persons and carries a poor prognosis. On examination, a \"hard, woody mass\" may be palpable along with symptoms of dysphagia or hoarseness. Follicular carcinoma (Choice B) also presents with a thyroid nodule and is the second most common thyroid malignancy after papillary carcinoma. It is diagnosed on biopsy, as the neoplastic cells are noted to invade the surrounding capsule, which differentiates it from a benign follicular adenoma. It typically carries a good prognosis. Hurthle cell adenoma (Choice C) is a less common type of benign thyroid adenoma arising from Hurthle cells. It most commonly occurs in older females. Papillary carcinoma (Choice E) is the most common type of thyroid cancer and carries an excellent prognosis. It typically demonstrates empty-appearing nuclei with central clearing, nuclear grooves, and psammoma bodies on histology.

A) Abdominal ultrasonography B) Administration of vitamin B (cyanocobalamin) and folic acid 12 C) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography D) Hemodialysis E) Paracentesis Correct Answer: E. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) occurs most frequently in cirrhotic states, although it can occur in any setting causing ascites. SBP describes an infection within ascitic fluid in the peritoneal cavity, most often from translocated enteric flora such as Escherichia coli. The classic presentation includes fever along with diffuse abdominal pain and tenderness in a patient with ascites. If there is clinical concern for SBP, the ascites fluid should be sampled through a paracentesis. Laboratory analysis of the ascitic fluid should include Gram stain, culture, and cell counts. A total leukocyte count of greater than 1000/mm 3 or greater than 250 neutrophils/mm 3 is generally diagnostic of SBP since culture results are variably positive. Antibiotics with gram-negative rod coverage (e.g., third-generation cephalosporins) are considered first-line. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Abdominal ultrasonography (Choice A) may provide detail as to the presence of ascites and the structural character of the liver. However, in cases with clear signs of liver failure and evidence of ascites on examination, it would delay sampling of the ascites fluid and administration of antibiotics. Administration of vitamin B (cyanocobalamin) and folic acid (Choice B) is important in the repletion of deficient cofactors and coenzymes as a result of the patient's chronic malnutrition. However, such repletion 12 should follow addressing more immediate infectious concerns from SBP. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (Choice C) is a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic intervention for the evaluation of the anatomy and patency of the hepatobiliary tree. It does not have an immediate role in the management of SBP.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency are associated with chronic pancreatitis and result from repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis leading to the destruction of acinar and islet cells. The loss of acinar and islet parenchyma can be further exacerbated if a distal pancreatectomy is performed to control symptoms or manage complications of chronic pancreatitis. The exocrine pancreas produces digestive enzymes, the absence of which leads to malnutrition (e.g., cachexia, muscle wasting), weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and frequent, loose, foul-smelling, sometimes oily stools (steatorrhea). The diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency is through clinical history, imaging, and biopsy. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is treated with oral pancreatic enzyme replacement such as pancrelipase. Endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, if present, typically results in diabetes mellitus, which requires insulin replacement therapy. Any modifiable inciting causes of pancreatitis (e.g., gallstones, alcohol use disorder, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia) should be mitigated to delay disease progression and preserve remaining native pancreatic function.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Cephalocele defines a protrusion of intracranial contents through a defect in the skull, typically covered by skin and dura. They do not classically appear vascular or expand with time. Fat necrosis (Choice B) generally results from a traumatic injury involving adipose tissue and appears erythematous, nodular, and often demonstrates calcifications on imaging. Lesions do not typically persist or expand over time. Lymphatic hypertrophy (Choice C) presents with enlarged lymph nodes or lymphedema and characteristically presents without erythema, except in cases of lymphangitis or chronic dermatitis. Malignant transformation (Choice D) describes the conversion of a benign lesion to a state of malignancy with the potential for metastasis and invasion, which is rare in hemangiomas. Retention cyst (Choice E) describes a benign lesion that arises when a gland is unable to excrete its product, for example, a mucous retention cyst in the oral cavity, or a sebaceous cyst of the skin. Their growth is typically slow and generally not accompanied by symptoms apart from the presence of the lesion. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 46 of 50 'I 46 . A 62-year-old man with alcoholism comes to the emergency department because he has vomited bright red blood three times during the past 6 hours . His pulse is 130/min , and blood pressure is 90/40 mm Hg. He becomes dizzy when he sits up. Abdominal examination shows marked distention, shifting dullness , and a fluid wave . Upper endoscopy shows esophageal varices and an ulcer with a blood clot on a visible vessel located on the posterior wall of the first part of the duodenum . Which of the following is the most appropriate next step? A) Intravenous administration of ADH (vasopressin) B) Intravenous administration of esmolol C) Intravenous fluid therapy and blood transfusion D) Endoscopic-guided sclerosis of the esophageal varices E) Placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portal shunt Correct Answer: C. Tachycardia and hypotension in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding is diagnostic of decompensated hemorrhagic shock, for which the appropriate immediate treatment includes intravenous fluid therapy and blood transfusion, regardless of the underlying cause of blood loss. Alcohol use disorder promotes the formation of gastric and duodenal ulcers through mucosal irritation and gastritis. If an ulcer erodes through the mucosa and submucosa, marked bleeding can occur from the underlying vessels. Posterior duodenal ulcers are often associated with erosion into the gastroduodenal artery. If bleeding is not promptly addressed with fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion, and endoscopic or surgical control, rapid exsanguination and death can result. Treatment should also include administration of an intravenous proton pump inhibitor. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E. Intravenous administration of ADH (vasopressin) (Choice A) would not take the place of immediate fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion in a patient with blood loss, tachycardia, and hypotension. It no longer has a recognized role in the immediate management of gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. Intravenous administration of esmolol (Choice B) may worsen the hemodynamics of a patient with hemorrhagic shock and is contraindicated, as it blocks beta-adrenergic receptors resulting in decreased heart rate and myocardial contractility, which in turn decreases cardiac output. In cases of hemorrhagic shock, mean arterial pressure is maintained by systemic vascular resistance and heart rate; stroke volume is often dramatically diminished because of low preload in the setting of blood loss. Endoscopic-guided sclerosis of the esophageal varices (Choice D) is incorrect, as the patient's hemorrhagic shock is secondary to a bleeding duodenal ulcer, not esophageal varices. Any active variceal bleeding would have been noted during the upper endoscopy. Placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portal shunt (Choice E) is used in the prevention of variceal bleeding by decreasing portal venous pressure. It does not have an immediate role in the management of a bleeding duodenal ulcer. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 47 of 50 'I 47 . A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of episodes of headache , sweating , and rapid heartbeat. She has not had weight loss or chest pain. She has a 10-year history of hypertension that has been difficult to control despite trials of different drug classes . There is no family history of cancer. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 100/min , respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 172/105 mm Hg. Examination shows no other abnormalities . A 24-hour urine collection shows increased catecholamine and metanephrine concentrations . An MRI of the abdomen shows a 4-cm enhancing mass in the right adrenal gland . Surgical excision of the mass is scheduled . Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy to prepare this patient for surgical removal of the adrenal mass? A) Atropine B) Methylprednisolone C) Phenoxybenzamine D) Propranolol E) Sodium nitroprusside Correct Answer: C. Pheochromocytoma presents with episodic headaches, sweating, palpitations, tremors, agitation, tachycardia, tachypnea, and treatment-refractory hypertension. It is the most common tumor of the adrenal medulla, and is marked by the functional secretion of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine, which causes episodic hyperadrenergic symptoms. Physical examination may disclose diaphoresis, tremor, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hyperthermia during a symptomatic episode, and may be normal otherwise. Diagnosis is through laboratory evaluation and imaging studies. Laboratory evaluation may disclose increased urine and plasma catecholamines and metanephrines. Imaging studies may disclose a tumor within the adrenal gland, though 10% are extra-adrenal. Treatment includes a-adrenergic blocker such as phenoxybenzamine, an irreversible inhibitor, followed by 13-adrenergic blocker before resection. Failure to administer appropriate antiadrenergic therapy may result in hypertensive crisis or tachydysrhythmia at the time of resection. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E.",
        "B": "Methylprednisolone is a glucocorticoid with trace mineralocorticoid activity used in the management of allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, multiple sclerosis, and many other rheumatologic, autoimmune, infectious, and neoplastic conditions. It does not have an immediate role in the direct management of pheochromocytoma.",
        "D": "Propranolol is a nonspecific 13-adrenergic blocker used in the management of panic disorder, social phobia, essential tremor, thyrotoxicosis, tachyarrhythmias, migraines, and portal venous hypertension. It previously had a role in the management of hypertension, angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction, but is no longer a first-line medication for these conditions. It has a potential role in the management of pheochromocytoma but should follow a-adrenergic blocker. Sodium nitroprusside (Choice E) is an intravenous, titratable vasodilator used in the management of hypertensive emergencies; however, it may result in reflex tachycardia in the setting of pheochromocytoma. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 48 of 50 'I 48 .

Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun . His stool output is 5 Lover the next 24 hours ; his stool potassium concentration is increased . Serum studies show a pH of 7.56 and a potassium concentration of 2.8 mEq/L. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a pancreatic mass . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Gastrinoma B) Glucagonoma C) lnsulinoma D) Somatostatinoma E) VIPoma Correct Answer: E. VIPoma is a rare tumor often associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia that produces vasoactive intestinal peptide {VIP). Through its physiologic mechanism of action, VIP causes chronic and profound watery diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypercalcemia), achlorhydria, alkalosis, flushing, and vasodilation. This syndrome is often termed WDHA syndrome (watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, achlorhydria). Diagnostic evaluation includes imaging of the abdomen with CT scan or MRI, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, or PET scan to assist in localization of the tumor, and biopsy for tissue evaluation. Treatment includes correction of the associated fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base derangements, along with surgery and/or chemotherapy. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Gastrinoma {Choice A) is associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, the constellation of findings stemming from a gastrin-secreting tumor. It results in excessive production of acid by the gastric parietal cells. This can lead to recurrent, chronic duodenal or jejunal ulcers, which can present with abdominal pain, diarrhea secondary to malabsorption, and possible hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. Glucagonoma {Choice B) is a rare functional malignancy that secretes glucagon, which increases serum glucose concentration. Symptoms are nonspecific and include mild diabetes mellitus, paraneoplastic rash (e.g., necrolytic migratory erythema), and weight loss. lnsulinoma {Choice C) is a rare neoplasm of pancreatic islet cells that functionally produces insulin in a dysregulated manner. Insulin is produced even in periods of hypoglycemia. Patients present with symptoms of hypoglycemia, which are generally neuroglycopenic (agitation, headache, blurry vision, diplopia, tremor), autonomic {diaphoresis, tremoring, nausea, vomiting, cramping, tachycardia, anxiety), and nonspecific (fatigue, weakness, lethargy), and are often exacerbated by periods of fasting or exercise. Somatostatinoma {Choice D) is an uncommon neuroendocrine malignancy that presents with weight loss, mild diabetes mellitus, steatorrhea caused by limited cholecystokinin release, and achlorhydria from inhibition of gastrin. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 49 of 50 'I 49 . A previously healthy 37-year-old man comes to the physician because of blurred vision for 2 weeks . His blood pressure is 130/85 mm Hg. Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes . Funduscopic examination shows slightly pale optic discs . Visual field testing shows bitemporal hemianopia . The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Basilar artery aneurysm B) Cavernous sinus thrombosis C) Craniopharyngioma D) Optic nerve glioma E) Pituitary adenoma Correct Answer: E. Pituitary adenoma is associated with bitemporal hemianopsia because of its proximity to the optic chiasm. The nasal (medial) retina receives light entering the eye from temporal (lateral) sources. The fibers from this area of the retina travel within the medial aspect of the optic nerve, and then cross at the optic chiasm to form the optic tract within the contralateral brain. Damage to these fibers anywhere along their course will prevent the patient from perceiving images projected on the retina from the temporal field of view. Classically, patients report poor peripheral vision and a resultant inability to walk or drive as they cannot see things lateral to their bodies. The optic chiasm sits directly superior to the sella turcica, and pituitary adenomas may grow superiorly, compressing the chiasm resulting in loss of a patient's bilateral temporal field of view. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D. Basilar artery aneurysms (Choice A), when small and unruptured, may be asymptomatic. In cases of rupture or thrombosis, the posterior intracranial circulation may be affected, and patients can present with headache, cranial nerve deficits, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, and ataxia. Cavernous sinus thrombosis (Choice B) classically follows an infection or injury involving a structure drained by the cavernous sinus (e.g., sinusitis), and results in cranial nerve deficits involving those that traverse the cavernous sinus (oculomotor, trochlear, trigeminal, and abducens nerves). Classic symptoms include ipsilateral orbit pain, proptosis, periorbital edema, and impairment in extraocular movement, pupil reactivity, or symmetry.",
        "C": "Craniopharyngioma is a tumor seen in the sella turcica derived from remnants of Rathke pouch. It is the most common supratentorial tumor in childhood, although it is much less common than pituitary adenomas in adults. When large, they can compress the optic chiasm and cause bitemporal hemianopsia. Optic nerve glioma (Choice D) typically presents with unilateral vision loss or an afferent pupillary defect. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 50 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The inhalation of orogastric contents is known as aspiration, and it can occur from simple fluids such as water or stomach contents such as emesis or regurgitated products. Small volume, simple fluid aspiration may be resorbed by the lung without any consequence of infection, irritation, or compromised gas exchange. In other cases, large volume aspiration may sufficiently impair gas exchange resulting in refractory hypoxia. The aspiration of acidic stomach contents may cause aspiration pneumonitis, whereas the aspiration of gastrointestinal flora and additional bacteria can cause aspiration pneumonia. The volume of aspirate is the strongest predictor of complications from aspiration, especially in the case of pneumonia, as the bacterial inoculum may overwhelm the native ability of the pulmonary alveolar defenses (macrophages, cilia, mucus) to prevent colonization, replication, and infection. Aspiration pneumonia classically presents with cough productive of foul-smelling sputum, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, and rhonchi on examination. Imaging classically shows an infiltrate in the most dependent segments of lung at the time of aspiration (e.g., in the superior segment of the inferior lobe when supine or lower lobes when erect), and treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics with sufficient coverage of oral flora, gram-negative rods, and anaerobes.",

Typical organisms include Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Presence of solid material in the aspirate (Choice C) increases the risk for airway obstruction and atelectasis following aspiration, and also increases the risk for pneumonia, but to a lesser extent than the overall volume of aspiration fluid. Use of prophylactic antibiotics preoperatively (Choice D) is indicated to prevent skin and soft-tissue infections, contamination from the operative incision, sepsis, and peritonitis in the case of intra-abdominal surgery. r \" , r-- r ,"

Testicular torsion occurs when the testicle twists on the spermatic cord, resulting in subsequent insufficient testicular blood supply.

On physical examination, the testicle typically demonstrates an abnormal lie (e.g., transverse), extreme tenderness to palpation, absent cremasteric reflex, and pain that does not improve with elevation of the scrotum (as it does in epididymitis). The diagnosis is often clinical, though in cases of uncertainty, evaluation begins with ultrasonography, which delineates testicular size, sonographic features, blood flow, and epididymal anatomy. Management requires immediate surgical exploration of the scrotum with detorsion of the spermatic cord followed by bilateral orchiopexy to prevent future testicular torsion.",

On examination, pericarditis demonstrates a diastolic friction rub, described as a harsh sound heard in diastole. The condition is diagnosed clinically and supported by increased inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. If not treated, pericarditis can lead to the development of pericardia! effusions, which, if large and quickly accumulating, can result in cardiac tamponade. An echocardiography should be performed to assess for the presence of a pericardia! effusion, which may require pericardiocentesis for drainage if large.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Aortic atheroembolism, also known as cholesterol embolization syndrome, occurs secondary to embolization of atherosclerotic plaque contents (e.g., cholesterol crystals) from a proximal large artery (e.g., aorta) to distal small arteries and arterioles. This results in occlusion of the distal arterial vasculature with small cholesterol emboli, which induces a localized inflammatory response and end-organ damage. Dermatologic manifestations of this phenomenon are localized petechiae, livedo reticularis, and blue toe syndrome. Risk factors for cholesterol embolization syndrome include trauma and interventional procedures that increase the risk for damage and dislodgement of atherosclerotic plaques, such as cardiac catheterization (e.g., damage to atherosclerotic plaques of the thoracic and abdominal aorta via a femoral artery approach). Cholesterol emboli can also involve other organs, resulting in renal failure, colonic ischemia, cerebrovascular accidents, and skeletal muscle ischemia.",

Incompetent venous valves (Choice C) can result in chronic venous insufficiency, commonly following deep venous thrombosis, referred to as post-thrombotic syndrome. Patients present with chronic, recurrent limb edema, discoloration, pain, varicose veins, and, if severe, venous ulcers. Systemic vasculitis (Choice D) refers to generalized inflammation of the blood vessels.

If the carcinoma is located within the lung apex, referred to as a Pancoast tumor, it can infiltrate multiple adjacent structures such as the superior vena cava, subclavian vessels, sympathetic chain, recurrent laryngeal nerve, or brachia! plexus. This can result in presenting features of Horner syndrome (unilateral ptosis, miosis, and anhydrosis of the face), ipsilateral shoulder and upper extremity pain, and hoarseness. If the Pancoast tumor involves the right lung apex, superior vena cava syndrome may occur, which manifests with bilateral upper extremity and facial swelling, erythema, and vascular congestion caused by insufficient venous drainage from mass effect or vessel invasion.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Corticosteroid therapy is the most appropriate treatment for a patient presenting with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) related to an underlying intracranial metastasis. The most common intracranial tumor is a metastatic lesion from an extracranial primary malignancy. The cerebellum is a common location for metastases, along with the gray-white matter junction of the supratentorial brain. Cerebellar metastases typically present as a headache and symptoms of cerebellar dysfunction, such as gait disturbance, limb discoordination, and dizziness. Metastases to the brain are associated with significant vasogenic edema. This edema can lead to abnormal enlargement of the cerebellum, which can impress upon the fourth ventricle and foramina of Magendie and Luschka. This can result in the development of obstructive hydrocephalus and increased ICP. Increased ICP presents as nonspecific symptoms of altered mental status, stupor, vomiting, seizures, and blurry vison. Papilledema refers to optic disc swelling seen on funduscopic examination of the eyes and is secondary to increased intracranial pressure. The administration of intravenous corticosteroids assists in reducing metastasis-associated vasogenic edema, limiting its mass effect and risk for the development of obstructive hydrocephalus and increased ICP.",

        "B": "Anticoagulation therapy is typically used in the prophylaxis or therapeutic management of thromboembolic disease. The patient presents with symptoms of metastasis-associated increased ICP, for which anticoagulation would not be beneficial. As well, anticoagulation may increase the risk for hemorrhage associated with the site of metastasis. Vigorous hydration (Choice C) is not indicated, as the patient does not present with symptoms of hypovolemia. Excess hydration may also promote cerebral edema and worsen the patient's ICP. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (Choice D) evaluates its composition and is indicated in suspected meningitis, encephalitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and other central nervous system diseases (e.g., Guillain Barre syndrome, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, multiple sclerosis). Lumbar puncture is contraindicated in the setting of increased ICP because of the risk for herniation.",
        "E": "Craniotomy may be necessary for the management of acutely increased ICP secondary to extra-axial hematomas or trauma causing mass effect on the brain or brain stem.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Hypercalcemic crisis secondary to malignancy-associated hypercalcemia is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Acute hypercalcemia can present as a broad spectrum of symptoms and can be life threatening because of its effect on neuronal conduction, the cardiac action potential, kidney function, and volume status. It commonly presents as constipation, lethargy, weakness, and altered mental status. It can result in a short QT interval and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, leading to significant dehydration. A potential cause of severe hypercalcemic crisis is malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, which can be secondary to the humoral secretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma of the lung) or from direct invasion and lytic lesions of the bone from osseous metastases (e.g., breast cancer). Treatment emphasizes preventing end-stage kidney disease, promoting the renal excretion of calcium, reducing intestinal absorption of calcium, inhibiting bony destruction, and, if necessary, renal replacement therapy with dialysis. Treatment therefore begins with the infusion of normal saline to restore intravascular volume and dilute serum calcium, followed by the administration of osteoclast inhibitors such as bisphosphonates, and possibly calcitonin if further medications are required to decrease calcium concentrations.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Adverse reaction to cytotoxic chemotherapy can result in hypocalcemia, such as in the setting of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS most commonly occurs following chemotherapy initiation for leukemia or lymphoma. The abrupt destruction of a large number of tumor cells results in interstitial and serum release of their contents, manifesting as hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and hyperuricemia. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is not typically associated with hypercalcemia. Cerebral infarction (Choice B) would result in focal neurologic deficits that vary based on the location of the infarct. This patient presents with lethargy and somnolence without focal neurologic signs. Seizure disorders (Choice D) typically present as recurrent seizures that may be simple, partial, complex, or generalized depending on the location and extent of the epileptogenic focus. The patient presents with a multiple-day history of altered mental status without features suggestive of recurrent seizures or subclinical status epilepticus. Systemic effect of radiation therapy (Choice E) would not explain the patient's symptoms as she received radiation to the lumbar spine and iliac crest. Radiation-associated adverse effects are typically localized to the trajectory of the radiation beam. r \" , r-- r , 'I 11 . A 57-year-old woman who had tuberculosis many years ago comes to the emergency department because of hemoptysis that has progressed over the past 6 hours . She is slender but not emaciated .

A) Adenocarcinoma of the lung B) AsP,ergilloma C) Histoplasmosis D) Mesothelioma E) Small cell carcinoma of the lung Correct Answer: B. Aspergillomas are the most common presentation of pulmonary aspergillosis resulting from infection by the Aspergillus species, which is characterized by septated hyphae with acute angle branching. Pulmonary aspergillosis can result in many clinical presentations such as aspergilloma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic necrotizing aspergillosis, and airway invasive or angioinvasive aspergillosis. Aspergillomas (the formation of fungal masses) arise within existing cavitary lesions of the lung, such as those caused by previous infection with tuberculosis, emphysematous blebs or bullae, or from cavitary squamous cell lung carcinoma. Patients typically present with a persistent, sometimes bloody cough, with a history of a prior cavitary lung disease. Chest x-rays should be obtained, which will demonstrate a round, solid nodule or mass within a larger lung cavity. The location of the cavity and fungal mass varies based on the location of the cavitary disease, with an apical predominance following tuberculosis, and varied location in the setting of squamous cell carcinoma or emphysematous bullae. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E. Adenocarcinoma of the lung (Choice A) is the most common overall lung cancer, and the most common among nonsmokers. It typically presents as a chronic consolidation in the periphery of the lung. It does not form within or result in formation of a pulmonary cavity.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Bedside transabdominal ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step for the diagnosis of a potentially ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). AAl\\s most commonly occur in the infrarenal abdominal aorta secondary to a relative insufficient blood supply from the vasa vasorum. This results in an increased susceptibility to aneurysmal formation. AAl\\s are associated with atherosclerosis, increased age, male sex, family history, and tobacco use. They can present as a pulsatile abdominal mass, which may be difficult to palpate in patients with obesity. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends asymptomatic screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. Findings that raise suspicion for a ruptured AAA include acute, sharp, tearing, abdominal or back pain with features of hemorrhagic shock (tachycardia, hypotension). Bedside transabdominal ultrasonography is the quickest option to evaluate the abdominal aorta and permits delineation of the AAA size. It may show evidence of rupture or dissection as well. Definitive management includes endovascular or open surgical repair of the abdominal aorta.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast is not indicated in situations concerning for AAA rupture when hemorrhagic shock is present. Obtaining the CT scan would require an inappropriate amount of time, which would delay definitive diagnosis and management and risk further hemodynamic decompensation. HIDA scan (Choice C) evaluates the hepatobiliary tree and gallbladder and is useful to evaluate cases of suspected cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis with indeterminate ultrasonography findings. Acute cholecystitis classically presents as colicky and then continuous right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Intravenous pyelography (Choice D) involves the intravenous injection of radio-opaque contrast to visualize the renal collecting system, ureters, and bladder under fluoroscopy. This allows for the investigation of suspected urinary tract anatomic abnormalities, malignancies, and strictures. Peritoneal lavage (Choice E) involves aspiration of peritoneal contents, infusing sterile saline into the peritoneal cavity, and analyzing the effluent. If blood, food particles, bile, bilirubin, amylase, or alkaline phosphatase are found, exploratory laparotomy is indicated as the presence of these findings suggests hollow or solid viscus injury. Digital subtraction arteriography (Choice F) is a fluoroscopic technique used for visualization of blood vessels during catheter angiography. This technique is used for a variety of endovascular techniques, including arterial stenting, angioplasty, embolization, thrombectomy, and endovascular aneurysm repair. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 13 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Discontinuation of heparin is the first step in management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT typically occurs between 5 and 10 days after the initiation of heparin therapy. HIT results from the development of lgG antibodies against the complex of heparin and platelet factor 4. The antibody-heparin-platelet complex leads to the activation of platelets, which can cause thrombosis and consumption of platelets. This abnormal activation and consumption results in progressively decreasing platelet counts, which typically nadir at >50% of their initial level. Treatment requires cessation of all heparin-related products (e.g., unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin). The patient should be transitioned to a direct thrombin inhibitor or direct factor Xa inhibitor to ensure adequate anticoagulation without worsening the thrombocytopenia. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, E, and F. Measurement of antithrombin 111 concentration (Choice A) is indicated in the evaluation of hypercoagulability. Deficiency of antithrombin 111 is a cause of hypercoagulability that can be hereditary or acquired as a result of nephrotic syndrome. It would not cause acute changes in platelet count. Serum D-dimer assay (Choice B) is recommended for evaluation of patients with low pretest probability of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolus. If the D-dimer is increased, the next appropriate step would be Doppler ultrasonography evaluation of the lower extremity veins for a DVT or CT chest angiography for evaluation of a pulmonary embolism. Platelet transfusion (Choice D) is contraindicated in patients with HIT, as the causative antibody complex results in activation of platelets, which leads to further consumption and thrombosis. Thrombolysis (Choice E) is indicated for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, massive pulmonary embolism, or acute myocardial infarction without prompt access to percutaneous coronary intervention. Warfarin therapy (Choice F) would not be appropriate in the early stages of HIT as it can result in worsening of thrombosis because of transient hypercoagulability from initial decreased concentrations of proteins C and S, and can increase the risk for gangrene of the extremities and skin necrosis. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 14 of 50 'I",

The main adverse effects of diphenhydramine are a result of its central nervous system H rreceptor blockade, anticholinergic, and anti-a-adrenergic effects. These lead to a constellation of symptoms such as dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, hallucinations, delirium, ataxia, flushed skin, visual disturbances (cycloplegia), and sedation. Muscarinic type 3 receptors stimulate the contraction of smooth muscle in the urinary bladder wall. The anticholinergic adverse effects of diphenhydramine antagonize this action, resulting in impaired urinary bladder contractility, which subsequently leads to urinary retention. In addition to catheterization to prevent damage to the bladder and kidneys, treatment requires cessation of the offending agent and substitution with a second-generation H rreceptor blocking agent such as loratadine, which does not produce anticholinergic adverse effects.",

Peripheral vascular disease (Choice C) is common among older males who smoke cigarettes with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia. It typically presents as leg pain, known as claudication, that occurs during exertion and improves with rest. Claudication results from increased physiologic demand of the skeletal musculature for oxygen, which cannot be met because of the fixed obstruction to flow caused by stenotic arteries. Spinal stenosis (Choice E) presents as neurogenic claudication, characterized by leg pain when standing or walking downhill, which improves when bending forward, seated, or walking uphill. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 16 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test is necessary for the evaluation of a suspected hemolytic transfusion reaction. Transfusion reactions can range from mild (e.g., itching, fever, mild rash) to severe (e.g., hemolysis, anaphylaxis). Most reactions are mild and may not necessitate the cessation of the transfusion. An acute febrile transfusion reaction (febrile, non hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR)) occurs because of the presence of preformed antibodies to donor leukocyte antigens and occasionally from cytokines in the plasma component of the transfused sample. FNHTR ranges from mild (mild fever, minimal additional symptoms) to severe (high fevers, rigors, myalgias, nausea). Treatment consists of pausing the transfusion to rule out ABO incompatibility through performing a direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test. The Coombs test entails testing for the presence of antibodies on the recipient's red blood cells (ABO incompatibility), and if positive, would confirm an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR) instead of an FNHTR. Distinguishing the two is important as AHTR can be life threatening, leading to massive hemolysis, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Duffy antigen test assesses for the presence of the Duffy antigen on the recipient red blood cells (RBCs). The Duffy antigen is a glycoprotein that can be expressed on the surface of RBCs. Antibodies to the Duffy antigen can cause hemolytic transfusion reactions, although this is less common than ABO incompatibility. Measurement of serum bilirubin concentration (Choice C) would be appropriate for the investigation of various hyperbilirubinemia states, such as liver disease, biliary disease, or hemolysis. When assessing for an AHTR, while bilirubin may be increased, ABO incompatibility should be investigated first. Measurement of urine hemoglobin concentration (Choice D) can be used in the evaluation of causes for hemoglobinuria, such as hemolysis, glomerulonephritis, or hemolytic uremic syndrome. Determining whether an AHTR is occurring via antiglobulin (Coombs) testing takes priority over urinalysis. Measurement of urine myoglobin concentration (Choice E) is used for the evaluation of rhabdomyolysis, which results in myocyte necrosis and release of myoglobin. Myoglobin is nephrotoxic and can potentially result in acute tubular necrosis. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 17 of 50 'I"

Because of their location below the dentate line with somatic nervous system innervation, they result in significant pain during defecation and are associated with bright red blood on toilet paper. A common initiating factor for the development of an anal fissure is a history of chronic constipation resulting in the passage of hard stool, which can cause trauma to the anal mucosa. While some anal fissures self-resolve, persistent anal fissures can result in anal spasms and increased sphincter tone on examination. Initial management for persistent, symptomatic anal fissures includes administration of stool softeners, Sitz bath, topical analgesics, and topical vasodilators. The goal of this combination therapy is to relieve pain, allow for anal sphincter relaxation, and reduce traumatic passage of stool through the anal canal.",

A pilonidal cyst (Choice C) is a sac filled with fluid located near the top of the gluteal cleft and is a complication of pilonidal sinus tract disease. It occurs more frequently in patients who are male, sedentary, have increased hair density in the natal cleft, experience local trauma, or have a positive family history. Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (Choice D) is most often seen in patients with a history of human papillomavirus infection, genital warts, cigarette smoking, anal intercourse, number of sexual partners, or HIV infection. It typically presents as anal bleeding, anal and perianal pain exacerbated by defecation, foreign body sensation, and a tumor palpated on rectal examination. A thrombosed external hemorrhoid (Choice E) presents as acute, severe anal pain with an associated tender and swollen, bulging, blue-purple-colored nodule.

Normal urine output ranges between 0.5 and 2 cc/kg/hr. Prerenal azotemia refers to an acute kidney injury secondary to insufficient renal blood flow in states of hypoperfusion, which results in a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This can occur in the setting of hypovolemia and hypotension, including transient intraoperative hypotension. In response to the decreased renal blood flow, renin and angiotensin are upregulated, which stimulates increased absorption of sodium in the proximal convoluted tubule. The decreased GFR results in decreased tubular flow rate, which consequently leads to increased urea nitrogen reabsorption and reduced urine volume because of the increased resorption of solute and water. Treatment of prerenal azotemia requires treatment of the underlying cause of reduced renal blood flow, often requiring the administration of resuscitative intravenous fluids.

ATN typically occurs following an ischemic or nephrotoxic insult (e.g., anesthetics, hemoglobinuria) to the kidneys, which results in necrosis of the tubular epithelium. Granular, muddy-brown casts are usually present on urinalysis. This patient developed postsurgical oliguria following a transient episode of hypotension, likely resulting in decreased, insufficient renal blood flow. Obstruction of bladder drainage (Choice C) and ureteral obstruction (Choice E), if involving bilateral ureters, can result in postrenal azotemia from impaired urinary drainage. This typically presents as anuria because of the obstruction of urinary flow.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Administration of hydrocortisone, 100 mg intravenously, is indicated for the management of acute adrenal insufficiency. The chronic use of exogenous corticosteroids results in decreased production of adrenocorticotropic hormone from the pituitary gland. This leads to atrophy of bilateral adrenal glands, and resultant diminished native production of corticosteroids. In the event of a physiologic stressor (e.g., surgery, trauma, infection), the body's physiologic demand for corticosteroids increases but is not met because of the patient's chronic adrenal atrophy. This results in the onset of acute relative adrenal insufficiency, which presents as hypoglycemia, altered mental status, hyponatremia, tachycardia, and abnormal vasodilation, including fluid- and pressor-refractory hypotension. While difficult to diagnose because of its nonspecific presentation, acute adrenal crisis should be considered in the differential of any patient presenting with circulatory collapse. Treatment requires the administration of intravenous corticosteroids to improve systemic vascular resistance and restore hemodynamic stability.",

        "B": "ml is indicated for acute blood loss, hemorrhagic shock, and during exchange transfusion. ECG (Choice C) is indicated for the evaluation of cardiac arrhythmias and acute coronary syndromes. It does not have a defined role in the evaluation and management of acute adrenal crisis. Pulmonary angiography (Choice D) constitutes invasive catheter angiographic evaluation of the pulmonary arteries. This is no longer necessary for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism given advances in ventilation perfusion scans and CT pulmonary angiography but may still be performed if pulmonary embolectomy is required. This patient's shock is secondary to an acute adrenal crisis, not a massive pulmonary embolism. Reexploration of the abdomen (Choice E) would be indicated if there is concern for postoperative complications such as hemoperitoneum or peritonitis. This patient's shock is most likely secondary to an acute adrenal crisis from exogenous corticosteroid use, not hypovolemic or septic shock. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 21 of 50 'I 21 . A 35-year-old woman has newly diagnosed pancreatitis . Physical examination shows fibrocystic changes of the breasts . Serum studies show : Ca 2 12 mg/dl • Phosphorus 1.0 mg/dl Cholesterol 250 mg/dl Triglycerides 120 mg/dl Urinalysis shows hematuria and a urinary pH of 4.5. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a 4-mm calcification in the right upper quadrant. An x-ray of the chest is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her condition? A) Hyperlipoproteinemia B) Metastatic breast cancer C) Parathyroid adenom D) Renal tubular acidosis E) Sarcoidosis Correct Answer: C. Parathyroid adenoma is the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism commonly presents as hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, osseous pain, constipation, and potential urinary tract calculi. As well, the increased serum calcium concentration is a risk factor for acute pancreatitis. Excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) results in increased serum calcium from increased osteoclast activity, intestinal absorption, and renal tubular absorption with concomitant increased excretion of phosphorus by the renal tubules. Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a parathyroid adenoma, followed by parathyroid hyperplasia and parathyroid carcinoma. Diagnosis typically requires evaluation with a technetium 99m scan, and treatment involves resection of the parathyroid adenoma. Incorrect Answers: A, B, D, and E.",
        "A": "Hyperlipoproteinemia is an autosomal dominant disease that presents as hypertriglyceridemia contained within very-low-density lipoproteins. Hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor for acute pancreatitis, although it would not be associated with hypercalcemia. Metastatic breast cancer (Choice B) can result in hypercalcemia secondary to metastatic osteolytic lesions causing resorption of bone. Typically, phosphorus concentrations are normal or slightly increased , not low as in primary hyperparathyroidism.

      "presentation": "21. The atrial septal defect\nresults in a left-to-right shunt with abnormal flow of blood from the left atrium to the right atrium, resulting in relative volume overload of the right atrium and ventricle. This increased stroke volume of the right\nventricle results in delayed closure of the pulmonic valve, which presents as a fixed, split S and a low-grade physiologic ejection murmur on cardiac auscultation. The increased right heart volumes also result in a\n2\nprominent right ventricular impulse on physical examination, and may present an increased risk for the development of a right bundle branch block. Chest x-ray characteristically demonstrate increased caliber of the\nmain pulmonary artery and increased pulmonary vascular markings. If the atrial septal defect remains uncorrected, it can result in the development of Eisenmenger syndrome secondary to prolonged pulmonary\nvasculature remodeling, resulting in pulmonary arterial hypertension and shunt reversal leading to cyanosis.\nIncorrect Answers: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I.\nAortic stenosis (Choice A) presents as a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur, heard best at the upper right sternal border and radiating to the carotid arteries. It classically occurs secondary to age-related\nfibrotic and calcific changes of the valve, but it can occur earlier in life in cases of bicuspid aortic valve or rheumatic heart disease.\nCoarctation of the aorta (Choice C) refers to a narrowing of the thoracic aorta. It is associated with a bicuspid aortic valve and Turner syndrome. It typically presents as a systolic murmur with differential pulses and\nblood pressures between extremities.\nPatent ductus arteriosus (Choice D) results in a continuous, machine-like murmur heard best in the left second intercostal space, radiating to the clavicle.\nPulmonic stenosis (Choice E) presents as a systolic murmur, generally crescendo-decrescendo, heard best in the second left intercostal region, though quieter and with less radiation to the lower neck because of\nlower pressure in the pulmonary circulation.\nTetralogy of Fallo! (Choice F) consists of pulmonary infundibular stenosis, overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect, and right ventricular hypertrophy, resulting in a right-to-left shunt with cyanosis first noted in\ninfancy. The murmur heard with Tetralogy of Fallo! relates to the underlying ventricular septal defect characterized by a holosystolic murmur heard best in the left lower sternal border.\nTransposition of the great arteries (Choice G) results in aberrant reversal of the normal anatomical association of the aorta and pulmonary artery to the cardiac chambers secondary to failure of the aorticopulmonary\nseptum to spiral. This results in separate systemic and pulmonary circulations, with the aorta leaving the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk leaving the left ventricle. This is incompatible with life unless an\nadditional shunt allowing admixture of blood is present (e.g., patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect).\nTruncus arteriosus (Choice H) results from failure of the aorticopulmonary septum to divide the aorta and pulmonary trunk. Most patients present with a concomitant ventricular septal defect.\nVentricular septal defect (Choice I) refers to a defect in the interventricular septum, most commonly the membranous portion.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Fibrocystic disease occurs most commonly in premenopausal women over age 35 years. Patients may present with various sites of breast pain and lumps, which may be bilateral. Fibrocystic disease is characterized by the presence of cysts, stromal fibrosis, and apocrine metaplasia on histology. On examination, the cysts may appear \"blue-domed.\" This is a benign disease process of the breast and does not convey an increased risk for breast cancer; however, it can result in recurrent breast pain and discomfort. If there is significant pain or discomfort associated with the cysts, aspiration can be performed to attempt to relieve the symptoms. Cyst aspiration can yield fluid that is clear, milky, yellow, green, or brown, which are all benign, typical findings in fibrocystic disease.",

        "A": "Carcinoma encompasses many types of breast carcinoma, including invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, inflammatory breast carcinoma, and cystosarcoma phyllodes.

        "B": "Fibroadenoma is one of the most common benign breast masses in patients younger than age 35 years. It typically presents as a well-circumscribed, solid, mobile mass that demonstrates an increase in size in relation to the menstrual cycle or during pregnancy secondary to increased estrogen levels. Fibroadenomas are not typically cystic.",

A 27-year-old man undergoes Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity . He has type 2 diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and sleep apnea . Twelve hours after the operation , he is awake and alert . He is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 139 kg (305 lb); BMI is 45 kg/m 2 His temperature is 38.1° C (100 .6°F), pulse is 90/min , respirations are 10/min , and blood pressure is 145/85 mm Hg. Breath sounds are heard bilaterally with decreased air • movement. Arterial blood gas analysis on 4 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula shows : 7.31 55 mm Hg 64 mm Hg 26 mEq/L Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) AEJ.Qlication of continuous ositive airway pressure B) Switching from nasal cannula to face mask C) Bronchodilator therapy D) Naloxone therapy E) Reintubation Correct Answer: A. Application of continuous positive airway pressure is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's hypoxemia, hypoventilation, and respiratory acidosis, which are likely multifactorial on the basis of postoperative pain, sleep apnea, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. In the postoperative state, patients are at increased risk for poor ventilation and resultant atelectasis. This risk is further pronounced in patients with morbid obesity, decreased mobility, sleep apnea, and underlying lung or heart disease. The patient presents with decreased air movement on lung auscultation, bradypnea, and an arterial blood gas demonstrating hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acute respiratory acidosis. To improve this patient's ventilation and oxygenation, postoperative pain should be controlled to reduce ventilation-associated discomfort, and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), should be used to promote oxygenation through resolution of atelectasis and ventilation through maintained patency of the airway. If the patient remains hypercapnic in spite of pain control and CPAP, bi level positive airway pressure (Bi PAP) should be attempted next, which will promote increased minute ventilation by assisting inhalational effort. CPAP may stent the airways open, but if this is not sufficient to promote ventilation, escalation to BiPAP or invasive positive pressure ventilation may be required. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Switching from nasal cannula to face mask (Choice B) would allow for a higher oxygen delivery to the patient, but this may not improve the patient's ventilation as it would not promote airway stenting via continuous positive airway pressure during inhalation and exhalation. Bronchodilator therapy (Choice C) is classically used in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. While this assists in reducing airway obstruction through bronchodilation, this patient's ventilatory derangement stems from postoperative pain, sleep apnea, postoperative atelectasis, and probable obesity hypoventilation syndrome, which is more appropriately managed with positive airway pressure. Naloxone therapy (Choice D) is used for the reversal of opiate overdose or excessive sedation. This patient is awake and alert, making an opiate overdose unlikely.",
        "E": "Reintubation would be an appropriate step in management if noninvasive positive pressure ventilation does not improve the patient's respiratory acidosis, hypoxia, and hypoventilation. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should be attempted first unless the patient presents in an altered mental state or coma and is unable to protect his or her airway. r O , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 45 of 50 45 . A 92-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 6 hours after the sudden onset of abdominal pain, distention , and vomiting . She has not passed flatus during this period . She underwent appendectomy 46 years ago . Abdominal examination shows distention and diffuse tenderness . Bowel sounds are increased . An x-ray of the abdomen is shown. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings? A) Adhesions B) Appendiceal phlegmon C) Gallstone ileus D) lntussusception E) Primary tumor of the small intestine Correct Answer: A. Adhesions are the most common cause of small-bowel obstruction (SBO) in a patient with a history of prior intra-abdominal surgery. Obstruction of the small bowel occurs from partial or complete blockage of the small bowel lumen and typically presents as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and abdominal distention. Partial SBOs will allow a degree of continued flatus with diminished stooling, and complete obstruction will result in obstipation. SBO has many potential causes, although the most common are post-surgical peritoneal adhesions and hernias. On physical examination, SBO typically presents as diffuse abdominal tenderness, distention, tympany to percussion, and borborygmi (high pitched, hyperactive bowel sounds). Potential complications of SBO include bowel rupture or necrosis, which can result in abrupt peritonitic abdominal signs, such as rebound tenderness and guarding. Abdominal x-rays, if obtained in the erect position, typically demonstrate multiple air-fluid levels in the setting of dilated small bowel loops. Management requires bowel rest, intravenous hydration, and surgical intervention. If the patient has a partial obstruction, the patient should be monitored and provided supportive care. If the patient demonstrates features concerning for a persistent partial or complete obstruction, an exploratory laparotomy should be performed to alleviate the cause of the obstruction. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Appendiceal phlegmon (Choice B) is a potential complication of acute appendicitis, particularly in the setting of perforated appendicitis. It refers to an inflammatory mass-like collection consisting of the inflamed appendix, adjacent involved viscera, and peritoneum. Treatment typically requires appendectomy. Gallstone ileus (Choice C) is a cause of mechanical SBO secondary to lodging of a gallstone at the ileocecal valve. This is a potential complication of recurrent acute or chronic cholecystitis resulting in the formation of a cholecystoduodenal fistula, which can allow for the passage of gallstones into the gastrointestinal tract lumen. lntussusception (Choice D) describes telescoping of one segment of bowel into another, which can cause intestinal ischemia or obstruction. It is typically caused by a pathologic lead point (e.g., malignancy, stricture, lymphadenopathy), and presents as colicky pain and bloating. Primary tumors of the small intestine (Choice E) are rare. The most common malignant small-bowel tumors are carcinoid, lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma, and adenocarcinoma. If large enough, tumors can result in partial or complete SBO, although postsurgical adhesions are much more likely in this patient. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 46 of 50 'I 46 . A 49-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus remains hospitalized 2 days after admission for management of gangrene of the second toe of the left foot. He also has peripheral neuropathy , retinopathy , and stage Ill chronic kidney disease . His preadmission medications are insulin , valsartan , ramipril , gabapentin , and omeprazole . On admission , intravenous piperacillin -tazobactam was added to the regimen . He is following a consistent carbohydrate diet. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F) , pulse is 72/min and regular , and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Examination shows dry gangrene over the distal phalanx of the left second toe with minimal residual erythema . Pedal pulses are not palpable . Ankle systolic pressures are greater than 220 mm Hg bilaterally . Laboratory studies show : Hemoglobin A 8% c 1 Leukocyte count 8700/mm 3 with a normal differential Serum Glucose 160 mg/dL Creatinine 1.8 mg/dL On duplex ultrasonography of the left lower extremity , the femoral and popliteal arteries appear normal ; there is occlusion of all three tibial arteries in the proximal calf and reconstitution of the posterior tibial artery just proximal to the ankle . In addition to continued piperacillin-tazobactam therapy and foot care, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Below-the-knee amputation B Femorotibial bYJ)ass grafting C) High-dose clopidogrel therapy D) Percutaneous tibial angioplasty E) Supervised exercise program Correct Answer: B. Femorotibial bypass grafting is a potential treatment for severe peripheral arterial disease of the lower extremity. Peripheral arterial disease refers to the abnormally diminished flow of blood to the extremities secondary to atherosclerotic plaque. This most commonly affects the lower extremities. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, increased age, cigarette smoking, and dyslipidemia. Patients typically present with initial intermittent claudication, which results from insufficient blood flow to the muscles during exercise. As the flow of blood becomes progressively diminished with worsening atherosclerosis, it can present as pain at rest and the potential for ischemia and necrosis (gangrene) of the extremity. On examination, there are typically diminished or absent pulses in the distribution of the affected arteries. If there is critical ischemia of the extremity, gangrene may also ensue. Duplex ultrasonography or arteriography (catheter-based, CT scan, or MRI) of the lower extremities can be performed to evaluate the location and length of atherosclerotic disease and its impact on vessel luminal diameter and blood flow. Treatment includes instituting an exercise program, cilostazol, aspirin, and, if severe, angioplasty, stenting, or surgical arterial bypass. Amputation may be necessary if the degree of gangrene is significant. The patient presents with intact femoral and popliteal arteries but occluded calf arteries, although the distal posterior tibial artery demonstrates reconstitution. A femorotibial bypass graft placement would restore blood flow to the distal lower extremity. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Below-the-knee amputation (Choice A) is not indicated at this time, as the patient demonstrates gangrene of only his left second distal phalanx. Amputation is only indicated in the setting of severe gangrene of the lower extremity or if it is complicated by superinfection or necrotizing fasciitis. High-dose clopidogrel therapy (Choice C) is an antiplatelet medication that can be used in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease, although this patient is presenting with severe occlusion of his distal lower extremity, which requires surgical management at this point. Percutaneous tibial angioplasty (Choice D) is a potential intervention to improve lower extremity blood flow through catheter-based angioplasty and/or stenting. Because of the degree of occlusion in the calf blood vessels, tibial angioplasty may be impossible or impractical. Bypass grafting would provide an easier conduit for restoration of blood flow. Supervised exercise program (Choice E) is a recommended first-line therapy for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease as it stimulates the development of collateral circulation. This patient requires more urgent management involving bypass grafting. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 47 of 50 'I 47 . A 72-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of hematochezia for 12 hours . He has mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and osteoarthritis . He sustained a myocardial infarction 4 months ago . Medications include propranolol and nitroglycerin . His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4 °F), pulse is 102/min , and blood pressure is 144/82 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities . Rectal examination shows dark blood and clots . His hematocrit is 32% . The bleeding resolves spontaneously 6 hours after admission . Colonoscopy shows a short segment of sigmoid colon with edema, ulceration , and friability; no other abnormalities are noted . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Clostridium difficile colitis B) Cytomegalovirus colitis C) Diverticulitis D) lschemic colitis E) Ulcerative colitis CorrectAnswer: D. lschemic colitis refers to inadequate blood supply to the colon, which can lead to bowel wall necrosis, loss of immune barriers, and bowel perforation. lschemic colitis most commonly occurs in the setting of atherosclerosis resulting in plaque rupture within a mesenteric vessel, systemic hypotension (e.g., shock), or emboli such as in atrial fibrillation. Diminished blood flow within a vascular territory results if a specific mesenteric artery is occluded or narrowed. In the case of systemic hypotension, blood flow will be reduced within a watershed region. Patients typically present with acute abdominal pain and cramping associated with bloody bowel movements if bowel necrosis has occurred. Imaging may demonstrate thickening of the bowel wall along with pneumatosis intestinalis and possible portal venous gas or pneumoperitoneum. Diagnosis of ischemic colitis requires angiographic evaluation to assess the patency of the mesenteric arteries. Treatment of occlusive lesions includes anticoagulation, thrombectomy, angioplasty, and/or stenting. Hypoperfusion states require treatment with fluids, blood products, or vasopressors. In cases of necrosis or perforation, a bowel resection or partial colectomy may be required. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Clostridium difficile colitis (Choice A) is an opportunistic infection that commonly occurs after the use of antibiotics because of loss of native colonic microbiota. It typically presents as abdominal pain and severe watery or bloody diarrhea, and it may result in complications such as fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon. Cytomegalovirus colitis (Choice B) is an opportunistic infection commonly occurring in immunocompromised patients in the setting of solid-organ or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, severe ulcerative colitis, or AIDS. It presents as abdominal pain, fever, weight loss, and watery or bloody diarrhea.",
        "C": "Echocardiography does not have a defined role in the evaluation of a pneumothorax, as it solely evaluates the heart and pericardium. Bedside ultrasonography can be used to evaluate for the presence of a pneumothorax, although tension pneumothorax is typically a clinical diagnosis requiring emergent intervention. Radionuclide lung scan (Choice E), also known as a ventilation-perfusion scan, utilizes the administration of radionuclide compounds to evaluate the ventilation and perfusion of the lungs. This allows for the evaluation of acute pulmonary emboli when a CT scan may be contraindicated. Pulmonary angiography (Choice G) constitutes invasive catheter angiographic evaluation of the pulmonary arteries. This is no longer necessary for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism given advances in ventilation perfusion scans and CT pulmonary angiography, but it may still be performed if pulmonary embolectomy is required. Pulmonary artery catheterization (Choice H) allows for the measurement of right-sided heart, pulmonary arterial, and capillary wedge pressures, which are useful in the evaluation and management of shock (especially cardiogenic), right-sided heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 49 of 50 'I 49 . A 62-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of pain in his calves and thighs after he walks more than two blocks . The pain is relieved after he rests for 5 to 10 minutes . He has smoked one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years . His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F) , pulse is 75/min , respirations are 16/min , and blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg. Examination shows decreased femoral , popliteal , and pedal pulses bilaterally . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Aortoiliac occlusive disease (Leriche syndrome } B) Bilateral iliac aneurysms C) Bilateral superficial femoral artery occlusions D) Coarctation of the aorta E) Internal iliac artery stenosis Correct Answer: A. Aortoiliac occlusive disease (Leriche syndrome) is a type of peripheral arterial disease resulting from partial or complete occlusion of the infrarenal abdominal aorta and/or bilateral common iliac arteries. This presents as intermittent claudication of the bilateral lower extremities, with a characteristic triad of bilateral thigh and buttock claudication, absent/reduced femoral pulses, and impotence. The most common location for occlusive disease is at the aortic bifurcation, although occlusion can be multifocal and in various distributions. It is associated with large-vessel vasculitis (e.g., Takayasu arteritis), atherosclerosis, increased age, male sex, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Diagnosis occurs through a combination of physical examination findings, ankle brachia! index measurement, and CT or MR angiography. Treatment requires revascularization with angioplasty, stent placement, or vascular bypass. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Bilateral iliac artery aneurysms (Choice B) occur secondary to weakness of the arterial wall, resulting in bulging and aneurysmal dilation of the artery. They are commonly associated with atherosclerosis, with similar risk factors to abdominal aortic aneurysms. Aneurysms would not likely result in bilateral claudication symptoms unless concomitant arterial thrombosis or occlusive atherosclerotic disease was present. Bilateral superficial femoral artery occlusions (Choice C) can occur in the setting of severe atherosclerotic disease, although it would not result in loss of bilateral common femoral pulses. A central lesion resulting in occlusion of the distal aorta and bilateral iliac arteries is a more likely explanation for the patient's presentation and exam findings. Coarctation of the aorta (Choice D) is a cause of secondary hypertension related to narrowing of the thoracic aorta. It most commonly presents in childhood with differential blood pressure between upper and lower extremities, and it can result in bilateral lower extremity claudication. It is associated with bicuspid aortic valve and Turner syndrome. Internal iliac artery stenosis (Choice E) can result in claudication symptoms of the buttocks via the superior and inferior gluteal arterial branches. It would not likely result in thigh or calf claudication. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 50 of 50 'I"

It is secondary to a CD4+ T lymphocyte response against donor peptides such as major histocompatibility complexes. Resultant T lymphocyte activation leads to cytokine production and both humoral and cellular hypersensitivity reactions (type II and IV, respectively). These reactions result in vascular atherosclerosis and smooth muscle proliferation with subsequent parenchymal fibrosis and atrophy of the transplanted organ. Clinically, this manifests as chronic, progressive transplant dysfunction. In the kidneys, this is referred to as chronic graft nephropathy. Examples of chronic transplant rejection also include vanishing bile duct syndrome of the liver, bronchiolitis obliterans of the lung, and significant, rapid atherosclerosis of the heart. lmmunosuppressive medical therapy does not adequately prevent chronic rejection. It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality secondary to organ failure. It may require re-initiation of renal replacement therapy (e.g., hemodialysis), or another organ transplant.",

DVT, the presence of a blood clot within a deep vein of the upper or lower extremities, is a common complication during inpatient admissions and in the perioperative setting.

A patient with a history of malignancy, surgery, and immobility is at a substantially increased risk for the development of a DVT. Modifiable actions to reduce the incidence of DVT during admission include minimizing immobility with early postsurgical ambulation and use of a prophylactic anticoagulant, such as subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin, when deemed appropriate.",

The presence of a TEF conveys an increased risk for aspiration pneumonia and respiratory distress.

If the nasogastric tube remains coiled within the esophagus, this indicates the presence of esophageal atresia.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal artery is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis in younger and middle-aged women. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a noninflammatory and nonatherosclerotic angiopathy of medium-sized arteries (e.g., renal, carotid) that results in multifocal fibrous and muscular thickening of the arterial wall, which can lead to a bead-like appearance and resultant stenosis. Renal artery stenosis is a cause of secondary hypertension because of abnormal stimulation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus from low afferent blood flow leading to excessive production of renin and angiotensin. The reduced afferent blood flow can result in progressive renal atrophy. Secondary hypertension should be considered in new-onset or treatment-resistant hypertension, or in younger, otherwise healthy patients. There are two main causes of renal artery stenosis: fibromuscular dysplasia and atherosclerosis. In younger patients, fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause, while older patients develop renal artery stenosis more commonly from atherosclerosis. Diagnosis is established with renal artery Doppler ultrasonography or magnetic resonance angiography, which are able to quantify the degree of renal artery stenosis and renal atrophy. Treatment involves angioplasty or stenting of the stenosed renal artery to improve flow. ACE inhibitors can also be considered for unilateral stenosis but can lead to acute renal failure in the setting of significant bilateral renal artery stenosis.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Congenital renal artery disease can occur in pediatric patients, with or without an associated underlying congenital renal parenchymal disease. The patient presents in her fourth decade of life with new onset symptoms secondary to severe hypertension, making congenital renal artery disease since birth less likely. Premature atherosclerosis (Choice C) can result in the development of renal artery stenosis. While atherosclerosis is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis in older patients, if the patient has a predisposition to premature atherosclerosis, renal artery stenosis can ensue. The patient was previously healthy, and even though she presents with a significant smoking history, atherosclerotic stenosis is less likely. Undiagnosed previous renal trauma (Choice D) would be unlikely to cause renal artery stenosis. Renal trauma can result in kidney lacerations, contusions, or hematomas. While devascularization of the kidney pedicle can occur in high-energy blunt or penetrating trauma, this would result in renal atrophy, not insidious secondary renovascular hypertension. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 27 of 50 'I"

Subclavian steal syndrome occurs secondary to stenosis of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery. Movement and exertion of the affected upper extremity results in a reversal of flow from the ipsilateral vertebral artery into the subclavian artery to supply the upper extremity. This results in vertebrobasilar insufficiency, which can manifest as dizziness, vertigo, imbalance, light-headedness, and hearing disturbances. Most patients demonstrate differential blood pressures between the affected and unaffected upper extremities, with a greater than 15-mm Hg differential between the two. Physical examination may also demonstrate a subclavian bruit on auscultation and a reduction and/or delay in the ipsilateral radial pulse.",

It is performed through palpation of the radial pulse during hyperabduction of the ipsilateral shoulder beyond 90 degrees. This assesses for disturbances in the radial pulse secondary to thoracic outlet syndrome from an underlying anatomical abnormality (e.g., cervical rib, pectoralis minor syndrome). Neck auscultation (Choice D) is useful in the evaluation of a carotid bruit, which may indicate underlying carotid atherosclerosis, or to assess for radiation of a systolic ejection murmur (e.g., aortic stenosis). Percussion of the left ulnar nerve (Choice E) assesses for impingement or injury of the ulnar nerve such as in Guyon canal syndrome or cubital tunnel syndrome. Such pathology typically manifests as numbness, paresthesia, and motor weakness in the ulnar distribution. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 28 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) is one of the most common causative organisms causing monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis. Necrotizing fasciitis refers to infection spreading along a deep fascial plane, most commonly from mixed flora (anaerobic and aerobic bacteria), although it can occur secondary to a single organism. It typically presents as acute onset of pain out of proportion to examination findings, erythema, and paresthesia which progresses to anesthesia at a site of prior trauma or surgery. Risk factors include the severity of inoculation and underlying chronic systemic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, liver failure, or kidney failure. As the bacterial infection spreads along the deep fascial planes, bullae with or without crepitus may develop. The extent of infection is often difficult to assess by examination alone. Treatment requires broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and emergent debridement of the infected tissue. Often, multiple sequential debridements are required for definitive management.",

Acute, sharp abdominal pain, rigidity, rebound tenderness, and guarding are potential signs of peritonitis (\"peritoneal signs\") and raise suspicion for a perforated hollow viscus. The most common causes of a perforated hollow viscus are complicated peptic ulcer disease, appendicitis, or diverticulitis. Given the patient's location of epigastric and right upper quadrant pain, a perforated duodenal ulcer is the most likely cause. Peptic ulcer disease describes the presence of ulcers in the stomach or duodenum, which classically present with worsening abdominal pain related to the consumption (gastric) or lack of consumption (duodenal) of food. Peptic ulcer disease is strongly associated with infection with the bacterium He/icobacter pylori. Persistent inflammation related to a peptic ulcer can result in complications, including fibrosis, stricture, hemorrhage, and perforation. X-rays, preferably obtained in an erect or left lateral decubitus position, may demonstrate evidence of pneumoperitoneum. Emergent surgical laparotomy is required for repair of the underlying perforated duodenal ulcer and to lavage the peritoneum to reduce the risk for sepsis.

Acute cholangitis (Choice A) occurs secondary to acute bacterial infection of the biliary tree, typically in the setting of biliary instrumentation or choledocholithiasis. It commonly presents as fever, right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice (Charcot triad) with possible shock and altered mental status (Reynolds pentad). Acute cholecystitis (Choice B) presents as fever, abdominal pain, and tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant, often in a patient with a history of gallstones.

Acute diverticulitis (Choice C) presents because of infection or inflammation of existing colonic diverticula, which are small outpouchings of the bowel wall, most commonly located in the sigmoid colon. Diverticulitis presents as acute left lower quadrant abdominal pain, sometimes accompanied by diarrhea, fever, and tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant. Acute pancreatitis (Choice D) presents as epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis, often in a patient with a history of gallstones, alcohol use disorder, trauma, hypertriglyceridemia, or hypercalcemia. It can be complicated by necrosis, hemorrhage, abscess, or the formation of pseudocysts. Laboratory evaluation often reveals increased amylase and lipase activity. Acute pyelonephritis (Choice E) typically presents as fever, nausea, vomiting, and flank pain with associated costovertebral angle tenderness on physical examination. Pyelonephritis most commonly occurs from ascending urinary tract infections. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (Choice F) typically presents as burning epigastric and lower chest pain, often in association with consumption of a large meal or trigger food, such as an acidic beverage, coffee, chocolate, or tomatoes. It is often worse with supine positioning. Mallory-Weiss syndrome (Choice G) refers to a partial-thickness tear in the distal esophageal mucosa near the gastroesophageal junction. This occurs in the setting of severe, repetitive vomiting, and typically presents as self-resolving, small-volume hematemesis. A ruptured esophagus (Choice I) may occur from forceful vomiting (Boerhaave syndrome), trauma, invasive malignancy, or inflammation. Translocation of gastric contents into the mediastinum can cause rapidly progressive infection and sepsis from mediastinitis. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 31 of 50 31 .

A) Bile duct obstruction from migrating worms B) Hemolytic anemia C) Hepatitis C D) Resorption of an old hematoma E) Transfusion reaction Correct Answer: A. Bile duct obstruction from migrating worms is the likely cause of this patient's jaundice with evidence of Ascaris lumbricoides within the bowel. Ascaris lumbricoides, also known as a giant roundworm, is commonly transmitted through fecal-oral routes via ova within feces. After ingestion, the intestinal larvae can infiltrate the wall of the small bowel, and penetrate into blood vessels, where they may migrate to the lungs. Once in the lungs, they are coughed up and swallowed again. Final development into adult worms occurs within the small bowel, where they continue to produce eggs. Complications include bowel obstruction at the ileocecal valve and retrograde migration within the biliary tree. This can result in subsequent biliary obstruction, which leads to jaundice and direct hyperbilirubinemia. Treatment includes administration of antihelminthics (e.g., albendazole, ivermectin). Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Hemolytic anemia {Choice B) occurs secondary to a variety of intrinsic or extrinsic factors resulting in lysis of red blood cells. This typically presents as a normocytic anemia and indirect hyperbilirubinemia with associated increased lactate dehydrogenase and decreased haptoglobin. Hepatitis C {Choice C) is an RNA flavivirus that can result in chronic hepatic infection and an increased risk for cirrhosis. It can result in progressive liver dysfunction, usually characterized by a derangement in transaminases. It would be unlikely to result in a direct hyperbilirubinemia with otherwise normal liver function and no evidence of cirrhosis. Resorption of an old hematoma {Choice D) results in an increased release of hemoglobin, which is converted to bilirubin and overwhelms the bilirubin processing capacity of the liver, resulting in an indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Transfusion reaction {Choice E) may refer to a variety of different adverse reactions to transfusions, which present with varying symptoms and degrees of severity. Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction may occur in the setting of ABO incompatibility, which presents as an acute hemolytic anemia characterized by indirect hyperbilirubinemia. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 32 of 50 'I"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Hip dislocation is commonly associated with a posteriorly directed force during a motor vehicle collision (\"dashboard injury\"), where the femoral head is forcefully displaced posteriorly out of the acetabulum. Posterior hip dislocations are more common than anterior dislocations. On physical examination, they typically present as a shortened, adducted, and internally rotated lower extremity that is flexed at the hip. There is risk for injury to the sciatic nerve, and of avascular necrosis of the femoral head if there is compromise of the proximal femoral vasculature. Diagnosis is based on the presenting traumatic history, physical examination findings, and x-ray or CT scan. Treatment requires closed reduction followed by abduction bracing of the hip. Reduction should not be delayed for imaging, as a shorter time to reduction is associated with fewer complications and improved outcomes.",

Femoral neck fractures (Choice B) commonly present as a shortened and externally rotated lower extremity, not internally rotated as in a hip dislocation. Risk factors include osteoporosis. Femoral nerve contusion (Choice C) would result in dysfunction of the femoral nerve, which innervates the anterior compartment of the thigh (quadriceps muscles) and provides sensation for the anterior thigh and anteromedial leg via the saphenous branch. Gluteus medius tendon rupture (Choice D) would result in complete dysfunction of the gluteus medius, which serves to abduct and internally rotate the hip.

A consenting adult with decision-making capacity has the right to refuse some or all aspects of medical care, even if such a decision may result in short- or long-term morbidity or mortality. While the patient initially consented to the operation, he then expressed concern after an adverse reaction and demanded the procedure be canceled.

Acute cholecystitis occurs secondary to obstruction of the cystic duct from a gallstone, which results in subsequent inflammation of the gallbladder wall. It typically presents as fever, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and tenderness to palpation, often in a patient with a history of gallstones. It is occasionally preceded by symptoms of biliary colic from cholelithiasis. Characteristic ultrasonography findings of acute cholecystitis include gallbladder wall thickening and hyperemia, pericholecystic fluid, presence of gallstones, and a sonographic Murphy sign. If ultrasonography findings are equivocal, a HIDA scan can be performed; this is a nuclear medicine scan that evaluates for patency of the cystic duct and biliary tree.

Diagnostic laparoscopy (Choice G) is the gold standard for diagnosis of endometriosis, which evaluates for gun powder endometriotic implant lesions on the peritoneum. It is not typically used for the evaluation of acute gallbladder pathology. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (Choice H) evaluates the anatomy and patency of the biliary tree through endoscopic canalization of the duodenal ampulla. ERCP is indicated in the evaluation of acute and chronic biliary pathology, where it serves both a diagnostic and therapeutic purpose, including in the management of acute cholangitis, choledocholithiasis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis."

In the setting of unexplained microcytic anemia in persons over age 50 years, males, or postmenopausal female patients, CRC should be considered. If a lower GI tract source of bleeding such as CRC is suspected, a colonoscopy is indicated.

        "B": "Hemorrhoids result from dilated submucosal veins in the anal canal. They are commonly classified as either internal or external based on their relation to the pectinate line of the anal canal. Internal hemorrhoids are typically painless owing to their visceral innervation, while external hemorrhoids are painful because of somatic innervation. While hemorrhoids can result in bright red blood per rectum, bleeding is generally mild and unlikely to cause microcytic anemia. Meckel diverticulum (Choice C) is one of the most common causes of painless, bloody stools in children. A Meckel diverticulum results from persistence of the vitelline duct and can demonstrate ectopic, functional gastric or pancreatic tissue. It typically presents in childhood, most commonly before age 2 years. Peptic ulcer (Choice D) disease describes the presence of ulcers in the stomach or duodenum, which classically present with worsening abdominal pain related to the consumption (gastric) or lack of consumption (duodenal) of food. Complications include perforation, stricture formation, and upper GI bleeding, which can present with either melena or hematochezia, depending on the rate of hemorrhage. Small-bowel malignancy (Choice E) is rare. The most common malignant small bowel tumors are carcinoid, lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma, and adenocarcinoma. CRC is a significantly more common tumor of the GI tract to explain the patient's microcytic anemia and should be investigated first. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 38 of 50 'I"

The patient has a history of metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma. To provide the patient with sufficient comfort for his metastatic cancer-related pain, opioid medications are an appropriate first line analgesic medication. While the overall use of opioid medications in the general public should be limited and alternative therapies instituted in the management of chronic pain because of the risk for addiction, opioids are the most effective at providing relief in cancer-related pain. A common adverse effect of opioid medication use is constipation because of opioid-associated bowel hypomotility and increased anal sphincter tone impairing the defecation reflex. Oral cathartics (e.g., magnesium citrate) and stool softeners (e.g., docusate) should be initiated to assist the patient in defecation.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Laparoscopy is indicated for the evaluation of acute lower abdominal or pelvic pain associated with an ovarian mass. The differential diagnosis for a tender adnexal mass resulting in acute pain includes ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, tuba-ovarian abscess, appendicitis, and a ruptured ovarian cyst. Given that the mass is located within the ovary, is exquisitely tender, and the pregnancy test is negative, the potential for ovarian torsion is high. Ovarian torsion occurs secondary to hypermobility of the ovary or the presence of a large adnexal mass. Patients typically present with acute lower abdominal and pelvic pain, which may be lateralized to the side of torsion, along with nausea and vomiting. Evaluation of ovarian torsion includes visualization with ultrasonography, which can assess the size, features, underlying mass, and blood flow of the ovary. Treatment includes supportive therapy, pain management, and definitive intervention with laparoscopy to evaluate the adnexa, attempt detorsion of the ovary, and if necessary, remove a nonviable ovary or any suspicious, predisposing ovarian masses.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Carcinoma encompasses many types of breast carcinoma, including invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, inflammatory breast carcinoma, and cystosarcoma phyllodes. The most common type is invasive ductal carcinoma, which typically presents as a palpable, immobile breast mass, which may demonstrate features such as spiculated margins and microcalcifications on mammography.",
        "B": "Fibroadenoma is one of the most common benign breast masses in patients younger than age 35 years. It typically presents as a well-circumscribed, solid, mobile mass that demonstrates an increase in size in relation to the menstrual cycle or during pregnancy secondary to increased estrogen levels. Fibroadenomas are not typically cystic.",
        "C": "Echocardiography does not have a defined role in the evaluation of a pneumothorax, as it solely evaluates the heart and pericardium. Bedside ultrasonography can be used to evaluate for the presence of a pneumothorax, although tension pneumothorax is typically a clinical diagnosis requiring emergent intervention. Radionuclide lung scan (Choice E), also known as a ventilation-perfusion scan, utilizes the administration of radionuclide compounds to evaluate the ventilation and perfusion of the lungs. This allows for the evaluation of acute pulmonary emboli when a CT scan may be contraindicated. Pulmonary angiography (Choice G) constitutes invasive catheter angiographic evaluation of the pulmonary arteries. This is no longer necessary for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism given advances in ventilation perfusion scans and CT pulmonary angiography, but it may still be performed if pulmonary embolectomy is required. Pulmonary artery catheterization (Choice H) allows for the measurement of right-sided heart, pulmonary arterial, and capillary wedge pressures, which are useful in the evaluation and management of shock (especially cardiogenic), right-sided heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 49 of 50 'I 49 . A 62-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of pain in his calves and thighs after he walks more than two blocks . The pain is relieved after he rests for 5 to 10 minutes . He has smoked one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years . His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F) , pulse is 75/min , respirations are 16/min , and blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg. Examination shows decreased femoral , popliteal , and pedal pulses bilaterally . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Aortoiliac occlusive disease (Leriche syndrome } B) Bilateral iliac aneurysms C) Bilateral superficial femoral artery occlusions D) Coarctation of the aorta E) Internal iliac artery stenosis Correct Answer: A. Aortoiliac occlusive disease (Leriche syndrome) is a type of peripheral arterial disease resulting from partial or complete occlusion of the infrarenal abdominal aorta and/or bilateral common iliac arteries. This presents as intermittent claudication of the bilateral lower extremities, with a characteristic triad of bilateral thigh and buttock claudication, absent/reduced femoral pulses, and impotence. The most common location for occlusive disease is at the aortic bifurcation, although occlusion can be multifocal and in various distributions. It is associated with large-vessel vasculitis (e.g., Takayasu arteritis), atherosclerosis, increased age, male sex, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Diagnosis occurs through a combination of physical examination findings, ankle brachia! index measurement, and CT or MR angiography. Treatment requires revascularization with angioplasty, stent placement, or vascular bypass. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Bilateral iliac artery aneurysms (Choice B) occur secondary to weakness of the arterial wall, resulting in bulging and aneurysmal dilation of the artery. They are commonly associated with atherosclerosis, with similar risk factors to abdominal aortic aneurysms. Aneurysms would not likely result in bilateral claudication symptoms unless concomitant arterial thrombosis or occlusive atherosclerotic disease was present. Bilateral superficial femoral artery occlusions (Choice C) can occur in the setting of severe atherosclerotic disease, although it would not result in loss of bilateral common femoral pulses. A central lesion resulting in occlusion of the distal aorta and bilateral iliac arteries is a more likely explanation for the patient's presentation and exam findings. Coarctation of the aorta (Choice D) is a cause of secondary hypertension related to narrowing of the thoracic aorta. It most commonly presents in childhood with differential blood pressure between upper and lower extremities, and it can result in bilateral lower extremity claudication. It is associated with bicuspid aortic valve and Turner syndrome. Internal iliac artery stenosis (Choice E) can result in claudication symptoms of the buttocks via the superior and inferior gluteal arterial branches. It would not likely result in thigh or calf claudication. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 50 of 50 'I",
        "D": "Galactocele presents as a painless breast lump typically following the cessation of lactation. Aspiration would demonstrate milky fluid. Paget disease (Choice E) of the breast presents as eczema-like patches on the nipple.

A 27-year-old man undergoes Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity . He has type 2 diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and sleep apnea . Twelve hours after the operation , he is awake and alert . He is 175 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 139 kg (305 lb); BMI is 45 kg/m 2 His temperature is 38.1° C (100 .6°F), pulse is 90/min , respirations are 10/min , and blood pressure is 145/85 mm Hg. Breath sounds are heard bilaterally with decreased air • movement. Arterial blood gas analysis on 4 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula shows : 7.31 55 mm Hg 64 mm Hg 26 mEq/L Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) AEJ.Qlication of continuous ositive airway pressure B) Switching from nasal cannula to face mask C) Bronchodilator therapy D) Naloxone therapy E) Reintubation Correct Answer: A. Application of continuous positive airway pressure is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's hypoxemia, hypoventilation, and respiratory acidosis, which are likely multifactorial on the basis of postoperative pain, sleep apnea, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. In the postoperative state, patients are at increased risk for poor ventilation and resultant atelectasis. This risk is further pronounced in patients with morbid obesity, decreased mobility, sleep apnea, and underlying lung or heart disease. The patient presents with decreased air movement on lung auscultation, bradypnea, and an arterial blood gas demonstrating hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acute respiratory acidosis. To improve this patient's ventilation and oxygenation, postoperative pain should be controlled to reduce ventilation-associated discomfort, and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), should be used to promote oxygenation through resolution of atelectasis and ventilation through maintained patency of the airway. If the patient remains hypercapnic in spite of pain control and CPAP, bi level positive airway pressure (Bi PAP) should be attempted next, which will promote increased minute ventilation by assisting inhalational effort. CPAP may stent the airways open, but if this is not sufficient to promote ventilation, escalation to BiPAP or invasive positive pressure ventilation may be required. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Switching from nasal cannula to face mask (Choice B) would allow for a higher oxygen delivery to the patient, but this may not improve the patient's ventilation as it would not promote airway stenting via continuous positive airway pressure during inhalation and exhalation. Bronchodilator therapy (Choice C) is classically used in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. While this assists in reducing airway obstruction through bronchodilation, this patient's ventilatory derangement stems from postoperative pain, sleep apnea, postoperative atelectasis, and probable obesity hypoventilation syndrome, which is more appropriately managed with positive airway pressure. Naloxone therapy (Choice D) is used for the reversal of opiate overdose or excessive sedation. This patient is awake and alert, making an opiate overdose unlikely.",
        "E": "Reintubation would be an appropriate step in management if noninvasive positive pressure ventilation does not improve the patient's respiratory acidosis, hypoxia, and hypoventilation. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should be attempted first unless the patient presents in an altered mental state or coma and is unable to protect his or her airway. r O , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 45 of 50 45 . A 92-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 6 hours after the sudden onset of abdominal pain, distention , and vomiting . She has not passed flatus during this period . She underwent appendectomy 46 years ago . Abdominal examination shows distention and diffuse tenderness . Bowel sounds are increased . An x-ray of the abdomen is shown. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings? A) Adhesions B) Appendiceal phlegmon C) Gallstone ileus D) lntussusception E) Primary tumor of the small intestine Correct Answer: A. Adhesions are the most common cause of small-bowel obstruction (SBO) in a patient with a history of prior intra-abdominal surgery. Obstruction of the small bowel occurs from partial or complete blockage of the small bowel lumen and typically presents as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and abdominal distention. Partial SBOs will allow a degree of continued flatus with diminished stooling, and complete obstruction will result in obstipation. SBO has many potential causes, although the most common are post-surgical peritoneal adhesions and hernias. On physical examination, SBO typically presents as diffuse abdominal tenderness, distention, tympany to percussion, and borborygmi (high pitched, hyperactive bowel sounds). Potential complications of SBO include bowel rupture or necrosis, which can result in abrupt peritonitic abdominal signs, such as rebound tenderness and guarding. Abdominal x-rays, if obtained in the erect position, typically demonstrate multiple air-fluid levels in the setting of dilated small bowel loops. Management requires bowel rest, intravenous hydration, and surgical intervention. If the patient has a partial obstruction, the patient should be monitored and provided supportive care. If the patient demonstrates features concerning for a persistent partial or complete obstruction, an exploratory laparotomy should be performed to alleviate the cause of the obstruction. Incorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E. Appendiceal phlegmon (Choice B) is a potential complication of acute appendicitis, particularly in the setting of perforated appendicitis. It refers to an inflammatory mass-like collection consisting of the inflamed appendix, adjacent involved viscera, and peritoneum. Treatment typically requires appendectomy. Gallstone ileus (Choice C) is a cause of mechanical SBO secondary to lodging of a gallstone at the ileocecal valve. This is a potential complication of recurrent acute or chronic cholecystitis resulting in the formation of a cholecystoduodenal fistula, which can allow for the passage of gallstones into the gastrointestinal tract lumen. lntussusception (Choice D) describes telescoping of one segment of bowel into another, which can cause intestinal ischemia or obstruction. It is typically caused by a pathologic lead point (e.g., malignancy, stricture, lymphadenopathy), and presents as colicky pain and bloating. Primary tumors of the small intestine (Choice E) are rare. The most common malignant small-bowel tumors are carcinoid, lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma, and adenocarcinoma. If large enough, tumors can result in partial or complete SBO, although postsurgical adhesions are much more likely in this patient. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 46 of 50 'I 46 . A 49-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus remains hospitalized 2 days after admission for management of gangrene of the second toe of the left foot. He also has peripheral neuropathy , retinopathy , and stage Ill chronic kidney disease . His preadmission medications are insulin , valsartan , ramipril , gabapentin , and omeprazole . On admission , intravenous piperacillin -tazobactam was added to the regimen . He is following a consistent carbohydrate diet. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F) , pulse is 72/min and regular , and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Examination shows dry gangrene over the distal phalanx of the left second toe with minimal residual erythema . Pedal pulses are not palpable . Ankle systolic pressures are greater than 220 mm Hg bilaterally . Laboratory studies show : Hemoglobin A 8% c 1 Leukocyte count 8700/mm 3 with a normal differential Serum Glucose 160 mg/dL Creatinine 1.8 mg/dL On duplex ultrasonography of the left lower extremity , the femoral and popliteal arteries appear normal ; there is occlusion of all three tibial arteries in the proximal calf and reconstitution of the posterior tibial artery just proximal to the ankle . In addition to continued piperacillin-tazobactam therapy and foot care, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Below-the-knee amputation B Femorotibial bYJ)ass grafting C) High-dose clopidogrel therapy D) Percutaneous tibial angioplasty E) Supervised exercise program Correct Answer: B. Femorotibial bypass grafting is a potential treatment for severe peripheral arterial disease of the lower extremity. Peripheral arterial disease refers to the abnormally diminished flow of blood to the extremities secondary to atherosclerotic plaque. This most commonly affects the lower extremities. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, increased age, cigarette smoking, and dyslipidemia. Patients typically present with initial intermittent claudication, which results from insufficient blood flow to the muscles during exercise. As the flow of blood becomes progressively diminished with worsening atherosclerosis, it can present as pain at rest and the potential for ischemia and necrosis (gangrene) of the extremity. On examination, there are typically diminished or absent pulses in the distribution of the affected arteries. If there is critical ischemia of the extremity, gangrene may also ensue. Duplex ultrasonography or arteriography (catheter-based, CT scan, or MRI) of the lower extremities can be performed to evaluate the location and length of atherosclerotic disease and its impact on vessel luminal diameter and blood flow. Treatment includes instituting an exercise program, cilostazol, aspirin, and, if severe, angioplasty, stenting, or surgical arterial bypass. Amputation may be necessary if the degree of gangrene is significant. The patient presents with intact femoral and popliteal arteries but occluded calf arteries, although the distal posterior tibial artery demonstrates reconstitution. A femorotibial bypass graft placement would restore blood flow to the distal lower extremity. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Below-the-knee amputation (Choice A) is not indicated at this time, as the patient demonstrates gangrene of only his left second distal phalanx. Amputation is only indicated in the setting of severe gangrene of the lower extremity or if it is complicated by superinfection or necrotizing fasciitis. High-dose clopidogrel therapy (Choice C) is an antiplatelet medication that can be used in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease, although this patient is presenting with severe occlusion of his distal lower extremity, which requires surgical management at this point. Percutaneous tibial angioplasty (Choice D) is a potential intervention to improve lower extremity blood flow through catheter-based angioplasty and/or stenting. Because of the degree of occlusion in the calf blood vessels, tibial angioplasty may be impossible or impractical. Bypass grafting would provide an easier conduit for restoration of blood flow. Supervised exercise program (Choice E) is a recommended first-line therapy for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease as it stimulates the development of collateral circulation. This patient requires more urgent management involving bypass grafting. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 47 of 50 'I 47 . A 72-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of hematochezia for 12 hours . He has mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and osteoarthritis . He sustained a myocardial infarction 4 months ago . Medications include propranolol and nitroglycerin . His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4 °F), pulse is 102/min , and blood pressure is 144/82 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities . Rectal examination shows dark blood and clots . His hematocrit is 32% . The bleeding resolves spontaneously 6 hours after admission . Colonoscopy shows a short segment of sigmoid colon with edema, ulceration , and friability; no other abnormalities are noted . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Clostridium difficile colitis B) Cytomegalovirus colitis C) Diverticulitis D) lschemic colitis E) Ulcerative colitis CorrectAnswer: D. lschemic colitis refers to inadequate blood supply to the colon, which can lead to bowel wall necrosis, loss of immune barriers, and bowel perforation. lschemic colitis most commonly occurs in the setting of atherosclerosis resulting in plaque rupture within a mesenteric vessel, systemic hypotension (e.g., shock), or emboli such as in atrial fibrillation. Diminished blood flow within a vascular territory results if a specific mesenteric artery is occluded or narrowed. In the case of systemic hypotension, blood flow will be reduced within a watershed region. Patients typically present with acute abdominal pain and cramping associated with bloody bowel movements if bowel necrosis has occurred. Imaging may demonstrate thickening of the bowel wall along with pneumatosis intestinalis and possible portal venous gas or pneumoperitoneum. Diagnosis of ischemic colitis requires angiographic evaluation to assess the patency of the mesenteric arteries. Treatment of occlusive lesions includes anticoagulation, thrombectomy, angioplasty, and/or stenting. Hypoperfusion states require treatment with fluids, blood products, or vasopressors. In cases of necrosis or perforation, a bowel resection or partial colectomy may be required. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, and E. Clostridium difficile colitis (Choice A) is an opportunistic infection that commonly occurs after the use of antibiotics because of loss of native colonic microbiota. It typically presents as abdominal pain and severe watery or bloody diarrhea, and it may result in complications such as fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon. Cytomegalovirus colitis (Choice B) is an opportunistic infection commonly occurring in immunocompromised patients in the setting of solid-organ or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, severe ulcerative colitis, or AIDS. It presents as abdominal pain, fever, weight loss, and watery or bloody diarrhea."

        "A": "Observation only is not appropriate as the patient presents with findings concerning for an inhalation injury, which presents an increased risk for acute airway obstruction. This requires endotracheal intubation to protect the airway. Inhaled corticosteroid and epinephrine therapy (Choice B) is appropriate for the treatment of diseases causing airway edema and stridor such as croup. In inhalation injury, the airway should first be mechanically protected through endotracheal intubation. Intravenous corticosteroid therapy and intermittent positive pressure breathing (Choice C) is appropriate therapy for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation would not adequately protect the patient's airway from obstruction.",
