These\ninclude biologic plausibility, dose-response relationship, specificity and strength of association, and temporal relationship between exposure to one variable and\ndevelopment of the second variable. In this example, the two variables being studied are cardiovascular disease and cigarette smoking. The positive correlation found\nbetween increased risk for cardiovascular disease and number of cigarettes smoked daily indicates that as the number of cigarettes smoked daily increased, so does the\nrisk for cardiovascular disease. This is an example of a dose-response relationship. The number of cigarettes smoked daily is considered the dose, and risk for\ncardiovascular disease is considered the response. The positive correlation between the two is more suggestive of causation than if the risk for cardiovascular disease\nwere the same no matter what number of cigarettes were smoked daily. Thus, the presence of a dose-response relationship in this study is one criterion for causality.",

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is\ndefined as a positive PPD skin test or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) in the absence of active pulmonary or disseminated infection with Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis (MTB). Risk factors for exposure to MTB include residence in a region of the world where it is endemic, employment as a healthcare worker, or residence in\nprisons or homeless shelters. The PPD skin test is considered positive at varying sizes of induration based on the population in which the test is done. While patients with\nHIV and other conditions that cause immunosuppression are considered to have a positive PPD skin test if the induration is measured at or above 5 mm, the general\npopulation is considered to have a positive test if the induration is 15 mm or greater. Health care workers or those who work with high-risk populations are often considered\nto have positive results warranting treatment at 10 mm of induration. While the bCG can cause a false-positive PPD reaction, the effect usually wanes within 5 years of\nvaccination, so this patient's induration should not be attributed to prior vaccination status.

The most effective initial treatment includes psychotherapy and/or antidepressant medication. No particular class of antidepressant medication is more\neffective than the other, though different classes have different adverse effect profiles. As such, patient preferences about adverse effect profiles commonly influence\nmedication choice. Serotonergic medications (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs) commonly impair sexual function within all three phases of sexual\nresponse (libido, sexual arousal, and orgasm). Mirtazapine, an atypical antidepressant medication, is a selective a.-receptor antagonist and serotonin modulator that both\nincreases serotonin release and antagonizes serotonin receptors. Because of its serotonin receptor antagonism, mirtazapine carries a decreased risk for sexual\ndysfunction compared to antidepressant medications that purely inhibit serotonin reuptake.

Severe inhalant toxicity can manifest with tachydysrhythmias and respiratory depression, and\nultimately seizures or coma. Treatment is primarily supportive, though some inhalants have specific antidotes (eg, methylene blue for nitrites). Prevention is key; schools\nshould monitor use of solvent-based products, and parents and children should be educated about the risks of inhalants.",

Aldosterone is produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex and plays an important role in the maintenance of blood volume and sodium\nhomeostasis, primarily through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway. Renin is produced by the juxtaglomerular cells as a response to decreased blood flow to the\nrenal system, decreased sodium delivery to the macula densa, or increased sympathetic tone. Renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin |, which is then converted to\nangiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II subsequently signals the adrenal gland to secrete aldosterone. Aldosterone promotes the\nreabsorption of sodium ions in exchange for potassium and hydrogen ion secretion in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts, causing the indirect reabsorption of\nwater, which results in the development of hypertension. Increased concentrations of aldosterone provide negative feedback to renin, decreasing its production. Primary\nhyperaldosteronism presents with hypertension, metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and an increased aldosterone-to-renin ratio caused by the independent secretion of\naldosterone, most commonly from an adrenal adenoma, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, or familial hyperaldosteronism.",

Tachycardia, mild hypotension, and signs of dehydration (eg, dry mucous membranes) would be expected on vital signs and physical examination.\nLaboratory studies show ketones in the blood and urine, as well as hypoosmolar hyponatremia, and hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis caused by\ndehydration and volume contraction. Ketosis can contribute to a secondary metabolic acidosis as well. Since HG is associated with molar pregnancy, it is important to\nexclude this condition with pelvic ultrasonography and to assess the quantitative concentration of B-human chorionic gonadotropin. Treatment of HG includes the\nintravenous administration of fluids, vitamin B, supplementation, antiemetics, and in severe cases, total parenteral nutrition.

This results in\ninflammatory infiltration of the proximal small bowel, which leads to characteristic intraepithelial lymphocytosis, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. Malabsorption of\nsubstances in the proximal small bowel ensues, which presents symptomatically as chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, and nutritional deficiencies. Malabsorption often results\nin the impaired absorption of vitamin D, leading to hypocalcemia and secondary osteomalacia. Patients may also develop a secondary hyperparathyroidism and\nhypophosphatemia in an attempt to compensate for poor gastrointestinal calcium absorption. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning can be useful for\nassessing bone density in patients with celiac disease who are at risk for osteomalacia.

This patient, who suffered blunt trauma to the chest and now has\nchest pain, mildly increased troponin concentration, and ECG showing T-wave inversions most likely has a myocardial contusion. Myocardial contusion may occur as the\nresult of any blunt trauma to the chest but is more common after deceleration injuries. Because of the location of the right atrium and ventricle closer to the surface of the\nchest, the right side of the heart is more frequently injured than the left. While catastrophic injury to the valves, the interventricular septum, or the ventricular free wall can\nresult in rapid decompensation and death, mild myocardial contusion may present with more subtle findings, including new ECG changes. ECG changes are highly\ndiverse, and patients may develop anything from new bundle branch blocks to cardiac conduction delays, supraventricular tachycardia, or nonspecific ST-segment\nchanges.

Atrial fibrillation typically presents with palpitations, fatigue, lightheadedness, and dyspnea if\nsymptomatic. Atrial fibrillation can result from a variety of factors, including dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, alcohol or illicit drug use, and structural heart disease.\nFor example, mitral stenosis, if severe enough, can result in left atrial enlargement, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and flutter.\nHyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis are also associated with the development of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation can be complicated by a rapid ventricular response (pulse\n>100/min), which can result in reduced stroke volume and decreased cardiac output leading to symptomatic heart failure, and potentially hypotension and hemodynamic\ninstability in severe cases. In these cases, rate- or rhythm-controlling agents and/or synchronized cardioversion may be necessary. However, in this patient who is\nhemodynamically stable with a normal ventricular rate, no further interventions are necessary other than intravenous fluid resuscitation for the patient's dehydration, which\nwill likely improve his symptoms.

Frequently, this type of infection also causes acute renal failure. Shiga-toxin causes diffuse endothelial dysfunction with a tendency toward microvascular\nthrombosis.

When erythrocytes come into contact with microvascular clots, they are damaged, forming schistocytes, which are apparent on the peripheral blood smear\nas fragmented cells. They also release lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leading to an increased concentration of serum LDH, while haptoglobin is depleted by binding to free\nhemoglobin. Thrombosis also occurs in the renal vasculature because of underlying endothelial damage, resulting in renal injury. Treatment of STEC is supportive.\nAntibiotics are typically avoided as they can result in increased release of shiga-toxin and clinical deterioration, although in some instances the use of macrolide antibiotics\nhas been shown to be beneficial.

Thalassemia can occur in a variety of forms, and manifestations depend on the number of\nallele deletions or mutations, and whether these mutations affect the a-globin or B-globin alleles. The fact that this patient has decreased concentrations of hemoglobin A\n(a-B,) and increased concentrations of hemoglobin F (a-y,) suggests a deficiency in production of B-globin chains, which is consistent with B-thalassemia. Given that\nthere are only two B-globin alleles, deletion or mutation of one of these genes (or regulatory elements) can lead to a profound reduction in B-globin, causing microcytic\nanemia (B-thalassemia intermedia). Mutations in both alleles, on the other hand, results in near absence of B-globin and leads to profound, transfusion-dependent anemia\nin addition to physical features that suggest extramedullary hematopoiesis, such as frontal bossing (thalassemia major). B-thalassemia minor (trait) is the inheritance of\none deleted or mutated allele, but the remaining normal allele is sufficient to produce the beta chain, and patients are generally asymptomatic. Treatment for thalassemia\nintermedia is supportive, and most patients do not routinely require blood transfusions.",

Measles (rubeola) virus is a highly contagious paramyxovirus that causes the disease\nmeasles, which is associated with acute febrile illness and potentially severe sequelae. It is more common in children than adults. It characteristically presents with\nprodromal fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and a confluent maculopapular rash that starts at the head and neck and spreads to the trunk, excluding the palms and\nsoles. Physical examination may show bright red macules with a bluish-white center on the buccal mucosa and lymphadenopathy. Measles is prevented by immunization\nwith the live MMR vaccine. Live attenuated vaccines are made of viable viral pathogens whose virulence has been reduced but occasionally replication of the strain\ncontained in the vaccine can cause symptoms such as fever, transient rash, or transient joint pain. Other live attenuated vaccines include the yellow fever, intranasal\ninfluenza, smallpox, varicella-zoster, rotavirus, and the oral poliovirus vaccines. The patient lacks other clinical manifestations of true measles infection including prodromal\nfever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and Koplik spots, so his presentation is most likely caused by replication of the measles strain contained in the live vaccine.",

Alternatively, patients with the disease may search their memory for any potential exposure that\ncould be related to their disease compared to controls, who may search their memory less thoroughly.

This results\nin increased free water absorption and is typically utilized to maintain tight regulation of serum osmolality. Inadequate production of ADH by the posterior pituitary gland\nmay occur in the setting of various pathologies, such as pituitary tumors, trauma, tuberculosis, or intracranial surgery. This results in a decreased concentration of\naquaporin channels inserted within the principal cells of the collecting tubule, leading to an inability to absorb adequate amounts of free water, which results in dilute urine\nand increased serum osmolality.

The three most common causative organisms are Neisseria gonorrhoeae,\nChlamydia trachomatis, and Herpes simplex virus. Gonococcal conjunctivitis presents within 3 to 5 days after birth and is characterized by purulent discharge. Gonococcal\ninfections are aggressive and can rapidly progress to keratitis, corneal perforation, or endophthalmitis. Chlamydial conjunctivitis presents within 5 to 14 days of birth and is\ncharacterized by watery discharge. Herpetic conjunctivitis presents greater than 14 days after birth. All neonates should be given topical antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent\ngonococcal conjunctivitis. Historically, topical silver nitrate was a common prophylactic agent that was also a frequent cause of chemical conjunctivitis, which presents\nwithin the first 3 days after birth. The use of silver nitrate has more recently been supplanted by the use of topical erythromycin, which binds to bacterial ribosomal 50S\nsubunits to prevent protein synthesis.",

Melanoma is a neoplasm of melanocytes, which contain pigment in melanosomes. Malignant melanoma has the ability to rapidly invade and metastasize, which\ncarries a poor prognosis when diagnosed late. Subtypes include superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna, and acral lentiginous. Like other forms of malignant\nmelanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma is marked by a pigmented lesion that demonstrates asymmetry, irregular appearing borders, variable coloration, a diameter greater\nthan 6 mm, and rapid evolution in characteristics. Acral lentiginous melanoma which involves the nail may begin as a longitudinal brown streak on the nail. However, this\nfinding, termed longitudinal melanonychia, can also be normal in certain ethnic groups. If longitudinal melanonychia is increasing in thickness or pigment has extended\nonto the nail fold (Hutchinson sign), then melanoma is increasingly likely.

Sensitivity is the ability of a test to detect a\ndisease if it is present. Sensitivity may be calculated as 1 — false negative rate. A test is described as sensitive if it has a high likelihood of disease detection, and therefore\na low likelihood of a false negative (type 2 error). High sensitivity is therefore useful in ruling out a disease. Along with sensitivity, specificity is also used to measure the\nquality of a diagnostic test. A test is described as specific if it has a high likelihood that when disease is absent, the test is negative; it therefore has a low likelihood of a\nfalse positive (type 1 error). Specificity may be calculated as 1 — false positive rate. High specificity is useful when considering a disease. In this case, assuming that the\npatient's infiltrating ductal carcinoma was present at the time of her mammography 6 months earlier, the patient had a false negative mammography result: her test result\nwas negative when she actually had disease. Because sensitivity is calculated as 1 — false negative rate, the false negative rate (the value desired by this patient) can be\neasily determined by subtracting the sensitivity from 100%.

The first step in identifying the cause of hyponatremia is\ncalculating the serum osmolality. Serum osmolality = (2*Na) + (BUN/2.8) + (glucose/18). When serum osmolality is >295, as in this case (serum Osm = 300), then\nhypertonic hyponatremia is present. This is caused by excessive solute in the plasma such as glucose, mannitol, or contrast agents. These agents cause movement of\nwater from intracellular to extracellular spaces, causing dilution of sodium in the process. In this case, the patient has an extremely elevated glucose which is also causing\nhyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic (HHNK) state. HHNK, also known as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), is a condition of severe hyperglycemia and\nincreased serum osmolality resulting in profound dehydration, without the abnormal production of ketones. This typically occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus\nafter an inciting stress event, such as an acute infection. The increased osmolality results in excessive osmotic diuresis in the kidneys, which leads to progressive, marked\ndehydration. Presenting symptoms include lethargy, thirst, polyuria, altered mental status, and potential coma and death if untreated. Laboratory studies typically show\nhyperglycemia (>500 mg/dL), and increased osmolality without acidosis because of the lack of ketone production. Treatment requires aggressive fluid resuscitation with\nisotonic intravenous fluids and insulin.",

Postauricular and suboccipital lymphadenopathy may also be present. However, when a pregnant patient is infected with rubella, the\noutcomes for the fetus may be much more serious. Fetal rubella infection causes sensorineural deafness, neurodevelopmental delay, congenital cardiac defects,\nmicrocephaly, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Because the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine that provides protection against rubella is a live-attenuated virus, it\nshould not be administered during pregnancy. Thus, it is pertinent to ensure that women of reproductive age are immune to rubella. Because of this patient's nonimmune\nrubella titer results, she should receive the rubella vaccine as soon as possible.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) refers to an abnormally rapid pulse and rhythm originating from above the ventricles, typically with a regular rhythm, absence of P.\nwaves, and a narrow QRS complex on ECG. Patients with SVT can have acute symptoms of lightheadedness, palpitations, diaphoresis, and syncope. In infants, signs and\nsymptoms can include pallor, irritability, poor feeding, and cyanosis. Infants who present with SVT typically have a pulse between 220 and 280/min. SVT may be caused by\nstructural defects in the His-Purkinje system (eg, in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), may be idiopathic, may be caused by inherent conduction differences in fast and\nslow AV nodal pathways, or may be provoked by alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, or psychological stress. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable, cardioversion is\nindicated in the management of SVT. For patients who are hemodynamically stable, attempts can be made to terminate the tachyarrhythmia by vagal maneuvers (eg, ice\nor cold water over the face) or with adenosine.",
