It is associated with developmental delay. Laboratory evaluation will show leukopenia and decreased calcium concentrations, while a chest x-ray may demonstrate the absence of a thymic shadow, as in this patient. Further evaluation typically includes an echocardiography and kidney ultrasonography. Treatment is supportive. This patient presenting with jitteriness in the setting of hypocalcemia and truncus arteriosus likely has DiGeorge syndrome, making hypoparathyroidism the most likely diagnosis.

While many causes of hypothyroidism exist, Hashimoto disease is a common cause of painless thyroiditis, which may present with a palpable, enlarged thyroid gland, as in this patient. With progressive inflammation and destruction of the thyroid parenchyma, circulating concentrations of thyroxine and triiodothyronine decrease, with resulting feedback on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary leading to increased concentrations of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and prolactin. The increased TSH concentration is measurable in serum and provides ongoing trophic stimulation to the thyroid gland. Increased prolactin may cause breast development, galactorrhea, and may promote irregular anovulatory cycles or amenorrhea through feedback on gonadotropin-releasing hormone.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) presents with a heart murmur described as a continuous \"machinery-like\" murmur best heard in the left second intercostal and left infraclavicular regions. Since blood flow through the PDA occurs in both systole and diastole, the sound will be present throughout the cardiac cycle. The ductus arteriosus is one of several physiologic shunts existing during the prenatal period. In utero, oxygenated blood is obtained from the placenta, not from the lungs, and the ductus arteriosus (DA) allows the shunting of oxygenated blood from the pulmonary artery directly to the aorta while bypassing the fetal lungs, which are filled with amniotic fluid. At birth, closure of the DA occurs by the release of prostaglandins and increased arterial oxygen tension. With increased blood oxygenation and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance following birth or with indomethacin use, prostaglandin production falls and the ductus closes. Certain congenital heart diseases require the presence of a shunt to allow arteriovenous admixture of oxygenated blood, for example, transposition of the great vessels. In the absence of such a requirement for shunting, a PDA results in a chronic extracardiac left-to-right shunt that may result in pulmonary hypertension or right-sided heart failure, with the risk for Eisenmenger syndrome if uncorrected. PDAs that are small often go undetected until adulthood because the left-to-right shunt is not significant enough to cause symptoms.",

Headaches that are secondary to increased intracranial pressure often are worse when lying down and relieved by standing. The most common risk factors for the development of pseudotumor cerebri include female sex and obesity. However, hypervitaminosis A from increased dietary intake is another potential cause of IIH.

Iron is required for the synthesis of heme, which is a necessary component of the hemoglobin molecule, and thus, of erythrocytes. It functions to shuttle oxygen to and from peripheral tissues. Erythrocytes on the peripheral blood smear are hypochromic as a result of deficient hemoglobin concentration. It is hypothesized  that erythrocytes are microcytic as a result of continuing erythrocyte division in order to reach an adequate hemoglobin concentration.

Tufted hemangiomas present as firm, red lesions with ill-defined borders on the arms, legs, and trunk, often sparing the head and face. They become larger, darker, and indurated with age, although most stabilize in childhood. Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma is a subcutaneous vascular mass that appears as a purpuric raised lesion, most commonly on the extremities. It also tends to become darker and indurated with time. Both of these vascular tumors are associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, which presents with bleeding, ecchymoses, and petechiae as a result of platelet sequestration by the tumor and an associated coagulopathy. Development of this syndrome typically presents with a rapid enlargement of the tumor, thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and increased concentration.

Initial evaluation requires an attempt at insertion of a nasogastric tube and evaluation of its position with a chest x-ray. If the nasogastric tube remains coiled within the esophagus, this suggests the presence of esophageal atresia.

The aspiration of acidic stomach contents may cause aspiration pneumonitis, whereas the aspiration of gastrointestinal flora and bacteria can cause aspiration pneumonia. The volume of aspirate is a strong predictor of complications from aspiration, especially in the case of pneumonia, as the bacterial inoculum may overwhelm the native ability of pulmonary alveolar defense (macrophages, cilia, mucus) to prevent colonization, replication, and infection. Aspiration pneumonia classically presents with a cough productive of foul-smelling sputum, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, and rhonchi on physical examination. Imaging classically shows an infiltrate in the most dependent lung segments at the time of aspiration (eg, in the superior segment of the inferior lobe when supine or lower lobes when erect). Patients at a higher risk for aspiration include those with impaired airway-protective reflexes (eg, neurological injury, myasthenia gravis, altered mental status), frequent or forceful emesis, abnormal pharyngeal or airway anatomy or function (eg, malignancy, tracheoesophageal fistula), or severe gastroesophageal reflux. Options for the management of severe gastroesophageal reflux in children include dietary changes and proton pump inhibitors or histamine- 2 receptor antagonists, although these would not assist in decreasing the risk for aspiration pneumonia. Fundoplication is a surgical procedure that improves the gastroesophageal sphincter tone by wrapping the fundus around the distal esophagus, which decreases the frequency and severity of reflux.",

Patients may also present with an associated paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome. Physical examination may show a firm, nodular mass that crosses the midline and diastolic hypertension. Diagnosis is suggested by the presence of increased catecholamine metabolites in the serum and urine. Neuroblastoma is associated with overamplification of the MYCN oncogene. Histologic characteristics include small round blue cells that may form rosette patterns clustered around a central lumen, with positive stains for bombesin and neuron-specific enolase markers.

His physical examination findings of jugular venous distention and edema of the face and upper extremities are suggestive of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, which is caused by obstruction of the SVC and venous congestion of the upper body and face. Obstruction of the SVC is often caused by extrinsic compression by a malignant mediastinal or pulmonary mass, which may be secondary to lung cancer, lymphoma, or metastatic disease from another primary source. Pleural effusions are clinically suspected on examination in the setting of dullness to percussion and diminished breath sounds, and can be visualized on imaging including chest x-ray, CT scan, or ultrasonography. Analyzing the pleural fluid can show an underlying cause to guide therapy. Fluid is inspected for cell counts, organisms, pH, enzyme activity, and serum glucose concentration and total protein concentrations. Low pH and low serum glucose are indicative of increased cellular metabolism in the fluid and may indicate underlying malignancy and/or infection. Malignant pleural effusions may have increased erythrocyte counts or appear grossly hemorrhagic as a result of tumor invasion and disruption of blood vessels and the visceral pleura. As well, Light criteria assesses whether the pleural effusion is likely to be exudative (eg, complex fluid resulting from pneumonia, empyema, malignancy, or inflammatory disease) or transudative (eg, serous fluid resulting from imbalanced hydrostatic or oncotic pressures) through evaluating the concentrations of pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase.",

Transient synovitis is an inflammatory condition involving the synovial lining of weight-bearing joints, with the hip being commonly affected. It classically presents in children recovering from a viral infection with pain on weight-bearing, antalgic gait, refusal to ambulate, tenderness over the joint, and pain elicited with range of motion. Vital signs are generally within normal limits, as are laboratory studies with the exception of increased markers of inflammation such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Antecedent viral infection has been reported in up to 30% of cases of transient synovitis. Diagnosis involves the exclusion of emergent or urgent conditions such as cellulitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and fracture. Treatment is supportive, and involves rest plus nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, making oral ibuprofen the best choice for this patient. If there is diagnostic uncertainty, arthrocentesis to exclude septic arthritis, along with imaging to assess for osteomyelitis or fracture should be conducted.",

Vancomycin inhibits the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, and therefore has the greatest activity against gram-positive organisms.

Classically, it presents in an infant or young child with recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain often punctuated by asymptomatic periods. lntussusception typically occurs as a result of the presence of a pathologic lead point, often lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphadenopathy, Meckel diverticulum, stricture, or malignancy, which acts to draw one segment of bowel into an adjacent segment during peristalsis. If the intussusception self-resolves, there may be no symptoms. If it does not resolve, traction on mesenteric vessels can result in hypoperfusion of the segment with resultant inflammation, hemorrhage, obstruction, and pain. It may be detected on physical examination as an elongated mass, often in the right upper quadrant. Diagnosis consists of clinical history and physical examination and is supported by imaging. Ultrasonography evaluation is preferred in young children and will show telescoping interposed bowel segments in longitudinal orientation or a targetoid appearance in transverse orientation. Treatment of an ileocolic intussusception requires the administration of a contrast enema, which decreases the intussusception. Contrast enema is both diagnostic and therapeutic in this setting. Surgery may be required in cases where there is repetitive failure of the enema to decrease the intussusception or if the patient presents with symptoms concerning for bowel necrosis or perforation.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Puberty in boys typically follows a predictable course of gonadarche (enlargement of the testes), followed by pubarche (pubic hair), followed by adrenarche (axillary hair, facial hair, voice changes), followed by a growth spurt. This differs from the process in girls, which proceeds from thelarche (breast buds) to pubarche to growth spurt and finally menarche. In boys, delayed puberty is defined as the absence of testicular enlargement or secondary sexual characteristics at the age of 14 years. The most common cause of delayed puberty is constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), accounting for approximately 50% of cases, a normal variant. In CDGP, there is a transient defect in the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone with resultant delay in the stimulation of pituitary production of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. CDGP tends to be familial with many members of the same family undergoing late puberty compared with peers. In this case, the patient has undergone gonadarche (indicated by his Tanner stage 2 genital development) and pubarche but has not yet undergone adrenarche. Thus, while delayed, the sequence of his procession through the steps of puberty is appropriate and he can be reassured that his development will continue to progress.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Neonatal jaundice is defined as an increased bilirubin concentration (greater than 5 mg/dl), which results from either increased hemolysis {bilirubin generation) or decreased bilirubin conjugation or excretion. Hyperbilirubinemia can be divided into direct and indirect forms in which either conjugated or unconjugated bilirubin accumulate, respectively. It can also be divided into physiologic and pathologic forms. Features of physiologic jaundice include development after 24 hours of life, a rate of bilirubin rise of less than 0.5 mg/dl daily, a maximum peak of 14 to 15 mg/dl, and a predominance of indirect bilirubin (greater than 90%). In contrast, jaundice within the first 24 hours of life {which rises faster than 0.5 mg/dl per hour), a predominance of direct bilirubin, and persistence beyond 2 weeks would suggest a pathologic cause. Newborn physiologic jaundice, also termed benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, occurs in nearly all newborns and is caused by the increased breakdown of red blood cells and thus generation of bilirubin, the immature liver metabolism of bilirubin, and the increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. These features taken together cause an indirect hyperbilirubinemia to develop. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is closely monitored in order to prevent kernicterus, which refers to the deposition of bilirubin in the basal ganglia, pons, and cerebellum. This can occur at bilirubin concentrations of 25 to 30 mg/dl. Treatment of the underlying cause of the jaundice and phototherapy for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia or exchange transfusion prevents this potentially fatal consequence. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. ABO isoimmunization {Choice A) occurs when maternal lgG antibodies to fetal red blood cell antigens cause either fetal or neonatal destruction of these red blood cells. Bilirubin production is increased, and an indirect hyperbilirubinemia ensues. This cause of neonatal jaundice will present with pathologic findings such as an early presentation and rapid rate of rise, neither of which are present in this case. Biliary obstruction {Choice B) caused by biliary atresia is a common cause of direct hyperbilirubinemia. In congenital biliary atresia, the common bile duct is occluded or atretic and bile is unable to pass into the duodenum. Dehydration {Choice C) is the mechanism behind breastfeeding jaundice. In the first week of life, as a breastfeeding mother's milk begins to establish, the infant may become dehydrated. Dehydration leads to increased enterohepatic circulation and reabsorption of bilirubin, resulting in indirect hyperbilirubinemia. In this case, the infant's consistent wet diapers and stools argue against a dehydrated state. Erythrocyte enzyme defect {Choice D) such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency causes increased hemolysis of red blood cells and a subsequent increase in unconjugated bilirubin.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient's immunocompromise and vesicular eruption is consistent with reactivation of varicella zoster virus in the form of herpes zoster infection. Varicella zoster virus infection (VZV), also known as human herpesvirus-3 (HHV-3), is transmitted via respiratory secretions and direct contact with infected skin lesions. It causes two diseases: varicella and herpes zoster. Varicella causes chickenpox in immunocompetent children which is characterized by a pruritic, asynchronous rash with fluid-filled vesicles that crust. The vesicles heal as crusted papules and lesions are in various stages of healing. Varicella can cause encephalitis and pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients, such as an individual being treated with chemotherapy. Herpes zoster is caused by the recurrence of VZV after it has been reactivated from its dormancy in the dorsal root ganglion of a spinal nerve. It commonly presents as a unilateral, dermatomal erythematous patch with overlying clear to yellow, grouped vesicles. It can be associated with neuropathic pain which can precede and outlast the rash. However, post-herpetic neuralgia is more common in elderly patients than pediatric patients. The thoracic spinal nerves and trigeminal nerve are particularly common distributions of reactivation. Treatment for herpetic infections, including herpes zoster infections, involves medications that inhibit viral DNA polymerase, classically by guanosine analogs such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir.",

The disease has an autoimmune cause and is characterized by joint pain and inflammation. Patients commonly exhibit extra-articular manifestations such as uveitis, lymphadenopathy, and rash. There are a variety of sub-categories of JIA. For example, oligoarticular disease is characterized by the involvement of fewer than five joints (typically large joints such as the knee) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity; polyarticular disease is characterized by involvement of greater than five joints (typically both large and small joints such as the interphalangeal joints), uveitis, and negative ANA titers, and systemic disease (also known as juvenile onset Still disease) is characterized by variable joint involvement, rash, quotidian fever, and serositis. Diagnosis is often difficult and is based on a combination of characteristic clinical findings and suggestive laboratory tests, such as ANA, rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated peptide, and inflammatory tests such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate. There is no single, confirmatory laboratory test for JIA.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) typically occurs in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus as a result of increased insulin requirements during times of physiologic stress (eg, infection) or insulin nonadherence. DKA occurs as a result of the accumulation of serum ketones in the setting of deficient insulin signaling. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs because of the relative state of starvation created through absent insulin signaling. Patients may present with complaints of fatigue, polyuria, shortness of breath, and diffuse abdominal discomfort. Vital signs may show tachycardia and tachypnea. Laboratory studies typically show increased glucose and ketone concentrations, metabolic acidosis, and a high anion-gap caused by the accumulation of unmeasured anions in serum. In metabolic acidosis, excess hydrogen ions are transported into the cell in exchange for potassium ions to maintain electroneutrality. Insulin promotes intracellular potassium entry, and in DKA, insulin deficiency contributes to the excess cellular shift of potassium to the extracellular space resulting in hyperkalemia despite decreased concentrations of total body potassium as a result of excess urinary excretion. Treatment is through replacement of insulin, volume repletion, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Adrenal insufficiency (Choice A) refers to insufficient production of hormones from the adrenal cortex, which include aldosterone and cortisol; sex hormone deficiency may also be present. Primary adrenal insufficiency can present with deficiencies in both aldosterone and cortisol, whereas secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency tend to affect cortisol only. Insufficient aldosterone production leads to hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Insufficient cortisol can lead to hypoglycemia, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, and depressed mental status. In this patient, DKA is more likely given his history of type 1 diabetes, metabolic acidosis, and hyperglycemia. Excessive potassium intake (Choice C) would be unlikely to cause hyperkalemia in this patient. Kidney potassium filtration typically regulates serum potassium within a normal range, but this can be impaired in end stage kidney disease. In DKA, the kidney excretion of potassium is increased because of osmotic diuresis. Hyperkalemia in this case is as a result of the extracellular shift of potassium and deficient insulin signaling. Hemolysis (Choice D) can result in hyperkalemia because of the release of intracellular potassium into the serum. DKA is unlikely to cause hemolysis. Hemolytic anemia may present with jaundice and increased bilirubin. Respiratory acidosis (Choice E) would be the opposite of what is expected in a patient with DKA. In DKA, metabolic acidosis leads to compensatory respiratory alkalosis. Kussmaul respirations, which are rapid and deep, are a classic physical examination finding.",

Pubertal gynecomastia is caused by a disruption in the normal balance of androgens and estrogens and is common in boys aged 12 to 14 years old, typically when they have a sexual maturity rating of 3, as in this patient. The increased concentrations of estrogen are caused by the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone to estrone and estradiol. On physical examination, gynecomastia may be tender to palpation. Results of laboratory studies will be within reference ranges in pubertal gynecomastia but could be used to delineate other causes of gynecomastia. These other causes include medications (eg, spironolactone, ketoconazole, antiandrogen therapy), liver cirrhosis, germ cell tumors, hypogonadism, and hyperthyroidism.

Compared to normal skin, within a nevus the melanocytes are clustered into nests. Nests are either located in the basal layer of the epidermis, in the dermis, or both. Compared to acquired nevi, CMN are often larger and darker. CMN are classified by their size: small (<1.5 cm), medium (1.5-20 cm), large (>20-40 cm), and giant (>40 cm). Large and giant CMN are at risk for malignant transformation. In this case, the CMN is symmetrical, uniform in color and thickness, and appears to have a rough texture. Hair is present on the inferior aspect which is common in CMN. CMN should be routinely monitored by a dermatologist. If an area within the CMN develops increased thickness or change in color, it should be biopsied to evaluate for presence of melanoma. Provided the CMN does not develop melanoma, they are benign. However, they can be associated with psychological morbidity if they are located in cosmetically sensitive areas of the body and depending on their size.

Selective lgA deficiency describes a decreased or absent concentration of circulating lgA with normal concentrations of lgG, and normal or increased concentrations of lgM. lgA is critical for immune health and functions in two primary ways. First, lgA binds pathogen surface antigens targeting them for opsonization, complement activation, and phagocytosis. Second, lgA coats mucosal surfaces and prevents colonization, adhesion, and invasion by pathogenic microorganisms. lmmunoglobulins are produced by plasma cells, which are terminally differentiated B lymphocytes; as a result, most causal deficiencies are hypothesized to be related to B lymphocyte abnormalities. Despite this, there is clinical heterogeneity in the severity of lgA deficiency. Some patients remain asymptomatic while others suffer from recurrent sinopulmonary infections or otitis media, as is the case for this patient. In younger patients with severe deficiency, failure to thrive is common. Anaphylactic reactions to blood products such as plasma (which contain donor immunoglobulin) are classic but uncommon, as not all patients with lgA deficiency have reactions to blood products. Such severe reactions are most common in patients with undetectable concentrations of lgA; these reactions occur because of the presence of preformed antibodies against lgA, which is a non-native protein in these patients, and thus, a target of immune activation.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This asymptomatic child with mild anemia, microcytosis, and low red cell distribution width (RDW), who is of Southeast Asian heritage most likely has either a- or ~-thalassemia minor. Thalassemia is characterized by the decreased synthesis of globin chains. Normal adult hemoglobin is known as HbA (a~2l and is made of two a-globin chains and two ~-globin chains. There are four a-globin alleles and two ~-globin alleles. Mutations in one or two a-globin alleles or one ~-globin allele causes thalassemia minor. Thalassemia trait is common in Southeast Asia and presents with mild microcytic anemia. Features include the presence of target cells on peripheral blood smear (pictured in the photomicrograph above), a low RDW (which indicates that most erythrocytes are of the same size with little variation), and persistence of microcytosis. Iron concentrations can be measured to rule out iron deficiency. Other cell lines including platelets and white blood cells should be within normal ranges. Hemoglobin electrophoresis can be used to distinguish between a- and ~-thalassemia minor. There is no treatment required for thalassemia minor as the resultant anemia is usually not severe. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Antibiotic-induced autoimmune hemolysis (Choice A) can occur after exposure to penicillins and cephalosporins, but the onset is typically acute and occurs within hours to days. While hemolysis can occur weeks later, it is less common. Additionally, patients would be expected to present with normocytic anemia and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Haptoglobin concentrations can be measured and will be decreased, while the reticulocyte count will typically be increased. Iron deficiency (Choice C) is a common cause of anemia in menstruating women, strict vegans or vegetarians, and those with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding or Celiac disease. It commonly presents with microcytosis, although often with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) that is higher than what is seen in thalassemia, and an increased RDW indicating the release of premature erythrocytes, which are larger, from the bone marrow. The measurement of serum iron and ferritin are used to make the diagnosis. Transient postinfectious bone marrow suppression (Choice D) may occur following viral infections, but more commonly presents with leukopenia, which is not present in this case. In patients with sickle cell disease, infection with parvovirus B19 can cause a transient aplastic crisis and severe anemia. r \" , r-- r ,",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "lgA nephropathy (Berger disease) is a type of nephritic syndrome resulting in episodic gross hematuria, often following an upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract infection. Nephritic syndromes typically present with acute kidney injury with associated hematuria, red blood cell casts, and hypertension. On urinalysis, there will be a significant quantity of red blood cells (RBCs), possible RBC casts, and sub-nephrotic range proteinuria. Serum complement concentrations, including C3, are typically within reference ranges. This differentiates lgA nephropathy from postinfectious glomerulonephritis, which results in decreased serum C3 complement. Additionally, anti-streptolysin O and anti-DNase titers will be negative in lgA nephropathy. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Hemolytic uremic syndrome {Choice A) is caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (O157:H?) and is usually accompanied by bloody diarrhea. This is characterized by a classic triad of thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Hemorrhagic cystitis {Choice B) refers to inflammation of the urinary bladder, which commonly is secondary to an acute bacterial urinary tract infection presenting with dysuria, urinary urgency, and frequency. A typical infectious cystitis presents with increased urinary white blood cells with detectable leukocyte esterase and nitrites on urinalysis, depending on the infectious organism. In hemorrhagic cystitis, red blood cells are also present on urinalysis. Nephrotic syndrome {Choice D) typically presents with excessive proteinuria (>3 g/day) hyperlipidemia, hypoalbuminemia, and peripheral edema. It does not cause hematuria. The most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is minimal change disease. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis {Choice E) is a nephritic syndrome presenting with urinary RBCs and RBC casts, which typically occurs between 2 and 6 weeks after infection with group A ~-hemolytic streptococci.

Viral shedding in the stool can occur prior to the development of symptoms and potentially allow asymptomatic patients to become vectors for disease. Additionally, viral shedding in the stool persists until after the resolution of symptoms. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not as efficacious at removing enteric viruses from the hands or other commonly touched surfaces, although cleaning agents that utilize bleach are effective. It is likely that the 10-day-old newborn acquired rotavirus infection after caregivers came in contact with a surface contaminated by feces from the 2-month-old infant and then touched the younger child without washing their hands properly. Spread of enteric viruses can be reduced by simply by performing routine hand washing, which typically involves rubbing the hands together with soap for at least twenty seconds.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient with generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, diarrhea, and hepatosplenomegaly with leukopenia most likely has acute HIV infection, known as acute retroviral syndrome. The presentation of primary HIV infection can vary significantly between patients, with some experiencing a mild febrile illness while others experience a severe, mononucleosis-like viral syndrome. The time between infection and onset of symptoms is variable, with incubation time lasting several weeks to months. During acute infection, there is a high degree of viral replication followed by widespread infection of CD4+ T lymphocytes. While the T lymphocyte count may decrease transiently, it is often within reference ranges in early HIV infection unless patients present with signs of opportunistic infection. Initial laboratory studies include the use of a fourth generation HIV test, which tests for HIV p24 antigen and antibodies, combined with direct measurement of the HIV viral load using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. It is common in early infection for patients to have a negative fourth generation test but a high viral load; this is known as the window period. Once the diagnosis is made, laboratory studies should be sent for mutational analysis and genotyping, but this should not delay immediate treatment with antiretroviral therapy. Therapy typically includes a combination of at least three different medications from at least two different antiretroviral classes. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, E, and F. Common variable immunodeficiency (Choice A) classically presents between the ages of 20 to 40 years as multiple, recurrent sinus or pulmonary infections, including pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinusitis. Testing will disclose low immunoglobulin concentrations. Selective lgA deficiency (Choice C) describes an absence of lgA with normal concentrations of lgG, and normal or increased concentrations of lgM. Many patients are asymptomatic and do not demonstrate a history of recurrent infections. The classic presentation is anaphylaxis after transfusion of blood products, which occurs as the result of pre-formed anti-lgA antibodies. Severe combined immunodeficiency (Choice D) results from a variety of different mutations and commonly presents with recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections as a result of severe impairment in both B and T-lymphocyte function in infancy.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Meningitis presents with fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status, typically following a prodrome of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, although it can also be concomitant with another infection. It is caused by bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens, although bacterial pathogens usually cause the most acute and severe illness. Physical examination will commonly show a positive Kernig or Brudzinski sign, indicative of meningeal irritation, and can also disclose focal neurologic symptoms or signs of increased intracranial pressure, such as hemiparesis or a sixth cranial nerve palsy. Results of laboratory studies will show leukocytosis, and coagulation studies can show signs of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia, decreased fibrinogen, and increased depending on the specific pathogen. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation is the initial diagnostic step and will show an increased opening pressure, increased white blood cell count with prominent neutrophils, increased protein concentration, and decreased glucose concentration in bacterial meningitis. Culture of the CSF is utilized to diagnose the specific bacterial cause. The most common cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults is Streptococcus pneumoniae, although its incidence has decreased with the pneumococcal vaccine. Risk factors for its development include an immunocompromised state, diabetes mellitus, and chronic heart or lung disease. Treatment involves immediate antibiotic therapy, accompanied by glucocorticoids. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. Cryptococcal meningitis {Choice A) is a fungal meningitis that occurs most commonly in immunocompromised patients, such as those with lymphoma, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or solid organ transplantation. Cryptococcus neoformans can also cause encephalitis and pulmonary cryptococcosis. However, fungal meningitis will show prominent lymphocytes on CSF evaluation, rather than a predominance of neutrophils, as in this patient. Enterovirus meningitis {Choice B) more commonly occurs in patients less than one year of age but can present in children and young adults. Viral meningitis is associated with a normal opening pressure, predominance of lymphocytes, and normal protein and glucose concentrations on CSF evaluation. Herpes simplex encephalitis {Choice C) presents in patients of all ages with fever, headache, seizures, focal neurologic signs, and confusion. Herpes simplex is commonly associated with a significant amount of red blood cells on CSF evaluation, as well as neuroimaging that shows inflammation in the temporal lobe. Neurocysticercosis {Choice D) is an infection caused by the parasitic pork tapeworm Taenia solium that occurs most commonly in endemic rural regions of Latin America, Asia, and Africa.

A 2-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of episodes of turning blue while playing over the past 6 months ; the episodes have been increasing in frequency over the past month and occur most often when she is\nagitated . She was born at term and weighed 3317 g (7 lb 5 oz). She has a normal diet for her age . She is at the 25th percentile for height and weight. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F) , pulse is 100/min , respirations are\n26/min , and blood pressure is 80/46 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 87% . The lungs are clear to auscultation . There is a heave at the left sternal border . A grade 3/6, harsh systolic murmur is\nheard at the left sternal border with radiation to the axilla . An x-ray of the chest shows decreased pulmonary vascularity and a prominent right ventricle .\nCorrect Answer: C.\nCongenital heart disease refers to a spectrum of disorders caused by structural deformities of the heart and great vessels during embryonic development. These disorders are often subdivided into cyanotic and non-cyanotic\ntypes depending on the direction of blood shunting. Structural heart defects that result in flow of deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary to systemic circulations (a right-to-left shunt) classically present with cyanosis,\nrespiratory distress, hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension generally within a few days of birth. Common culprit lesions include truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great vessels, tricuspid atresia, tetralogy of\nFallo!, and total anomalous pulmonary venous return. Left-to-right shunting occurs with ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, and patent ductus arteriosus. The chronic additional influx of blood into the pulmonary\ncirculation can result in pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy over time with reversal of the shunt to right-to-left (Eisenmenger syndrome). Patients typically present with dyspnea on exertion and cyanosis .\nIncorrect Answers: A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K.\nAsthma (Choice A) is characterized by reversible obstruction to airflow caused by the spasm of smooth muscle in the small airways. It is often triggered by an allergen (eg, smoke, pollen), exercise, or temperature change.\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia (Choice B) is a neonatal lung disorder associated with oxygen exposure and mechanical ventilation in preterm infants. The lungs fail to mature properly, and patients develop chronic lung disease\ncharacterized by decreased lung volumes, hyperinflation, and atelectasis.\nCystic fibrosis (Choice D) can result in cyanosis as a result of chronic lung infections with obstruction and chronic inflammatory changes to the lung parenchyma. Patients typically present with recurrent pneumonia and\ngastrointestinal symptoms.\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Choice E) is a congenital heart condition characterized by myocardial thickening and left outflow tract obstruction. Patients typically present with a murmur and may develop diastolic dysfunction .\nIdiopathic pulmonary hypertension (Choice F) is a rare pulmonary disorder with an unknown cause characterized by progressive pulmonary vascular hypertension. Persistent pulmonary hypertension (Choice I) with any cause\nmay result in right heart failure. Patients typically present with exertional dyspnea and physical examination findings suggestive of right heart failure.\nMethemoglobinemia (Choice G) is the accumulation of hemoglobin with an oxidized iron atom that is unable to transport oxygen, resulting in hypoxia. Infants are more susceptible than adults. It is associated with exposure to\nan oxidizing agent.\nPatent foramen ovale (Choice H) is a common form of atrial septal defect that is typically asymptomatic but can result in a left-to-right shunt and potential for systemic embolization of venous thromboses. Physical examination\nmay disclose wide, fixed splitting of the S heart sound.\n2\nPneumococcal pneumonia (Choice J) is a common infection of the lung parenchyma.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Anaphylactic shock, a severe type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, presents following exposure to an allergen. It is caused by widespread lgE-mediated mast cell degranulation and is characterized by histaminergic responses within multiple organ systems leading to flushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and vasodilation, which can lead to airway obstruction and circulatory collapse. If not managed promptly, death can occur from hypoxia or distributive shock. Anaphylaxis is a form of distributive shock, which is characterized by a primary reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). This reduction in SVR is secondary to lgE-mediated histamine and cytokine release. Cardiac output increases to compensate for low SVR in the early stages of distributive shock. If the inciting state is not appropriately treated, further decompensation can occur, resulting in progressive hypotension and insufficient perfusion with associated end-organ damage. After the administration of epinephrine, fluid resuscitation should be initiated to increase intravascular volume to support adequate organ perfusion.",

In patients between the ages of 2 and 5 years, viral pneumonia is most common. Bacterial pathogens include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Staphylococcus aureus. The risk for H. influenzae type b infection is reduced in patients with up-to-date immunizations. Staphylococcus aureus commonly expresses beta-lactamases, which confer resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics such as amoxicillin, and combination therapy with a beta-lactam or a beta-lactamase inhibitor (eg, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) is recommended.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Galactosemia is the most likely diagnosis in this exclusively breast-fed patient with hepatomegaly and the presence of reducing substances in the urine. Normal metabolism of lactose involves separation into glucose and galactose by lactase. Free glucose can be used for cellular energy production while galactose must be converted to galactose-1-phosphate by galactokinase and then subsequently converted to UDP-galactose and then glucose-1-phosphate by galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT). While galactosemia can result from deficiencies in several different enzymes in this pathway, deficiency of GALT causes classic galactosemia, which is an autosomal recessive disorder. Breast milk contains galactose, which patients with galactosemia are unable to break down. Early complications include jaundice, vomiting, hepatomegaly, diarrhea, lethargy, and occasionally sepsis with Gram-negative organisms. Coagulopathy and easy bruising may also occur. Diagnosis is made by assessing for the presence and activity of GALT in erythrocytes by radioimmunoassay. Reducing substances are molecules that can convert cupric to cuprous ions in the urine and include glucose, lactose, pentose, and galactose. The presence of these substances (galactose) can suggest the diagnosis but is not specific. Additionally, while galactosemia is detected on newborn screening, manifestations of the disease can occur before the results of screening are available. Treatment requires eliminating dietary galactose and providing necessary supplements, however, this may not reverse neurologic sequelae of the disease, such as infantile cataracts and intellectual disability.",

SVT is often idiopathic and paroxysmal but may occur secondary to accessory pathways in some children with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Diagnosis is made by ECG, although some children may require cardiac monitoring in order to capture a paroxysmal event. AV nodal blockade with adenosine is the first line treatment for narrow complex SVT. Adenosine is a purine analogue that acts on the adenosine receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor that signals through adenylate cyclase. In the AV node, binding of the adenosine Arreceptor leads to cellular hyperpolarization and reduced transmission of supraventricular action potentials. If adenosine fails, synchronized cardioversion may be attempted. Children who are old enough may be trained to use vagal maneuvers in order to naturally induce AV nodal blockade.

It antagonizes NMDA receptors leading to excitatory neurotransmitter release, inhibits reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, and stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors. Acute PCP intoxication can lead to psychosis, bizarre behavior, agitation, aggression, rotatory nystagmus, and ataxia. Patients may be diaphoretic, tachycardic, and hypertensive because of sympathomimetic effects. Chronic PCP use can lead to major depressive disorder, psychotic symptoms, memory loss, and dysarthria. Control of psychomotor agitation is the first step in management of patients with PCP intoxication for the safety of the patient and medical staff. Chemical sedation with benzodiazepines such as intramuscular lorazepam or midazolam can be administered to control symptoms. Once a patient is adequately sedated, further evaluation can be completed to assess for traumatic injuries or complications of PCP intoxication such as rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, hypertension, seizures, encephalopathy, or a comatose state.",

Type 1 diabetes mellitus can also be complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and patients can present with DKA as their initial manifestation. DKA can also result from increased insulin requirements during times of physiologic stress (eg, infection) or insulin nonadherence. DKA occurs as a result of the accumulation of serum ketones such as beta-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone in the setting of deficient insulin signaling. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs because of the relative state of starvation created through absent insulin signaling. Type 1 diabetes mellitus can also result in dehydration caused by hyperglycemia, glucosuria, and osmotic diuresis. This diuresis can result in dehydration, ketonuria, and orthostasis. Orthostatic vital signs are significant pulse increases greater than 20/min, systolic pressure decreases over 20 mm Hg, or diastolic pressure decreases over 10 mm Hg with changes in position from supine to seated to standing. Because of the patient's osmotic diuresis, orthostatic hypotension, and dehydration, the first step in care requires the administration of 0.9% saline intravenously for fluid resuscitation.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a defect in adrenal steroid biosynthesis, particularly of cortisol, with variable effects on mineralocorticoids and androgens. Because of decreased production of hormones, the adrenal gland is stimulated by the pituitary in an attempt to increase hormone production, leading to adrenal hyperplasia, the namesake of this condition. The most common form of CAH and the cause of this patient's manifestations is 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase deficiency presents with salt wasting in a newborn or precocious puberty in a child, as well as virilization of infants with an XX karyotype (eg, clitoral hypertrophy, labial fusion), caused by increased concentrations of androgens. Because of the enzyme deficiency, concentrations of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone are increased, while aldosterone and cortisol are decreased, leading to hypotension, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (caused by inadequate cortisol). Diffuse hyperpigmentation of the skin, as seen in this newborn, is characteristic. Melanin production is regulated in part by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). MSH is a byproduct of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) which also produces adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In adrenal insufficiency, stimulation of ACTH production by POMC simultaneously produces MSH, leading to diffuse hyperpigmentation in affected patients. Treatment of CAH consists of exogenous glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid supplementation.",

Risk factors for the development of gonorrhea include multiple sexual partners, new sexual partners, receptive anal intercourse, a young age, substance abuse, and inconsistent condom usage.

When torsed, the appendix testis may appear as a small blue or black mass in the scrotum. The diagnosis may be made clinically, or with ultrasound in cases where testicular torsion cannot be excluded.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The recommended schedule of hepatitis B immunization and immunoprophylaxis in newborns is dependent on the maternal HBsAg status. HBsAg assay is an important component of prenatal care and is typically checked at the first prenatal visit. If HBsAg is positive or if there are signs of active maternal hepatitis B infection, the newborn should receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) intramuscularly and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) as early as possible, with additional doses of HBV at 2 and 6 months of age. In a HBsAg negative mother, only HBV is needed and doses are given at birth, 2 months, and 6 months. As in this case, if the mother's HBsAg status is unknown but there is no evidence of active infection, the newborn should receive HBV within 12 hours and HBIG can be delayed until the maternal serologies have returned. If the serology returns positive for HBsAg, the infant should receive HBIG within 1 week. If the serology returns negative for HBsAg, the newborn does not require HBIG.

Retinoblastoma is a malignant proliferation of retinal neuroendocrine cells and is the most common ophthalmic malignancy in children. Retinoblastoma results from inactivating mutations of both copies of the RB1 gene, which functions as a tumor suppressor by halting cell cycle progression at the G1 checkpoint. RB1 mutations may be either acquired or inherited. In cases of germline RB1 mutation, a single mutated allele is inherited, and the second allele acquires a subsequent mutation during development. Infants who carry germline mutations are more likely to have bilateral retinoblastoma with multiple foci of tumors in the eye, whereas infants with two acquired mutations are more likely to have unilateral retinoblastoma. Ultrasound of the eye is helpful for defining the size of the lesion and for detecting characteristic intralesional calcifications. Within the eye, large tumor size, tumor seeding of the vitreous humor, and involvement of the iris or anterior chamber are associated with a worse prognosis. If undetected, retinoblastoma may invade the optic nerve, leading to a greater risk for metastasis to the brain. Most cases of retinoblastoma may be successfully managed with chemotherapy, although advanced cases may require enucleation with special attention paid to achieving negative margins at the optic nerve, as cases that have undergone metastasis have a poor prognosis.",

Foreign body aspiration can cause obstruction of the airway, leading to impaired oxygenation and ventilation. Children from 1 to 3 years old are at increased risk for foreign body aspiration because of their ability to stand and mobilize independently, ability to grasp and put small objects into their mouths, and an immature swallowing mechanism. Foreign bodies can be located anywhere in the airway between the larynx and the bronchi. Children can present with severe respiratory distress, cyanosis, and stridor, or may have a less severe presentation with partial airway obstruction, presenting with cough, tachypnea, decreased air entry on auscultation, or wheezing. Chest x-ray can show hyperinflation of one lung, which is caused by air trapping and partial airway obstruction in which air is able to pass via inspiration, but not exhalation. Foreign bodies are typically in the right lung because of the more vertical anatomic position of the right main bronchus. Management of foreign body aspiration involves flexible or rigid bronchoscopy to remove the object. Object removal is necessary and retained foreign bodies can be complicated by airway inflammation and infection.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Meningitis in infants is commonly caused by bacteria and can present with fever or hypothermia, lethargy, irritability, altered mental status, a bulging fontanelle, poor feeding, and seizures. Diagnosis of meningitis typically involves lumbar puncture, and evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid will show an increased white blood cell count with predominant neutrophils, increased protein, and decreased glucose. Thorough evaluation also includes a complete blood count, blood culture, and urine culture to evaluate for other causes of sepsis, as well as culture of the cerebrospinal fluid to determine the causative organism. This patient has signs of sepsis, a systemic inflammatory syndrome that may occur in response to infection. Sepsis can be complicated by shock and multiorgan failure with a high mortality rate. Septic shock is characterized by vasoplegia (impaired response of the vasculature to vasoconstricting stimuli) with markedly decreased systemic vascular resistance, tachycardia, increased cardiac output, oliguria, and lactic acidosis. The initial step for management in septic shock involves emergency antibiotics and fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids, such as 0.9% saline. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Administration of dopamine (Choice A) or epinephrine (Choice B) may be indicated in this patient if the patient continues to be hypotensive after a trial of fluid resuscitation. Fluid administration should be the initial step for resuscitation of septic shock. Administration of sodium bicarbonate (Choice D) would be unlikely to be beneficial in this patient, as this patient's pH is normal. Administration of sodium bicarbonate may be helpful in patients who are acidotic. Endotracheal intubation (Choice E) would not be emergently indicated in this patient as the patient is breathing, ventilating, and oxygenating well as shown on arterial blood gas analysis. The patient's hypotension and hemodynamic instability would also cause increased risk for cardiac arrest if endotracheal intubation were attempted.",

Patients who develop AA after a viral infection usually present with pancytopenia within 6 months after diagnosis, but symptoms related to pancytopenia such as fatigue, exercise intolerance , pallor, and petechiae, often appear sooner. Diagnosis includes bone marrow biopsy and aspiration, which will show a profoundly hypocellular bone marrow with a paucity of progenitor cells of all lineages with replacement by fat and stroma.

HIV transmission may occur at any time during gestation but is most commonly acquired at or around the time of delivery and in the immediate postpartum period during breastfeeding. Transmission is uncommon if the mother is taking antiretroviral therapy and has a decreased HIV viral load. As a result of screening for HIV in most developed countries, the incidence of perinatal and pediatric HIV infection has decreased, although this is not true around the world. While many pediatric patients with perinatally acquired HIV infection will manifest symptoms within the first few months to years, it has been recognized that a subpopulation of patients will not develop symptoms or AIDS-defining conditions until many years later, as in this case. Symptoms in children are non-specific, and AIDS-defining conditions in children younger than six vary slightly from those in older children and adults. Clues to the diagnosis in this case include the presence of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in the patient's mother, which is an AIDS-defining illness and should prompt evaluation for HIV infection in this patient.",

Pertussis classically presents in three stages. The catarrhal stage is first, which presents with fever, rhinorrhea, and a mild cough. This progresses to the paroxysmal stage after 1 to 2 weeks, in which patients experience violent bouts of extreme coughing, at times violent enough to cause secondary traumatic injury such as rib fractures, urinary incontinence, pneumothorax, and facial petechiae. Often, such coughing fits are accompanied by cyanosis and may be followed by syncope, emesis, or apnea. The paroxysmal stage can last for weeks to months. Symptoms resolve during the convalescent stage, which lasts from 1 to 4 weeks. Pertussis can be prevented with immunization in the form of acellular pertussis, typically administered along with tetanus and diphtheria vaccines (DTaP). It can be transmitted in respiratory droplets, thus all individuals who come into contact with infected patients should wear a mask and eye protection.",

It is also associated with signs of insulin resistance, such as acanthosis nigricans and increased blood glucose concentrations. PCOS is caused by an abnormal hypothalamic hormonal feedback response, that is caused by a primary functional ovarian hyperandrogenism (increased androgens produced by the theca lutein cells), which leads to increased luteinizing hormone (LH) in comparison to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Treatment includes weight loss, combined oral contraceptives for menstrual regulation, and spironolactone or ketoconazole for hirsutism.

Pertussis occurs because of an infection from Bordetella pertussis and classically presents in three stages. The catarrhal stage is first, which presents with fever, rhinorrhea, and a mild cough. This progresses to the paroxysmal stage after one to two weeks, in which patients experience violent bouts of extreme coughing, at times violent enough to cause secondary traumatic injury such as rib fractures, urinary incontinence, and pneumothorax. Often, such coughing fits are accompanied by cyanosis and may be followed by syncope, emesis, or apnea. The paroxysmal stage can last for weeks to months. Symptoms resolve during the convalescent stage, which lasts from one to four weeks. Pertussis toxin causes impaired recruitment and migration of phagocytes and production of inflammatory mediators. Patients often have significant lymphocytosis. Pertussis can be prevented with immunization in the form of acellular pertussis, typically administered along with tetanus and diphtheria vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends administering the vaccine in a multiple dose series beginning at two months of age. Pertussis is treated with antibiotics (typically macrolides) and supportive care.",

The causes of Al, also called aortic regurgitation, include bicuspid aortic valve, aortic root dilation, and a history of rheumatic heart disease. It is also commonly associated with syndromes such as Marfan and Turner syndrome. Al results from an incompetent aortic valve that allows retrograde blood flow from the aortic root to the left ventricle (LV) during diastole. This results in an increased LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) as both blood from the aorta and the left atrium fill the LV. Increased volume stretches the compliant ventricle thereby increasing myocardial contractility, which is reflected as an increased stroke volume (SV) and a comparatively increased cardiac output. Over time, eccentric hypertrophy of the LV leads to loss of normal compliance and progressive LV systolic dysfunction.",

Left ventricular pressure overload (",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Congenital megacolon (also known as Hirschsprung disease or intestinal aganglionosis) is caused by the congenital absence of the distal portion of the myenteric plexus, a part of the enteric nervous system located between the inner and outer layers of the muscularis externa in the bowel wall. During development, this plexus migrates cephalad to caudal and incomplete migration results in absence of the plexus in the distal portion of the gastrointestinal tract. This often leads to an inability to pass meconium within the first few days of life and, eventually, large bowel obstruction. An explosive expulsion of feces on rectal examination is a common clinical finding. Barium enema is used to evaluate for congenital megacolon in children. Congenital megacolon is associated with Down syndrome. Patients with Down syndrome are also at increased risk for dementia (Alzheimer type), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, cardiac septal defects, and duodenal atresia.",
      "distractor_explanations": {

Duodenal atresia presents with vomiting and abdominal distension, as well as distension of the stomach and duodenum on abdominal x-ray. Like congenital megacolon, duodenal atresia is more common in children with Down syndrome. Pancreatic enzyme insufficiency (",
        "D": "is seen in cystic fibrosis because of destruction of the pancreatic duct. The absence of the digestive enzymes made by the pancreas leads to malnutrition (eg, cachexia, muscle wasting), weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and frequent, loose, foul-smelling, sometimes oily stools (steatorrhea). Cystic fibrosis may also present with meconium ileus, another cause of failure to pass stool after birth. However, this patient's presentation is more characteristic of congenital megacolon. Villous atrophy (",
        "E": "in the small bowel is a characteristic finding of Celiac disease. Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy which causes inflammatory infiltration of the proximal small bowel, which leads to characteristic intraepithelial lymphocytosis, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. Malabsorption of substances in the proximal small bowel ensues, which presents symptomatically as chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, and nutritional deficiencies."

This patient with evidence of hemolytic anemia, increased reticulocyte count, and a family history of similar symptoms requiring splenectomy likely has hereditary spherocytosis (HS). HS can occur if there are mutations in one or more proteins that link the erythrocyte inner membrane skeleton to the outer lipid bilayer, and include mutations in spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, and band 4.2. These mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Spherocytosis results from progressive loss of the erythrocyte membrane over time and gives the erythrocytes a spherical shape; the surface area decreases but the volume of the cell remains unchanged. This impairs the erythrocyte's ability to confirm in small vessels of the microcirculation, especially within the spleen , where spherocytes accumulate. Patients often present with splenomegaly, hemolytic anemia, and pigmented gallstones. Peripheral smear will show normocytic, normochromic erythrocytes and, if there is a high degree of hemolysis, reticulocytes, which appear as larger, pale blue erythrocytes.

Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive condition and is therefore more commonly seen in males, while most females are silent carriers. It is caused by an absence or deficiency of factor VIII, which is a component of the intrinsic clotting cascade. Factor VIII is required as a cofactor for the activation of factor X to factor Xa, which in turn converts prothrombin to thrombin to complete the process of clot formation. The PTT measures the activity of the intrinsic pathway and will be prolonged in cases of hemophilia A, while the PT measures the activity of factor VII (extrinsic pathway), which is normal in patients with this disease.",

Flexural dermatitis (eg, in the antecubital fossae) is a common pattern in children and adults with atopic dermatitis, but babies demonstrate a unique pattern, which primarily involves the bilateral cheeks and diaper area, as these areas are both frequently moist and subject to irritation. Treatment of atopic dermatitis begins with gentle skin care: minimizing long baths in warm water which causes drying of the skin, avoiding products with fragrance, and use of bland moisturizers such as petroleum jelly daily. In the case of an infant, keeping the cheeks dry and frequent diaper changes are also important. Flares of eczema are treated with mild- to moderate-potency topical corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone. In children, a moderate-potency topical corticosteroid should not be used consistently for over 2 to 3 weeks because of the potential of systemic absorption, particularly in the diaper area.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Precocious puberty is defined as the onset of pubertal development and secondary sexual characteristics prior to 8 years of age in girls and 9 years of age in boys. Precocious puberty can be central, which is caused by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This early activation can be idiopathic or caused by central nervous system abnormalities, such as a brain tumor. Precocious puberty can also be peripheral, which is caused by the release of excess sex hormones from the gonads or adrenal glands, or potentially the ectopic production of human chorionic gonadotropin from a germ-cell tumor. Initial evaluation involves the measurement of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone {LH), and estradiol or testosterone, which allows the provider to differentiate between central and peripheral causes of precocious puberty. Central precocious puberty is further evaluated with brain imaging, whereas peripheral precocious puberty is further evaluated with ultrasonography of the testes, ovaries, or adrenal glands. Treatment is dependent on the underlying pathology. As testicular size is based on the production of FSH, this patient more likely has a peripheral cause of precocious puberty with hyperandrogenism leading to inhibition of the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), FSH, and LH. Adrenal causes of precocious puberty include congenital adrenal hyperplasia and androgen-secreting tumors. Treatment for precocious puberty is dependent on the underlying pathology.",

        "C": "does not typically produce hormones. It does play a role in the metabolism of estrogen, thus a patient with liver cirrhosis can develop signs of hyperestrogenism, such as gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities, spider angiomata, and palmar erythema. However, liver failure is not a common cause of precocious puberty in children. Excess hormone production from the pituitary gland {",
        "D": "could lead to central precocious puberty with increased concentrations of FSH and LH.

        "E": "can present with the peripheral precocious puberty seen in this patient.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a sexually transmitted bacterium that initially causes cervicitis, urethritis, or pharyngitis and may hematogenously disseminate to cause septic arthritis. Septic arthritis classically presents with a painful, erythematous, swollen joint along with systemic signs and symptoms of illness such as fever, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, and nausea. Gonococcal arthritis may present with monoarticular or asymmetric polyarticular disease and may feature adjacent tenosynovitis and dermatitis. The most common sites of gonococcal infection are the knee, ankle, wrist, and elbow, though the sternoclavicular joint may also be affected. In all causes of septic arthritis, serum laboratory values typically show leukocytosis along with increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein concentrations. Diagnosis requires arthrocentesis, which typically demonstrates purulent aspirate fluid with an increased concentration of neutrophil-predominant white blood cells.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Graves disease is an autoimmune hyperthyroid condition caused by thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies that activate the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor. Hyperstimulation of the TSH receptor leads to overproduction of thyroid hormone and a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland on physical examination, along with signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism including weight loss, insomnia, palpitations, heat intolerance, warm skin, tremor, diaphoresis, and pretibial myxedema. TSH-receptor-stimulating antibodies also stimulate orbital fibroblasts and lead to thyroid ophthalmopathy, which is characterized by the expansion of orbital fat and connective tissue with resultant exophthalmos, lid lag, and restrictive strabismus. Thyroid ophthalmopathy may lead to diplopia, corneal exposure, compressive optic neuropathy, and a cosmetic appearance that is distressing for patients. Thyroid laboratory studies typically demonstrate primary hyperthyroidism with increased thyroxine and triiodothyronine, and decreased TSH. Radioactive iodine uptake nuclear scintigraphy typically demonstrates diffuse, abnormally increased uptake of the thyroid gland without a discrete nodule. Graves disease is treated with antithyroid drugs such as methimazole and propylthiouracil, and radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid gland. Thyroid ophthalmopathy typically responds well to topical lubrication, although severe cases may require intravenous corticosteroids and a staged surgical approach.",

These neoplasms present as red or purple subcutaneous tumors. The increased blood flow may cause the affected area to be warm and swollen or even cause a limb length discrepancy. Signs of other hemangiomas, such as a bruit over the liver, may also be present. The large, convoluted vascular architecture causes platelet adhesion and trapping. This trapping leads to consumption offibrinogen and ongoing fibrinolysis, causing a consumptive coagulopathy.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Neonatal sepsis is categorized often on the basis of time from parturition, since the period of time in which symptoms begin may indicate which pathogen is likely involved, thereby guiding therapy. Early-onset neonatal sepsis (within 72 hours of birth) is marked by symptoms of lethargy, seizures, poor feeding, weak cry, and hypotonia. It presents with tachycardia, tachypnea, occasionally fever, and often with an examination that is nonfocal. If examination findings are present, they may reflect the source of infection or may reflect complications of sepsis such as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Early-onset neonatal sepsis generally occurs as a result of pathogens acquired from the mother, either through hematogenous or transplacental spread or, commonly, contact acquisition in the birth canal. The most common pathogens associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis include Streptococcus agalactiae (group B), Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Listeria monocytogenes. Syndromes of serious bacterial infection include bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia. Late-onset neonatal sepsis (presenting 72 hours or more after birth) more commonly occurs from environmental pathogens in addition to those acquired from the mother. Pneumonia is more common in early-onset sepsis, and presents with cough, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia, increased work of breathing, and rhonchi on auscultation. Workup for any suspected case of sepsis in a child younger than 30 days of age is broad, and should include a complete blood count, urinalysis, blood cultures, chest x-ray, and lumbar puncture at a minimum, since symptoms in this population are vague and nonspecific, limiting the utility of the history and physical examination to guide workup.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is typically associated with infection from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H? caused by the production of Shiga toxin. It classically presents in children with bloody diarrhea accompanied by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. Other pathogenic precipitants include S. pneumoniae, Salmonella species, and Shigel/a species infections. This patient presents following several days of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, suggesting a bacterial or viral trigger. The abrupt change of pallor and lethargy, along with red urine and falling urine output suggests the presence of both anemia and renal failure. Physical examination may show petechiae, purpura, or ecchymosis, all of which are signs of thrombocytopenia. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates thrombocytopenia, increased creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentrations, and often multiple electrolyte derangements depending on the extent of volume depletion and acute renal failure. Treatment is supportive and may include plasma exchange; many cases self-resolve. Generally, platelet transfusion is contraindicated because of the risk for worsening the degree of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia since platelet administration has been postulated to worsen the degree of thrombosis. If fever and neurologic symptoms are concomitantly present along with the anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is diagnosed. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Goodpasture syndrome (Choice A) is a type II (complement-mediated cytotoxic) hypersensitivity reaction that involves autoimmune deposition of lgG against the basement membrane in the lung and kidney. Patients present with hemoptysis and nephritic syndrome, which may be rapidly progressive and cause renal failure or death if not treated. Henoch-Schonlein nephritis (Choice C) is a vasculitis that classically presents in a child with renal failure and palpable purpura on the lower extremities following an upper respiratory infection. Patients often complain of arthralgias and abdominal pain, and intussusception is a known complication. Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (Choice D) is a nephritic syndrome presenting with gross or microscopic hematuria, peripheral or periorbital edema, and hypertension in a child, typically two weeks after infection with group A ~-hemolytic streptococci. Laboratory evaluation may show low serum C3 concentrations and positive anti-streptolysin O and anti-DNase titers. Systemic vasculitis (Choice E) describes a broad class of diseases that encompass small, medium, and large arterial inflammation affecting various organ systems, commonly the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and lung. While vasculitides may present following illness, the classic triad of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure makes HUS a more likely diagnosis. r \" , r-- r ,",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "An ECG should be obtained in this patient with unexplained exertional syncope. There are several high-risk cardiac conditions that can present with syncope in pediatric patients, and these can be classified as structural defects, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery anomalies, or valvular aortic stenosis, or can be a result of electrical abnormalities, such as long QT syndrome or Brugada syndrome. Evaluation with ECG is mandatory in all patients with unexplained syncope. Of these, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is one of the more common causes of syncope. It is generally inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and may be the cause of death in this patient's cousin. Syncope occurs as a result of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction with a consequent decrease in cardiac output leading to decreased cerebral perfusion and syncope. Decreased perfusion of the coronary arteries can cause angina and increase the risk for ventricular arrhythmias, although this is not always seen. ECG classically demonstrates left ventricular hypertrophy with non-specific T wave abnormalities in the precordial leads. Deep, narrow, symmetric Q waves may also be seen in the lateral and inferior leads. Echocardiography should be subsequently performed to evaluate the underlying cardiac anatomy, which would allow for assessment of the degree of LVOT obstruction, if present.",

On examination, passive movement of the patella demonstrates increased sliding of the patella in either the lateral axis or superior-inferior axis. The patella may also be tender to palpation. The mainstay of treatment for patellar instability is activity modification and physical therapy. The goal of physical therapy is to strengthen the surrounding muscles and recruit stability of the patella from these muscles, as well as improve the position and balance of the limb overall.

It is exacerbated by overuse and activities that put weight on a flexed knee, such as running and jumping. On examination, passive movement of the patella demonstrates increased sliding of the patella in either the lateral axis or superior-inferior axis. The patella may also be tender to palpation. The mainstay of treatment for patellar instability is activity modification and physical therapy. The goal of physical therapy is to strengthen the surrounding muscles and recruit stability of the patella from these muscles, as well as improve the position and balance of the limb overall. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be prescribed for use as needed.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cardiac output is most likely to be increased in this patient with severe anemia secondary to sickle cell disease (SCD). Adequate oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues occurs in several steps: oxygenation of the lung alveoli, binding of oxygen to hemoglobin in erythrocytes, and delivery of oxygenated erythrocytes to peripheral tissues with an adequate cardiac output. Peripheral oxygen delivery is mathematically defined by the product of the cardiac output and the arterial oxygen content. Arterial oxygen content is significantly lower in the setting of severe anemia, as in this patient, because there is a substantially lower hemoglobin content. As such, cardiac output must increase to accommodate a substantially lower arterial oxygen content if oxygen delivery to the peripheral tissues is to remain the same. This phenomenon accounts for the patient's active precordium and grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur. Additionally, this patient likely suffers from a component of sepsis given his persistent upper respiratory tract infection and fever, which would increase the patient's risk for concomitant septic shock. In the early stages of septic shock, the cardiac output is also increased in an attempt to maintain mean arterial pressure.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Complement system immunodeficiency is the most likely diagnosis in this patient with meningococcemia. Late component complement deficiency (CS to C9) is a common finding in patients who have recurrent infections with Neisseria species, and increases susceptibility to this pathogen through failure to form the membrane attack complex (MAC). Complement activation can occur through the classical, lectin, or alternative pathways, with each pathway converging at the point where C3 is cleaved by C3 convertase, releasing C3a and C3b. Following this, C3b is incorporated into the C3 convertase complex, which subsequently acts on CS convertase to lower the Km (increase the affinity) of CS convertase for its substrate, CS. Cleavage of CS results in the formation of C5a, a potent chemoattractant, and C5b. C5b complexes with C6, C7, CB, and C9 (terminal complement factors) to form the MAC, which allows for the creation of a transmembrane pore that interferes with the integrity of the cellular membrane, leading to cell lysis. Deficiencies of terminal complement factors impair the formation of the MAC and preferentially predispose patients to infection with Neisseria species. While most patients experience mild infection with atypical serotypes, they can also develop fulminant meningococcemia from typical Neisseria serotypes, as in this patient. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, E, and F. AIDS (Choice A) can develop in pediatric patients who have acquired the infection vertically during the perinatal period from a mother with untreated HIV infection. Most patients present with evidence of recurrent pneumonia, infection with atypical organisms such as Mycobacterium avium, or with opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia. It commonly presents within months of birth but can also develop many years after birth. Child abuse (Choice B) should be suspected in cases where bruising is located in atypical locations such as the back or is with an atypical appearance, such as a linear mark on the upper arm. Purpura on the trunk and extremities is classic for meningococcemia and is far more likely in this patient with sepsis and a family history of meningococcemia. Congenital humoral system immunodeficiency (Choice D) is caused by numerous syndromes, including X-linked agammaglobulinemia, whereby B lymphocyte development is impaired by mutations in the BTK gene. Low or absent immunoglobulin secretion increases the risk for recurrent bacterial infections, but patients present within the first eighteen months of life. Increased susceptibility to Neisseria species, in particular, is not characteristic of this disease. Frequent exposure to multiple pathogens (Choice E) is incorrect. Healthy children are exposed to numerous pathogens on a daily basis and most do not develop invasive bacterial infections. While Neisseria meningitidis is associated with outbreaks in college dorms and military barracks, there is no such history in this case. Vitamin A deficiency (Choice F) is classically associated with xerophthalmia but does not cause the findings described in this patient.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE inhibitors are a first-line treatment for hypertension since they block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin 11, which has direct vasoconstrictive effects and promotes salt and water retention. Additionally, inhibition of angiotensin production has the secondary effect of suppressing aldosterone production. Aldosterone is responsible for the retention of sodium and excretion of potassium, and its suppression may lead to hyperkalemia. Other important potential side effects of ACE inhibitors include cough and angioedema.",

        "B": "does not typically occur as a result of treatment with ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibition leads to dilation of efferent arterioles, which may produce a transient decrease in glomerular filtration rate but does not significantly decrease glomerular perfusion unless the patient has underlying renal artery stenosis.

Starting at age 2 years, toddlers become more curious about their genitalia and associated sensations, along with gender differences.

Sexual behaviors that are concerning for sexual abuse (or violence or neglect in the home) include imitations of specific sexual acts, coercive sexual behavior, and excessive preoccupation with sexual behavior. Toddlers typically demonstrate occasional defiance, and cooperative play is not expected to develop until age 4 years, so this child's inclination not to share her toys is typical.
