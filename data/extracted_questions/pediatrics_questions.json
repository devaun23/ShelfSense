It presents early in childhood with thymic hypoplasia and impaired immunity, conotruncal cardiac defects (eg, truncus arteriosus), hypocalcemia caused by parathyroid hypoplasia, and craniofacial abnormalities, such as low set ears, hypertelorism, micrognathia, and cleft lip and palate. It is associated with developmental delay. Laboratory evaluation will show leukopenia and decreased calcium concentrations, while a chest x-ray may demonstrate the absence of a thymic shadow, as in this patient. Further evaluation typically includes an echocardiography and kidney ultrasonography. Treatment is supportive. This patient presenting with jitteriness in the setting of hypocalcemia and truncus arteriosus likely has DiGeorge syndrome, making hypoparathyroidism the most likely diagnosis.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Puberty in boys typically follows a predictable course of gonadarche (enlargement of the testes), followed by pubarche (pubic hair), followed by adrenarche (axillary hair, facial hair, voice changes), followed by a growth spurt. This differs from the process in girls, which proceeds from thelarche (breast buds) to pubarche to growth spurt and finally menarche. In boys, delayed puberty is defined as the absence of testicular enlargement or secondary sexual characteristics at the age of 14 years. The most common cause of delayed puberty is constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), accounting for approximately 50% of cases, a normal variant. In CDGP, there is a transient defect in the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone with resultant delay in the stimulation of pituitary production of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. CDGP tends to be familial with many members of the same family undergoing late puberty compared with peers. In this case, the patient has undergone gonadarche (indicated by his Tanner stage 2 genital development) and pubarche but has not yet undergone adrenarche. Thus, while delayed, the sequence of his procession through the steps of puberty is appropriate and he can be reassured that his development will continue to progress.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Measurement of serum testosterone concentration is unnecessary in this case because the patient is progressing through the stages of puberty as expected. If his puberty did not continue to progress, testosterone measurement could be used to differentiate CDGP from another pathology. Mild bilateral gynecomastia can be normal in early puberty as a result of the small increase in extragonadal production of estrogen relative to the amount of testosterone being produced. Urine toxicology screening (Choice C) would be appropriate if there was a suspicion for drug use inducing gynecomastia, of which marijuana is the most common recreational drug. Breast biopsy (Choice E) would be indicated if the breast enlargement was caused by a nodule or mass rather than true gynecomastia. If delayed puberty were accompanied by neurologic findings or suspected to be caused by a process involving the brain such as a pituitary adenoma, MRI of the brain, not CT scan of the head (Choice D), would be indicated. Neither imaging modality is necessary in this case."

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening all sexually active adolescent women under the age of 25 years for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. Chlamydia trachomatis is a common sexually transmitted disease that can cause various infections including cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, epididymitis, and urethritis. However, in most cases it is asymptomatic and thus screening asymptomatic individuals is important for disclosing and treating active infections before long-term sequelae develop. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae also commonly co-infect the same individual. This patient's examination demonstrates cervical ectropion, which develops when there is slight eversion of the cervix to expose a portion of the endocervix and its columnar mucosa to the vaginal canal. In young women, it is a normal variant and does not warrant treatment, although it does increase the risk for acquiring sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and HIV.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "testing is not indicated until a patient reaches the age of 30 years old. Prior to that time, cytologic study of cells collected from the cervix alone is adequate for the screening of cervical cancer. After the age of 30, cervical cancer screening may be performed by cytologic study every 3 years or by cytologic study combined with HPV testing every 5 years. Measurement of serum follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormone concentrations (Choice C) is unnecessary since this patient does not demonstrate signs of delayed puberty. There are no indications to suggest an abnormality in this patient's hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine concentrations (Choice D) is unnecessary and not indicated for screening in an asymptomatic individual. Measurement of these laboratory values would be indicated if the patient were showing signs or symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.",
        "E": "Colposcopy is a procedure in which the cervix is visualized under magnification for the purpose of identifying cancerous or precancerous areas to obtain diagnostic samples. Colposcopy is indicated as a follow-up to an abnormal cervical cancer screening test or to further evaluate abnormal findings on initial cervical examination. This patient's ectropion is common in adolescents and is considered a normal variant. There is no indication for colposcopy in this patient."

While many causes of hypothyroidism exist, Hashimoto disease is a common cause of painless thyroiditis, which may present with a palpable, enlarged thyroid gland, as in this patient.

The increased TSH concentration is measurable in serum and provides ongoing trophic stimulation to the thyroid gland. Increased prolactin may cause breast development, galactorrhea, and may promote irregular anovulatory cycles or amenorrhea through feedback on gonadotropin-releasing hormone.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) presents with a heart murmur described as a continuous \"machinery-like\" murmur best heard in the left second intercostal and left infraclavicular regions. Since blood flow through the PDA occurs in both systole and diastole, the sound will be present throughout the cardiac cycle. The ductus arteriosus is one of several physiologic shunts existing during the prenatal period. In utero, oxygenated blood is obtained from the placenta, not from the lungs, and the ductus arteriosus (DA) allows the shunting of oxygenated blood from the pulmonary artery directly to the aorta while bypassing the fetal lungs, which are filled with amniotic fluid. At birth, closure of the DA occurs by the release of prostaglandins and increased arterial oxygen tension. With increased blood oxygenation and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance following birth or with indomethacin use, prostaglandin production falls and the ductus closes. Certain congenital heart diseases require the presence of a shunt to allow arteriovenous admixture of oxygenated blood, for example, transposition of the great vessels. In the absence of such a requirement for shunting, a PDA results in a chronic extracardiac left-to-right shunt that may result in pulmonary hypertension or right-sided heart failure, with the risk for Eisenmenger syndrome if uncorrected.

IDA is extremely prevalent worldwide, especially in developing countries, in pregnant women, and in children. Infants and children are particularly vulnerable to IDA as a result of rapid growth and dietary deficiencies. The patient has been fed primarily cow's milk for the past 6 months, along with table food, while formula was stopped at 6 months of age. This places the infant at risk for iron deficiency given the insufficient amount of iron in cow's milk. Many types of formulas and foods are fortified with iron to ensure appropriate supplementation. Iron is required for the synthesis of heme, which is a necessary component of the hemoglobin molecule, and thus, of erythrocytes. It functions to shuttle oxygen to and from peripheral tissues. Erythrocytes on the peripheral blood smear are hypochromic as a result of deficient hemoglobin concentration. It is hypothesized that erythrocytes are microcytic as a result of continuing erythrocyte division in order to reach an adequate hemoglobin concentration. Because hemoglobin stores are inadequate, cell division continues beyond what would normally occur and causes the cells to be smaller than normal. Treatment in the case of poor dietary intake is with oral iron supplementation. If severe, parenteral iron can be administered.",

Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? A) Cefazolin B) Cefotaxime C) Nafcillin D) Penicillin E) Vancomycin Correct Answer: B. Urinary tract infections are characterized by dysuria, urinary urgency, frequency, or incontinence. In infants, urinary tract infections may present solely with fever, irritability, or fussiness. Urinalysis often shows leukocytes, bacteria, and the presence of nitrites and leukocyte esterase. Risk factors for urinary tract infections include being less than 1 year of age, female, or an uncircumcised male. It should also be suspected especially when there is no other source of infection identified, such as otitis media or upper respiratory tract infection. Urinary tract infections should be treated with antibiotics with sufficient coverage of gram negative rods. Cefotaxime is a third-generation cephalosporin that would be sufficient to treat this patient's urinary tract infection. Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E. Cefazolin (Choice A) is a first-generation cephalosporin. It does have some activity against E. coli but lacks activity against many gram-negative rods. First-generation cephalosporins may be appropriate for a urinary tract infection if culture and sensitivity data support a susceptible organism. A third-generation cephalosporin is a broader choice. Nafcillin (Choice C) is used to treat gram-positive organisms, especially methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. It would not be the antibiotic of choice in a urinary tract infection, which is typically caused by gram negative rods. Similarly, penicillin (Choice D) may be inadequate to treat this urinary tract infection as it has limited coverage of gram-negative bacteria. Vancomycin (Choice E) inhibits bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan formation in gram-positive bacteria by binding to D-Ala-D-Ala. It is effective in the treatment of resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus species. It does not have significant activity against gram-negative pathogens. Educational Objective: In infants, urinary tract infections may present solely with fever, irritability, or fussiness. Urinalysis often shows leukocytes, bacteria, and the presence of nitrites and leukocyte esterase. Urinary tract infections should be treated with antibiotics with sufficient coverage of gram-negative rods. r \" , r-- r ,",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Vascular tumors such as tufted hemangiomas and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma are rare in infancy. Tufted hemangiomas present as firm, red lesions with ill-defined borders on the arms, legs, and trunk, often sparing the head and face. They become larger, darker, and indurated with age, although most stabilize in childhood. Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma is a subcutaneous vascular mass that appears as a purpuric raised lesion, most commonly on the extremities. It also tends to become darker and indurated with time. Both of these vascular tumors are associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, which presents with bleeding, ecchymoses, and petechiae as a result of platelet sequestration by the tumor and an associated coagulopathy. Development of this syndrome typically presents with a rapid enlargement of the tumor, thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and increased concentration. Treatment options include steroids, chemotherapy (eg, vincristine), and immunomodulators (eg, sirolimus).",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Disseminated intravascular coagulation presents with bleeding, thrombocytopenia, increased prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times, decreased plasma fibrinogen concentration, and increased dimer concentration. It can be caused by trauma, severe sepsis, and, occasionally, malignancy. It is less likely than Kasabach-Merritt syndrome in this otherwise healthy patient with a vascular tumor. High-output congestive heart failure (Choice B) presents with shortness of breath, weight gain, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and peripheral edema, often in the setting of an arteriovenous fistula, cirrhosis, sepsis, or severe anemia. It does not present with bruising and petechiae. Impaired tissue growth due to altered vascular supply (Choice C) and increased tissue growth due to increased vascular supply (Choice D) are incorrect, as the altered vascular supply to the vascular tumor does not affect tissue growth. Rather, the altered vasculature sequesters and activates platelets, leading to thrombocytopenia and consumptive coagulopathy."

As well, since the fetus is unable to swallow amniotic fluid, the pregnancy may be complicated by polyhydramnios. Esophageal atresia often occurs with a concomitant tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). The presence of a TEF, depending on the subtype, potentially conveys an increased risk for aspiration pneumonia and respiratory distress. Initial evaluation requires an attempt at insertion of a nasogastric tube and evaluation of its position with a chest x-ray. If the nasogastric tube remains coiled within the esophagus, this suggests the presence of esophageal atresia. Air within the gastrointestinal tract immediately after birth and prior to feeding suggests the existence of a TEF distal to the esophageal atresia. Definitive management requires surgical repair. Additional screening for associated congenital malformations should occur.",

As the esophagus typically terminates in the thorax in the setting of esophageal atresia, ultrasonography of the abdomen does not play a role in its diagnosis.

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (Choice B) is a cause of nephrotic syndrome that can result in proteinuria and pitting edema. FSGS is commonly associated with sickle cell disease, opioid use, and HIV, and is characterized by segmental sclerosis of the glomeruli that is visible on light microscopy. lgA nephropathy (Choice C) is characterized by episodic hematuria that occurs concurrently with upper respiratory tract infections. When lgA deposition occurs in the renal mesangium, glomerulonephritis may ensue, causing microscopic hematuria, erythrocyte casts, and mild to moderate proteinuria. Membranous nephropathy (Choice D) is a nephrotic syndrome which is more common in adults and can be secondary to drugs (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), infections (eg, hepatitis B and C), or systemic lupus erythematosus.

The aspiration of acidic stomach contents may cause aspiration pneumonitis, whereas the aspiration of gastrointestinal flora and bacteria can cause aspiration pneumonia. The volume of aspirate is a strong predictor of complications from aspiration, especially in the case of pneumonia, as the bacterial inoculum may overwhelm the native ability of pulmonary alveolar defense (macrophages, cilia, mucus) to prevent colonization, replication, and infection. Aspiration pneumonia classically presents with a cough productive of foul-smelling sputum, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, and rhonchi on physical examination. Imaging classically shows an infiltrate in the most dependent lung segments at the time of aspiration (eg, in the superior segment of the inferior lobe when supine or lower lobes when erect). Patients at a higher risk for aspiration include those with impaired airway-protective reflexes (eg, neurological injury, myasthenia gravis, altered mental status), frequent or forceful emesis, abnormal pharyngeal or airway anatomy or function (eg, malignancy, tracheoesophageal fistula), or severe gastroesophageal reflux. Options for the management of severe gastroesophageal reflux in children include dietary changes and proton pump inhibitors or histamine- 2 receptor antagonists, although these would not assist in decreasing the risk for aspiration pneumonia. Fundoplication is a surgical procedure that improves the gastroesophageal sphincter tone by wrapping the fundus around the distal esophagus, which decreases the frequency and severity of reflux.",

For this to be effective in preventing aspiration caused by gastroesophageal reflux, the placed tube would have to be placed to suction or to drainage at all times, which would prohibit proper nutrition. Fundoplication is a more reasonable option.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Neuroblastoma is a neoplasm of neuroendocrine cells of the sympathetic nervous system. It may arise from any sympathetic nervous tissue and is the most common tumor of the adrenal gland that occurs in children. Other locations include the sympathetic chain. Adrenal involvement classically presents with abdominal pain and distention, weight loss, and failure to thrive. Patients may also present with an associated paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome. Physical examination may show a firm, nodular mass that crosses the midline and diastolic hypertension. Diagnosis is suggested by the presence of increased catecholamine metabolites in the serum and urine. Neuroblastoma is associated with overamplification of the MYCN oncogene. Histologic characteristics include small round blue cells that may form rosette patterns clustered around a central lumen, with positive stains for bombesin and neuron-specific enolase markers. Neuroblastoma commonly metastasizes to bone and skin. Treatment and prognosis are dependent on the stage of the tumor at diagnosis and the presence or absence of MYCN amplification.",

        "A": "Ewing sarcoma is a primary bone malignancy driven by t(11 ;22) chromosomal translocation. On histology, Ewing sarcoma demonstrates multiple small, round, blue cells. X-rays may demonstrate elevated periosteum and layered neocortex formation. It often occurs in the long bones (eg, femur, tibia) and typically presents in adolescence. Multicystic dysplastic kidney (Choice B) is a nonhereditary pediatric cystic renal disease that results from the formation of multiple renal cysts in utero. It is typically sporadic. It can affect one or both kidneys, with a higher incidence of bilateral involvement in females. The affected kidney is replaced by numerous cysts and retains no functioning renal tissue. Nephroblastoma (Wilms tumor) (Choice D) is the most common renal malignancy in childhood. It occurs secondary to mutations in tumor suppressor genes WT1 or WT2. It is characterized by a large, often palpable, unilateral flank mass and hematuria. It does not typically cross midline and is often smooth to palpation rather than nodular. Polycystic kidney disease (Choice E) refers to either autosomal recessive or dominant polycystic kidney disease. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is a form of infantile cystic renal disease that manifests with the development of numerous small renal cysts that replace the normal renal parenchyma, resulting in end-stage kidney disease. It typically has a variable age of presentation during fetal life or childhood but can be a potential cause of oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia (Potter sequence) if it develops in utero."

The presentation varies depending on the age of onset, severity, and gender of the patient. In rare, mild cases, infertility may be the only presenting complaint when declared in adolescence or young adulthood. Most cases of CAH are diagnosed in childhood. Meconium ileus (Choice C) occurs when abnormally thick meconium occludes the intestine, resulting in a bowel obstruction. It is associated with cystic fibrosis. This patient has already passed meconium. Nephroblastoma (Wilms tumor) (Choice D) is the most common renal malignancy in childhood resulting from mutations in tumor suppressor genes WT1 or WT2. It is characterized by a large, often palpable, unilateral flank mass and hematuria. Testicular torsion (Choice F) occurs when the testicle rotates about itself within the scrotal sac. The twisting of the spermatic cord, which contains the gonadal artery, pampiniform plexus, and gonadal vein results in vascular congestion and potential cessation of venous or arterial flow.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The patient is most likely presenting with a malignant pleural effusion. His physical examination findings of jugular venous distention and edema of the face and upper extremities are suggestive of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, which is caused by obstruction of the SVC and venous congestion of the upper body and face. Obstruction of the SVC is often caused by extrinsic compression by a malignant mediastinal or pulmonary mass, which may be secondary to lung cancer, lymphoma, or metastatic disease from another primary source. Pleural effusions are clinically suspected on examination in the setting of dullness to percussion and diminished breath sounds, and can be visualized on imaging including chest x-ray, CT scan, or ultrasonography. Analyzing the pleural fluid can show an underlying cause to guide therapy. Fluid is inspected for cell counts, organisms, pH, enzyme activity, and serum glucose concentration and total protein concentrations. Low pH and low serum glucose are indicative of increased cellular metabolism in the fluid and may indicate underlying malignancy and/or infection. Malignant pleural effusions may have increased erythrocyte counts or appear grossly hemorrhagic as a result of tumor invasion and disruption of blood vessels and the visceral pleura. As well, Light criteria assesses whether the pleural effusion is likely to be exudative (eg, complex fluid resulting from pneumonia, empyema, malignancy, or inflammatory disease) or transudative (eg, serous fluid resulting from imbalanced hydrostatic or oncotic pressures) through evaluating the concentrations of pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase.",

        "A": "Congestive heart failure and nephrotic syndrome (Choice C) may be complicated by transudative pleural effusions caused by volume overload. Pleural effusions associated with volume overload are most likely bilateral as a result of the underlying systemic derangement, while exudative effusions related to malignancy or infection are more commonly unilateral. As well, transudative effusions do not demonstrate increased erythrocyte, lactate dehydrogenase, or protein concentrations. Traumatic hemothorax (Choice D) is an exudative effusion that contains increased erythrocyte concentrations and may appear frankly bloody on thoracentesis. It often occurs in the setting of rib fractures and/or pulmonary contusions. Malignant pleural effusion is more likely in the setting of a mediastinal mass on imaging. Tuberculous pleural effusion (Choice E) may be seen in endemic regions in the setting of chronic tuberculosis infection.

If severe, esophageal perforation can result leading to free air in the mediastinum. Treatment is initially focused on supportive measures including airway management and fluid resuscitation.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The most likely diagnosis in this otherwise healthy patient is transient synovitis of the hip. Transient synovitis is an inflammatory condition involving the synovial lining of weight-bearing joints, with the hip being commonly affected. It classically presents in children recovering from a viral infection with pain on weight-bearing, antalgic gait, refusal to ambulate, tenderness over the joint, and pain elicited with range of motion. Vital signs are generally within normal limits, as are laboratory studies with the exception of increased markers of inflammation such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Antecedent viral infection has been reported in up to 30% of cases of transient synovitis. Diagnosis involves the exclusion of emergent or urgent conditions such as cellulitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and fracture. Treatment is supportive, and involves rest plus nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, making oral ibuprofen the best choice for this patient. If there is diagnostic uncertainty, arthrocentesis to exclude septic arthritis, along with imaging to assess for osteomyelitis or fracture should be conducted.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Oral acyclovir is appropriate for cases of herpetic infections, such as herpes labial is, genital herpes, or varicella infections. Acyclovir is a guanosine analog that must first be activated by viral thymidine kinase, and ultimately prevents replication of the viral genome. It demonstrates no independent anti-inflammatory properties. Oral clindamycin (Choice B), an antibiotic that inhibits the 50S ribosomal subunit, is appropriate for treating cases of skin and soft-tissue infections, and exhibits broad activity against many gram-positive, gram negative, and anaerobic pathogens. Intravenous ceftriaxone (Choice D) and intravenous vancomycin (Choice E) are appropriate for the inpatient treatment of bacterial infections and are a common empiric regimen used to treat meningitis. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a common cause of migratory polyarthritis. Vancomycin inhibits the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, and therefore has the greatest activity against gram-positive organisms. It would be an appropriate choice to treat osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or skin and soft-tissue infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus."

Classically, it presents in an infant or young child with recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain often punctuated by asymptomatic periods. lntussusception typically occurs as a result of the presence of a pathologic lead point, often lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphadenopathy, Meckel diverticulum, stricture, or malignancy, which acts to draw one segment of bowel into an adjacent segment during peristalsis. If the intussusception self-resolves, there may be no symptoms. If it does not resolve, traction on mesenteric vessels can result in hypoperfusion of the segment with resultant inflammation, hemorrhage, obstruction, and pain. It may be detected on physical examination as an elongated mass, often in the right upper quadrant. Diagnosis consists of clinical history and physical examination and is supported by imaging. Ultrasonography evaluation is preferred in young children and will show telescoping interposed bowel segments in longitudinal orientation or a targetoid appearance in transverse orientation. Treatment of an ileocolic intussusception requires the administration of a contrast enema, which decreases the intussusception. Contrast enema is both diagnostic and therapeutic in this setting. Surgery may be required in cases where there is repetitive failure of the enema to decrease the intussusception or if the patient presents with symptoms concerning for bowel necrosis or perforation.",

Each congenital viral infection results in different congenital abnormalities. HSV can cause both cutaneous herpetic lesions and systemic manifestations like meningoencephalitis. Congenital infection with CMV manifests as hearing loss, seizures, a petechial rash, intracranial calcifications, organomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Neonates with congenital rubella infection exhibit a classic triad of cataracts, sensorineural deafness, and congenital heart disease. Exposure to alcohol in utero (Choice C) results in fetal alcohol syndrome, which can cause intellectual disability and congenital abnormalities such as microcephaly, facial abnormalities (eg, thin vermillion border, small palpebral fissures), and heart defects.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Puberty in boys typically follows a predictable course of gonadarche (enlargement of the testes), followed by pubarche (pubic hair), followed by adrenarche (axillary hair, facial hair, voice changes), followed by a growth spurt. This differs from the process in girls, which proceeds from thelarche (breast buds) to pubarche to growth spurt and finally menarche. In boys, delayed puberty is defined as the absence of testicular enlargement or secondary sexual characteristics at the age of 14 years. The most common cause of delayed puberty is constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), accounting for approximately 50% of cases, a normal variant. In CDGP, there is a transient defect in the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone with resultant delay in the stimulation of pituitary production of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. CDGP tends to be familial with many members of the same family undergoing late puberty compared with peers. In this case, the patient has undergone gonadarche (indicated by his Tanner stage 2 genital development) and pubarche but has not yet undergone adrenarche. Thus, while delayed, the sequence of his procession through the steps of puberty is appropriate and he can be reassured that his development will continue to progress.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Measurement of serum testosterone concentration is unnecessary in this case because the patient is progressing through the stages of puberty as expected. If his puberty did not continue to progress, testosterone measurement could be used to differentiate CDGP from another pathology. Mild bilateral gynecomastia can be normal in early puberty as a result of the small increase in extragonadal production of estrogen relative to the amount of testosterone being produced. Urine toxicology screening (Choice C) would be appropriate if there was a suspicion for drug use inducing gynecomastia, of which marijuana is the most common recreational drug. Breast biopsy (Choice E) would be indicated if the breast enlargement was caused by a nodule or mass rather than true gynecomastia. If delayed puberty were accompanied by neurologic findings or suspected to be caused by a process involving the brain such as a pituitary adenoma, MRI of the brain, not CT scan of the head (Choice D), would be indicated. Neither imaging modality is necessary in this case."

Patients present with signs and symptoms including tachycardia, tachypnea, fatigue, polyuria, shortness of breath, Kussmaul respiration, and diffuse abdominal discomfort. Laboratory evaluation typically shows increased concentrations of glucose, ketones, and a high anion-gap metabolic acidosis caused by the accumulation of unmeasured anions (ketones, lactic acid) in serum. Treatment is through the replacement of insulin, volume repletion, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions. Insulin is typically repleted at an initial dose of 0.1 U/kg/hour by intravenous infusion. Volume resuscitation with 0.9% saline is essential to restore intracellular fluid volume and lower the extracellular glucose concentration and is the initial step in the management of DKA even prior to insulin administration.

Infusing a fluid with potassium may result in worsening of unknown derangements with potentially life-threatening dysrhythmias. Administration of regular insulin either via intravenous dose at 0.1 U/h (Choice D) or via continuous intravenous infusion at 0.1 U/h (Choice E) is not the best next step because neither of these options are adjusted for the patient's weight. Insulin is typically repleted at an initial dose of 0.1 U/kg/h by intravenous infusion. Intravenous volume repletion with 0.9% saline is therefore a more appropriate initial step.

Physical examination may show bright red macules with a bluish-white center on the buccal mucosa (Koplik spots) and lymphadenopathy. Treatment is supportive. Vitamin A deficiency is associated with severe disease and complications, and supplementation should be provided, especially in children who are malnourished.

It is often triggered by an allergen (eg, smoke, pollen), exercise, or temperature change. It may be associated with progressive reactive airway remodeling over time. The lack of response to inhaled 13- adrenergic agonists and oral prednisone in this patient do not support the diagnosis of asthma. Congenital emphysema (Choice D) is a rare pulmonary disorder caused by disrupted embryonic bronchopulmonary development and is characterized by air trapping and lung hyperinflation, which can be visualized on chest imaging. The severity of disease varies widely and may be asymptomatic until adulthood or present in the newborn with respiratory distress. Cystic fibrosis (Choice E) is a clinical syndrome resulting from defects in the CFTR gene, leading to a deficiency in a chloride channel that secretes chloride in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract and reabsorbs chloride in sweat glands. Cystic fibrosis is associated with bronchiectasis because of the risk for recurrent pulmonary infections. The absence of other findings associated with cystic fibrosis, such as pancreatic insufficiency, diarrhea, malnutrition, and weight loss, argue against cystic fibrosis as the cause of this patient's bronchiectasis."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Neonatal jaundice is defined as an increased bilirubin concentration (greater than 5 mg/dl), which results from either increased hemolysis {bilirubin generation) or decreased bilirubin conjugation or excretion. Hyperbilirubinemia can be divided into direct and indirect forms in which either conjugated or unconjugated bilirubin accumulate, respectively. It can also be divided into physiologic and pathologic forms. Features of physiologic jaundice include development after 24 hours of life, a rate of bilirubin rise of less than 0.5 mg/dl daily, a maximum peak of 14 to 15 mg/dl, and a predominance of indirect bilirubin (greater than 90%). In contrast, jaundice within the first 24 hours of life {which rises faster than 0.5 mg/dl per hour), a predominance of direct bilirubin, and persistence beyond 2 weeks would suggest a pathologic cause. Newborn physiologic jaundice, also termed benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, occurs in nearly all newborns and is caused by the increased breakdown of red blood cells and thus generation of bilirubin, the immature liver metabolism of bilirubin, and the increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. These features taken together cause an indirect hyperbilirubinemia to develop. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is closely monitored in order to prevent kernicterus, which refers to the deposition of bilirubin in the basal ganglia, pons, and cerebellum. This can occur at bilirubin concentrations of 25 to 30 mg/dl. Treatment of the underlying cause of the jaundice and phototherapy for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia or exchange transfusion prevents this potentially fatal consequence. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, C, D, and F. ABO isoimmunization {Choice A) occurs when maternal lgG antibodies to fetal red blood cell antigens cause either fetal or neonatal destruction of these red blood cells. Bilirubin production is increased, and an indirect hyperbilirubinemia ensues. This cause of neonatal jaundice will present with pathologic findings such as an early presentation and rapid rate of rise, neither of which are present in this case. Biliary obstruction {Choice B) caused by biliary atresia is a common cause of direct hyperbilirubinemia. In congenital biliary atresia, the common bile duct is occluded or atretic and bile is unable to pass into the duodenum. Dehydration {Choice C) is the mechanism behind breastfeeding jaundice. In the first week of life, as a breastfeeding mother's milk begins to establish, the infant may become dehydrated. Dehydration leads to increased enterohepatic circulation and reabsorption of bilirubin, resulting in indirect hyperbilirubinemia. In this case, the infant's consistent wet diapers and stools argue against a dehydrated state.

A) ABO isoimmunization B) Biliary obstruction C) Dehydration D) Erythrocyte enzyme defect E) Physiologic jaundice F) Polycythemia Correct Answer: E. Neonatal jaundice is defined as an increased bilirubin concentration (greater than 5 mg/dl), which results from either increased hemolysis (bilirubin generation) or decreased bilirubin conjugation or excretion. Hyperbilirubinemia can be divided into direct and indirect forms in which either conjugated or unconjugated bilirubin accumulate, respectively. It can also be divided into physiologic and pathologic forms.

In this case, the infant's consistent wet diapers and stools argue against a dehydrated state. Erythrocyte enzyme defect (Choice D) such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency causes increased hemolysis of red blood cells and a subsequent increase in unconjugated bilirubin. This cause of neonatal jaundice would present with an early presentation and rapid rate of rise, along with a substantial decrease in the newborn's hematocrit. Polycythemia (Choice F) in a neonate is defined as a hematocrit concentration greater than 65%. This infant's hematocrit is well below this cutoff. Neonates with polycythemia can develop hyperbilirubinemia as a result of increased turnover of excess red blood cells. Educational Objective: Benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, or physiologic jaundice, is caused by the increased breakdown of red blood cells and thus generation of bilirubin, the immature liver metabolism of bilirubin, and the increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. Jaundice within the first 24 hours of life that rises faster than 0.5 mg/dl per hour and a predominance of direct bilirubin are features suggestive of a pathologic cause of hyperbilirubinemia. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 44 of 50 'I 44 . A 4-year-old girl is admitted to the hospital because of a 6-hour history of fever , decreased alertness , and a rash over her chest , arms , and legs. On admission , the patient is obtunded . Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 120/min , respirations are 30/min and shallow , and blood pressure is 70/30 mm Hg. Examination shows a purple macular rash over the trunk and extremities . The face and extremities are edematous . Fluid is administered by intravenous bolus , and intravenous administration of ceftriaxone and vancomycin is started . Fifteen minutes after admission , the patient becomes apneic . She is intubated , and mechanical ventilation is started . Serum studies show : Na • 135 mEq/L K+ 4 mEq/L HC0 15 mEq/L 3 Urea nitrogen 35 mg/dl Creatinine 0.8 mg/dl Her urine output is 1.5 mUkg/h . Arterial blood gas analysis on 40% oxygen shows : 7.2 35 mm Hg 100 mm Hg One hour later, her urine output decreases to less than 0.5 mUkg/h . A chest x-ray shows hazy lung fields bilaterally and cardiomegaly . Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Intravenous administration of an isotonic fluid bolus B) Intravenous administration of dopamine C) Intravenous administration of furosemide D) Intravenous administration of nitroprusside E) Increased inhaled oxygen concentration Correct Answer: B. A patient with fever, hypotension, edematous extremities, cardiomegaly, decreased urine output, and respiratory distress raises suspicion for myocarditis and cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock can occur when decreased cardiac output leads to organ hypoperfusion. In cardiogenic shock, dysfunction of cardiac myocytes results in decreased chronotropy, lusitropy, or inotropy. Decreased cardiac output and increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure result from such dysfunction. Systemic vascular resistance is increased as a physiologic attempt to maintain mean arterial pressure in the setting of decreased cardiac output and peripheral perfusion. Physical examination findings can include tachycardia, tachypnea, crackles on auscultation of the lungs, and an S or S gallop on cardiac auscultation. Dopamine is a vasopressor and 3 4 inotrope at increased doses. Intravenous administration of dopamine may be appropriate in cases of cardiogenic shock or refractory hypotension. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Intravenous administration of an isotonic fluid bolus (Choice A) is typically done initially in cases of distributive or hypovolemic shock. It would be harmful in a patient with cardiogenic shock because of impaired cardiac output and exacerbation of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and it was already empirically attempted in this case. Intravenous administration of furosemide (Choice C) would not be an initial step in the management of cardiogenic shock. Although total body fluid volume is increased (eg, pulmonary edema and extremity edema), cardiac output to the kidneys is decreased. Restoration of cardiac output and mean arterial pressure to prevent further damage to organs is the first priority. Intravenous administration of nitroprusside (Choice D) would be detrimental to this patient who is hypotensive. Nitroprusside is an intravenous, titratable vasodilator that can be used for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. It breaks down in circulation to release nitric oxide, which in turn activates guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscle to result in vascular smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Increased inhaled oxygen concentration (Choice E) would not be beneficial to this patient. Arterial blood gas analysis of this patient shows adequate partial pressure of oxygen. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 44 of 50 \" q K+ 4 mEq/L HCO 15 mEq/L 3 Urea nitrogen 35 mg/dl Creatinine 0.8 mg/dl Her urine output is 1.5 mUkg/h .

A 17-year-old boy comes to the physician because of swelling of his lower lip that has slowly resolved during the past 2 days . He has a 12-month history of intermittent asymmetric swelling of his face , chest , and arms . During three of the episodes , he also had abdominal pain and diarrhea . There is no history of travel outside the USA. He takes no medications . He does not use illicit drugs . He is not sexually active . Examination shows no abnormalities . Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis? A) Skin testing for environmental allergies B) Measurement of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity C) Measurement of serum C1 esterase inhibitor concentration D) Radioallergosorbent test (RAST) E) Serum protein electrophoresis Correct Answer: C. Hereditary angioedema presents with intermittent episodes of swelling of the skin, face, and lips, as well as the mucosal lining of the respiratory and gastrointestinal system. It is caused by an autosomal dominant inherited or de novo deficiency in C1 esterase inhibitor, which leads to overactivation of the complement system and overproduction of bradykinin. Bradykinin is a vasodilator that leads to the symptoms associated with hereditary angioedema. Episodes of angioedema can be caused by trauma, medications, and infections. They are not improved by antihistamines but commonly self-resolve. Further evaluation would also demonstrate a decreased C4 complement concentration in addition to the decreased concentration or activity of serum C1 esterase inhibitor.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Skin testing for environmental allergies may be useful in the evaluation of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis, which may also present with angioedema. However, anaphylaxis also causes wheezing as a result of laryngeal edema, urticaria, emesis, and hypotension. It is generally acute in onset following a specific exposure. Measurement of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity (Choice B) would not be useful in the evaluation of hereditary angioedema. However, decreased activity of ACE, as can be caused by ACE inhibitor medications, can lead to angioedema as a result of the decreased degradation of bradykinin. ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in hereditary angioedema. Radioallergosorbent test (RAST) (Choice D) is a test used to identify antibodies against particular antigens, although it is no longer commonly used. Because hereditary angioedema is not caused by an allergic reaction, a RAST would not be useful in its evaluation beyond ruling out an allergic contributor which is unlikely on the basis of no specific exposure history. Serum protein electrophoresis (Choice E) is commonly used to evaluate for malignancy (eg, multiple myeloma), as well as kidney and immunological disorders. It is not frequently used to evaluate the complement system and, thus, would have no role in diagnosing hereditary angioedema."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Kernicterus occurs as a result of the deposition of unconjugated bilirubin in a newborn's brain, usually in the basal ganglia, pons, and cerebellum. It typically presents with poor feeding, lethargy, and seizures. If untreated, it can cause long-term neurologic abnormalities, such as gaze palsies or sensorineural hearing loss. Unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is circulating insoluble bilirubin that is largely bound to albumin. It has not yet undergone conjugation in the liver. Causes of increased unconjugated bilirubin include hemolysis, breast milk jaundice, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, Gilbert syndrome, and physiologic jaundice. In newborns, causes also include maternal exposure to sulfonamide antibiotics, which displace bilirubin from albumin in the neonate, thereby increasing the free plasma concentrations of unconjugated bilirubin. Kernicterus typically occurs when the bilirubin concentration exceeds 25-30 mg/dL, which is commonly caused by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or Rh-hemolytic disease of the newborn, the latter of which was likely present in this patient given the discordant Rh status of him and his mother. Risk factors include prematurity, cephalohematoma or significant bruising, poor breastfeeding, and East Asian ethnicity. Treatment to prevent severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and subsequent kernicterus is phototherapy or exchange transfusion. Exchange transfusions are particularly useful in hyperbilirubinemia that is caused by anti-Rh(D) antibodies, as they allow removal of the antibodies as well as the bilirubin.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "feeding could be considered in breast milk jaundice or breastfeeding jaundice, although it is usually not required as the increased bilirubin concentrations seen are typically benign. Breast milk jaundice is hypothesized to occur because of the presence of beta-glucuronidase in breast milk, which deconjugates bilirubin and allows it to be reabsorbed. Breastfeeding jaundice occurs as a result of relative hypovolemia secondary to inadequate intake, which results in hyperbilirubinemia. Water supplementation (Choice B) is generally not advised in infants, as their kidneys are incapable of properly reabsorbing sodium, which results in hyponatremia. This can cause altered mental status and seizures. Water supplementation is not used to treat hyperbilirubinemia. Longer course of phototherapy (Choice C) could have decreased the overall amount of unconjugated bilirubin, as phototherapy converts indirect bilirubin into a water-soluble form that can be excreted. However, it would have been less effective in this patient with severe hyperbilirubinemia likely secondary to anti-Rh(D) antibody-mediated hemolysis. Antibiotic therapy (Choice D) is used in the treatment of neonatal infections, such as Escherichia coli or Streptococcus aga/actiae meningitis. Bacterial meningitis is associated with a high mortality if untreated, as well as prolonged neurologic complications, such as hearing loss, even when treated. A missed diagnosis of bacterial meningitis would have certainly led to neonatal demise or significant morbidity."

The disease has an autoimmune cause and is characterized by joint pain and inflammation. Patients commonly exhibit extra-articular manifestations such as uveitis, lymphadenopathy, and rash. There are a variety of sub-categories of JIA. For example, oligoarticular disease is characterized by the involvement of fewer than five joints (typically large joints such as the knee) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity; polyarticular disease is characterized by involvement of greater than five joints (typically both large and small joints such as the interphalangeal joints), uveitis, and negative ANA titers, and systemic disease (also known as juvenile onset Still disease) is characterized by variable joint involvement, rash, quotidian fever, and serositis. Diagnosis is often difficult and is based on a combination of characteristic clinical findings and suggestive laboratory tests, such as ANA, rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated peptide, and inflammatory tests such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate. There is no single, confirmatory laboratory test for JIA. Treatment modalities include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disease modifying antirheumatic medications such as methotrexate, and biologic agents.",

        "A": "Acute rheumatic fever is a late complication of under- or untreated Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) infection characterized by carditis, subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum, Sydenham chorea, and migratory polyarthritis. The cause is related to immune cross-reactivity as a result of molecular homology between streptococcal M protein and human cardiac myosin proteins. Septic arthritis (Choice C) is most commonly bacterial and presents with the rapid onset of fever, joint swelling, erythema, pain, tenderness with range of motion, inability to bear weight, and leukocytosis. Arthrocentesis typically shows bacteria on Gram stain, most often Gram-positive organisms, and leukocyte count is greater than or equal to 50,000/mm 3 with a neutrophilic predominance. Tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (Choice D) commonly presents as an acute injury in athletes when attempting rapid changes in direction upon a planted foot. Patients often report an audible pop when the injury is sustained and experience acute onset of pain, joint swelling, and instability. Tibia vara (Choice E) refers to an outward-bowing deformity of the tibia. It commonly occurs in children with vitamin D deficiency (rickets) or Blount disease. It does not typically manifest with joint swelling."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) typically occurs in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus as a result of increased insulin requirements during times of physiologic stress (eg, infection) or insulin nonadherence. DKA occurs as a result of the accumulation of serum ketones in the setting of deficient insulin signaling. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs because of the relative state of starvation created through absent insulin signaling. Patients may present with complaints of fatigue, polyuria, shortness of breath, and diffuse abdominal discomfort. Vital signs may show tachycardia and tachypnea. Laboratory studies typically show increased glucose and ketone concentrations, metabolic acidosis, and a high anion-gap caused by the accumulation of unmeasured anions in serum. In metabolic acidosis, excess hydrogen ions are transported into the cell in exchange for potassium ions to maintain electroneutrality. Insulin promotes intracellular potassium entry, and in DKA, insulin deficiency contributes to the excess cellular shift of potassium to the extracellular space resulting in hyperkalemia despite decreased concentrations of total body potassium as a result of excess urinary excretion. Treatment is through replacement of insulin, volume repletion, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Adrenal insufficiency (Choice A) refers to insufficient production of hormones from the adrenal cortex, which include aldosterone and cortisol; sex hormone deficiency may also be present. Primary adrenal insufficiency can present with deficiencies in both aldosterone and cortisol, whereas secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency tend to affect cortisol only. Insufficient aldosterone production leads to hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Insufficient cortisol can lead to hypoglycemia, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, and depressed mental status. In this patient, DKA is more likely given his history of type 1 diabetes, metabolic acidosis, and hyperglycemia. Excessive potassium intake (Choice C) would be unlikely to cause hyperkalemia in this patient. Kidney potassium filtration typically regulates serum potassium within a normal range, but this can be impaired in end stage kidney disease. In DKA, the kidney excretion of potassium is increased because of osmotic diuresis. Hyperkalemia in this case is as a result of the extracellular shift of potassium and deficient insulin signaling. Hemolysis (Choice D) can result in hyperkalemia because of the release of intracellular potassium into the serum. DKA is unlikely to cause hemolysis. Hemolytic anemia may present with jaundice and increased bilirubin. Respiratory acidosis (Choice E) would be the opposite of what is expected in a patient with DKA.

Pubertal gynecomastia is caused by a disruption in the normal balance of androgens and estrogens and is common in boys aged 12 to 14 years old, typically when they have a sexual maturity rating of 3, as in this patient. The increased concentrations of estrogen are caused by the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone to estrone and estradiol. On physical examination, gynecomastia may be tender to palpation. Results of laboratory studies will be within reference ranges in pubertal gynecomastia but could be used to delineate other causes of gynecomastia. These other causes include medications (eg, spironolactone, ketoconazole, antiandrogen therapy), liver cirrhosis, germ cell tumors, hypogonadism, and hyperthyroidism. Physiologic gynecomastia typically self-resolves but medical and surgical options exist for symptomatic patients, such as aromatase inhibitors and liposuction. As this patient has no signs to suggest pathologic gynecomastia, reassurance is appropriate.",

Neither present with gynecomastia as a direct result, though truncal obesity may resemble it in Cushing syndrome (or in Cushing disease). Measuring serum gonadotropin concentrations (Choice B) may be useful in the evaluation of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, such as Klinefelter syndrome, which can present with gynecomastia. However, patients with Klinefelter syndrome typically have testicular atrophy, tall stature, and long extremities, which this patient does not exhibit. Evaluating his brother for this finding (Choice C) may be useful if the gynecomastia was because of a hereditary disorder, such as partial androgen insensitivity or aromatase excess. However, this patient is presenting with mild gynecomastia associated with puberty, making physiologic gynecomastia more likely. Privately telling his parents about the finding (Choice D) is inappropriate, as the condition is benign, and the patient should be included in health conversations regarding his body."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Congenital melanocytic nevus (CMN) is a benign proliferation of melanocytes that is present from birth. Compared to normal skin, within a nevus the melanocytes are clustered into nests. Nests are either located in the basal layer of the epidermis, in the dermis, or both. Compared to acquired nevi, CMN are often larger and darker. CMN are classified by their size: small (<1.5 cm), medium (1.5-20 cm), large (>20-40 cm), and giant (>40 cm). Large and giant CMN are at risk for malignant transformation. In this case, the CMN is symmetrical, uniform in color and thickness, and appears to have a rough texture. Hair is present on the inferior aspect which is common in CMN. CMN should be routinely monitored by a dermatologist. If an area within the CMN develops increased thickness or change in color, it should be biopsied to evaluate for presence of melanoma. Provided the CMN does not develop melanoma, they are benign. However, they can be associated with psychological morbidity if they are located in cosmetically sensitive areas of the body and depending on their size. Complete surgical excision of large or giant CMN is usually impossible, but particularly bothersome areas may be excised to improve function and cosmesis.",

        "B": "Hyperpigmented macula describe cafe-au-lait spots. A cafe-au-lait spot is characterized by a tan to dark brown, uniformly pigmented macule or patch often seen at birth or noticed in early childhood. This lesion, in contrast, is a dark brown plaque with the presence of hair at the inferior aspect. It may be asymmetrical or have an irregular border. It represents a focal increase in melanin production rather than an increased number of melanocytes or any form of malignancy. While numerous cafe-au-lait spots suggest an underlying genetic disease, a single lesion is a normal finding. Macular stain (Choice C), port-wine stain (Choice D), and superficial hemangioma (Choice E) are all vascular lesions and will appear red to purple rather than brown to black. Macular stains, or nevi flammeus, are common red patches present on the forehead and posterior neck at birth. Port-wine stain and nevus flammeus are both capillary malformations while superficial hemangioma is a benign proliferation of capillary sized vessels. These lesions are benign, but superficial hemangiomas may ulcerate and bleed. Both port-wine stains and superficial hemangiomas can be treated with laser therapy to decrease the size and color if desired. Nevus flammeus on the forehead and eyelids commonly resolves and those on the posterior neck usually fade but do not completely disappear."

The diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is made based on clinical symptoms. Pruritus must be present in addition to three of the following: current or past flexural eczema, history of asthma or hay fever, or presence of dry skin within the past year. The rash is initially characterized by erythematous papules and vesicles with exudates and crusting. With chronic scratching, they become dry, scaly, and excoriated in a process called lichenification. This patient's flexural dermatitis and apparent asthma and hay fever suggest a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis. Treatment of atopic dermatitis begins with gentle skin care: minimizing long baths in warm water which causes drying of the skin, avoiding products with fragrance, and use of bland moisturizers such as petroleum jelly daily. Flares of eczema are treated with mild to moderate potency topical corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone. In children, a moderate potency topical corticosteroid should not be used consistently for over 2 to 3 weeks because of the potential of systemic absorption.",

Coal tar (Choice B) is a topical remedy used in psoriasis, not eczema. Its mechanism is not fully elucidated, but it is thought to be anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative to the epidermis.",
        "D": "Lindane is an antiparasitic agent which in the past has been used to treat lice infestation. However, it is no longer used given the relatively high incidence of neurologic toxicity. This is especially of concern in young children, who have a lower body surface area to volume ratio."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "lgA deficiency is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms. Selective lgA deficiency describes a decreased or absent concentration of circulating lgA with normal concentrations of lgG, and normal or increased concentrations of lgM. lgA is critical for immune health and functions in two primary ways. First, lgA binds pathogen surface antigens targeting them for opsonization, complement activation, and phagocytosis. Second, lgA coats mucosal surfaces and prevents colonization, adhesion, and invasion by pathogenic microorganisms. lmmunoglobulins are produced by plasma cells, which are terminally differentiated B lymphocytes; as a result, most causal deficiencies are hypothesized to be related to B lymphocyte abnormalities. Despite this, there is clinical heterogeneity in the severity of lgA deficiency. Some patients remain asymptomatic while others suffer from recurrent sinopulmonary infections or otitis media, as is the case for this patient. In younger patients with severe deficiency, failure to thrive is common. Anaphylactic reactions to blood products such as plasma (which contain donor immunoglobulin) are classic but uncommon, as not all patients with lgA deficiency have reactions to blood products. Such severe reactions are most common in patients with undetectable concentrations of lgA; these reactions occur because of the presence of preformed antibodies against lgA, which is a non-native protein in these patients, and thus, a target of immune activation.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Impaired chemotaxis describes several syndromes, one of which is hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome. These patients have abnormal Th T-lymphocyte function and thus, impaired release of IL-17, a 17 potent agent for neutrophil chemotaxis. These patients present with recurrent abscesses with minimal inflammation. Impaired respiratory burst (Choice C) describes chronic granulomatous disease, which is caused by a deficiency in NADPH oxidase, an enzyme used to generate hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid. These molecules are typically used to kill bacteria intracellularly. Patients present with recurrent pyogenic infections with catalase-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, with normal concentrations of leukocytes and immunoglobulins. Splenic dysfunction (Choice D) can be the consequence of splenectomy or can occur in diseases such as sickle cell disease, where patients become functionally asplenic early in the course of disease. This predisposes to infection with encapsulated organisms such as Haemophi/us influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. lgA deficiency is the more likely diagnosis for this patient. T-lymphocyte dysfunction (Choice E) describes numerous disorders affecting either T-lymphocyte maturation, survival, or function. Conditions such as severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCIO) or Di George syndrome result in a near absence of T lymphocytes with recurrent viral and fungal infections. T lymphocytes also play a role in augmenting B-lymphocyte activation, so deficiency or dysfunction can impair humoral immunity. These patients present with severe and recurrent invasive infections early in life."

There are four a-globin alleles and two ~-globin alleles. Mutations in one or two a-globin alleles or one ~-globin allele causes thalassemia minor. Thalassemia trait is common in Southeast Asia and presents with mild microcytic anemia. Features include the presence of target cells on peripheral blood smear (pictured in the photomicrograph above), a low RDW (which indicates that most erythrocytes are of the same size with little variation), and persistence of microcytosis. Iron concentrations can be measured to rule out iron deficiency. Other cell lines including platelets and white blood cells should be within normal ranges.

Nephritic syndromes typically present with acute kidney injury with associated hematuria, red blood cell casts, and hypertension. On urinalysis, there will be a significant quantity of red blood cells (RBCs), possible RBC casts, and sub-nephrotic range proteinuria. Serum complement concentrations, including C3, are typically within reference ranges. This differentiates lgA nephropathy from postinfectious glomerulonephritis, which results in decreased serum C3 complement. Additionally, anti-streptolysin O and anti-DNase titers will be negative in lgA nephropathy. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Hemolytic uremic syndrome {Choice A) is caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (O157:H?) and is usually accompanied by bloody diarrhea. This is characterized by a classic triad of thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Hemorrhagic cystitis {Choice B) refers to inflammation of the urinary bladder, which commonly is secondary to an acute bacterial urinary tract infection presenting with dysuria, urinary urgency, and frequency. A typical infectious cystitis presents with increased urinary white blood cells with detectable leukocyte esterase and nitrites on urinalysis, depending on the infectious organism. In hemorrhagic cystitis, red blood cells are also present on urinalysis. Nephrotic syndrome {Choice D) typically presents with excessive proteinuria (>3 g/day) hyperlipidemia, hypoalbuminemia, and peripheral edema. It does not cause hematuria. The most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is minimal change disease. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis {Choice E) is a nephritic syndrome presenting with urinary RBCs and RBC casts, which typically occurs between 2 and 6 weeks after infection with group A ~-hemolytic streptococci.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient with cystic fibrosis is likely presenting with findings of volume overload in cor pulmonale. Patients with cystic fibrosis may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and fibrotic remodeling in chronically hypoventilated and inflamed pulmonary parenchyma leading to increased vascular resistance. If severe, this process can lead to cor pulmonale, which refers to isolated right heart failure secondary to chronic pulmonary pathology with increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right-sided heart pressures. Right heart failure typically presents with venous congestion, seen as jugular venous distention, peripheral edema, and hepatomegaly with or without ascites.",

        "A": "Cirrhosis of the liver occurs secondary to many causes, the most common being alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis presents with ascites, anasarca, jaundice, increased transaminases, low albumin concentration, and impaired hepatic synthetic function. While right heart failure may cause cirrhosis, this patient only has some consistent findings. Inferior vena cava obstruction (Choice C) causes the obstruction of venous drainage from the lower regions of the body, often related to an underlying malignancy and associated mass effect, thrombosis from an indwelling catheter, or as a result of compression by a gravid uterus. This patient lacks a history suggestive of any likely cause of inferior vena cava obstruction.",
        "D": "Lymphedema refers to swelling secondary to abnormal lymphatic drainage of a region, often secondary to surgery, radiation, or invasive parasitic disease. This patient lacks the appropriate history for these causes. Nephrotic syndrome (Choice E) results from many causes and typically presents with proteinuria, edema, hyperlipidemia, and a hypercoagulable state. Cystic fibrosis does not commonly cause nephrotic syndrome. Protein-losing enteropathy (Choice F) refers to any gastrointestinal pathology that results in the loss of protein, which may present with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and peripheral edema. Potential causes include inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and amyloidosis. Cystic fibrosis may cause steatorrhea. Vitamin E deficiency (Choice G) presents with hemolytic anemia and generalized muscle weakness. It can have a similar presentation to vitamin B (cobalamin) deficiency with posterior column and spinocerebellar 12 tract demyelination."

A 2-month -old infant has a large posterior fontanelle , a large tongue , and hypotonia. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation; pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. Apgar scores were 7 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes , respectively . Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of disease? A) Anterior horn cell degeneration B) Connective tissue disorder C) Cortical dysfunction D) Electrolyte imbalance E) Myopathy F) Peripheral neuropathy G) Spinal cord dysfunction H) Thyroid dysfunction CorrectAnswer: H. Congenital thyroid dysfunction that leads to hypothyroidism is typically asymptomatic at birth. This is because maternal thyroid hormone is able to cross the placenta, which keeps the newborn in a euthyroid state. Congenital hypothyroidism commonly presents in the first few months of life with feeding difficulties, lethargy, constipation, myxedematous facies, macroglossia, large fontanelles, hypotonia, and hypothermia. Infants with this disorder may also present with goiter, or congenital cardiac, kidney, or gastrointestinal malformations. Thyroid dysfunction can be caused by a variety of mechanisms, including thyroid dysgenesis, resistance to thyroid-stimulating hormone, abnormalities in thyroid hormone transport, iodine deficiency, maternal antibodies, or antithyroid medications. Congenital hypothyroidism is now typically identified on routine newborn screening. It is treated with thyroid hormone supplementation (eg, levothyroxine) but can lead to intellectual disability or neurologic issues (eg, hearing loss, ataxia) if untreated. Incorrect Answers: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Anterior horn cell degeneration (Choice A) is seen in spinal muscular atrophy, which presents with hypotonia and weakness in the newborn. It can also present with a weak cry, difficulty feeding, and respiratory failure, which are not seen in this patient. Connective tissue disorders (Choice B) include Ehlers-Danlos and Marfan syndrome. These are not typically apparent at birth, rather manifesting later as hyperflexiblity and skin elasticity (Ehlers-Danlos) or tall stature with long extremities and fingers (Marfan syndrome). They are not associated with macroglossia or a large posterior fontanelle. Cortical dysfunction (Choice C) can occur secondary to cerebral palsy, intracranial hemorrhage, or a variety of other neurologic conditions. It would be expected to present more broadly with intellectual disability or developmental delay, as well neuromuscular abnormalities such as unilateral weakness or spastic paralysis. Electrolyte imbalances (Choice D) can lead to cardiac irritability (potassium, magnesium, calcium), skeletal abnormalities (calcium), altered mental status or neurologic abnormalities (sodium, calcium), and neuromuscular weakness (potassium, magnesium). Changes in electrolyte concentrations would not be expected to present with a large posterior fontanelle and tongue. Myopathy (Choice E) generally presents with muscle weakness, rather than hypotonia, although the latter can also be present. If present at 2 months of age, the diagnosis would likely be congenital myopathy. Depending on the subtype, congenital myopathies can present with a variety of symptoms and anatomic abnormalities, such as respiratory failure or scoliosis, although these do not include a large posterior fontanelle or macroglossia. Peripheral neuropathy (Choice F) commonly presents with paresthesias, numbness, or weakness in the extremities, and it can be caused by congenital disorders, diabetes mellitus, injury, or infection. It would not be expected to present with a large posterior fontanelle and tongue. Spinal cord dysfunction (Choice G) could present with weakness, numbness, paresthesias, or autonomic instability. However, it would be unlikely to cause anatomic changes superior to the area of dysfunction. Educational Objective: Congenital hypothyroidism presents in the first few months of life with feeding difficulties, lethargy, constipation, myxedematous facies, macroglossia, large fontanelles, hypotonia, and hypothermia. r \" , r-- r ,",

PSGN typically occurs between 2 and 4 weeks following an acute infection with Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) (typically impetigo, streptococcal pharyngitis, or tonsillitis). Appropriate treatment of the streptococcal infection with antibiotics does not reduce the likelihood of subsequently developing PSGN. PSGN is caused by a type Ill hypersensitivity reaction with the kidney deposition of immune complexes and complement. Patients typically present with dark colored urine, hypertension, and peripheral and periorbital edema. Urinalysis typically shows red blood cell casts. The diagnosis is confirmed with kidney biopsy, which shows enlarged glomeruli on light microscopy, bumpy irregularity of the glomerular basement membrane on immunofluorescence, and subepithelial immune complex deposits on electron microscopy.

It causes two diseases: varicella and herpes zoster. Varicella causes chickenpox in immunocompetent children which is characterized by a pruritic, asynchronous rash with fluid-filled vesicles that crust. The vesicles heal as crusted papules and lesions are in various stages of healing. Varicella can cause encephalitis and pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients, such as an individual being treated with chemotherapy. Herpes zoster is caused by the recurrence of VZV after it has been reactivated from its dormancy in the dorsal root ganglion of a spinal nerve. It commonly presents as a unilateral, dermatomal erythematous patch with overlying clear to yellow, grouped vesicles. It can be associated with neuropathic pain which can precede and outlast the rash. However, post-herpetic neuralgia is more common in elderly patients than pediatric patients.

Methemoglobin cannot effectively bind oxygen, which impairs tissue oxygen delivery. •) Most cases of methemoglobinemia are acquired, typically via exposure to an oxidant stressor such as an anesthetic (eg, benzocaine), nitrate, or dapsone. Symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, lethargy, lightheadedness, and in severe cases, arrhythmia, seizure, and multisystem organ failure. Vital signs typically show reduced oxygen saturation, and examination may disclose cyanosis. Characteristically, blood appears darkened on gross visualization, although hemoglobin concentration and erythrocyte morphology are normal. Treatment includes supplemental oxygen plus the intravenous administration of methylene blue, a reducing agent that donates electrons to heme. The reduction of heme iron to the ferrous (Fe 2 form restores the ability of hemoglobin to bind, carry, and deliver oxygen to tissues. •) lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, E, and F. Administration of atropine (Choice A) would be indicated in cases of symptomatic bradycardia or organophosphate poisoning. This patient's pulse is tachycardic and atropine administration would be inappropriate. Administration of deferoxamine (Choice B) is indicated in the treatment of hemochromatosis or iron toxicity. It is a therapy that binds free iron in the serum and promotes elimination in the urine. Administration of naloxone (Choice D) is indicated in cases of opioid overdose. Opioid overdoses are characterized by respiratory depression presenting as a decreased respiratory rate, apnea, and hypoxia. This patient's hypoxia is caused by methemoglobinemia, not respiratory depression. Administration of pyridostigmine (Choice E) is used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. It is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases the concentration of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (Choice F) can be helpful in the treatment of decompression sickness and carbon monoxide poisoning.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Observation of proper hand-washing techniques is the most effective strategy to limit the spread of nosocomial enteric viral pathogens. Viral shedding in the stool can occur prior to the development of symptoms and potentially allow asymptomatic patients to become vectors for disease. Additionally, viral shedding in the stool persists until after the resolution of symptoms. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not as efficacious at removing enteric viruses from the hands or other commonly touched surfaces, although cleaning agents that utilize bleach are effective. It is likely that the 10-day-old newborn acquired rotavirus infection after caregivers came in contact with a surface contaminated by feces from the 2-month-old infant and then touched the younger child without washing their hands properly. Spread of enteric viruses can be reduced by simply by performing routine hand washing, which typically involves rubbing the hands together with soap for at least twenty seconds. Individuals often neglect to scrub the entire surface of the hand despite an adequate duration of hand washing.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Disposing of diapers and other waste items properly is also important, as rotavirus is shed in the stool, but adherence to these measures tends to be higher amongst caregivers than the simple observance of hand washing. It is unlikely that the patient acquired infection directly through contact with the other patient's diapers; caregivers more likely touched other contaminated surfaces. Observing gown and glove precautions (Choice B) is an important part of preventing the spread of certain bacteria and viruses, and contact precautions are often instituted in instances of viral gastroenteritis. However, proper hand washing should always occur before and after donning and doffing gown and gloves. Placing the patient in a reverse airflow room (Choice D) would have little effect on the transmission of rotavirus as this pathogen is not transmitted by aerosolized particles. Negative pressure rooms are more commonly reserved for airborne pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and measles, among others. Restricting visitors to the room (Choice E) decreases the number of individuals who can potentially act as vectors to transfer rotavirus between the patients, but observing proper hand washing is more likely to reduce the spread of infection regardless of the number of visitors."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient with generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, diarrhea, and hepatosplenomegaly with leukopenia most likely has acute HIV infection, known as acute retroviral syndrome. The presentation of primary HIV infection can vary significantly between patients, with some experiencing a mild febrile illness while others experience a severe, mononucleosis-like viral syndrome. The time between infection and onset of symptoms is variable, with incubation time lasting several weeks to months. During acute infection, there is a high degree of viral replication followed by widespread infection of CD4+ T lymphocytes. While the T lymphocyte count may decrease transiently, it is often within reference ranges in early HIV infection unless patients present with signs of opportunistic infection. Initial laboratory studies include the use of a fourth generation HIV test, which tests for HIV p24 antigen and antibodies, combined with direct measurement of the HIV viral load using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. It is common in early infection for patients to have a negative fourth generation test but a high viral load; this is known as the window period. Once the diagnosis is made, laboratory studies should be sent for mutational analysis and genotyping, but this should not delay immediate treatment with antiretroviral therapy. Therapy typically includes a combination of at least three different medications from at least two different antiretroviral classes. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, E, and F. Common variable immunodeficiency (Choice A) classically presents between the ages of 20 to 40 years as multiple, recurrent sinus or pulmonary infections, including pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinusitis.

Selective lgA deficiency (Choice C) describes an absence of lgA with normal concentrations of lgG, and normal or increased concentrations of lgM. Many patients are asymptomatic and do not demonstrate a history of recurrent infections. The classic presentation is anaphylaxis after transfusion of blood products, which occurs as the result of pre-formed anti-lgA antibodies. Severe combined immunodeficiency (Choice D) results from a variety of different mutations and commonly presents with recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections as a result of severe impairment in both B and T-lymphocyte function in infancy.

This patient's age and absence of prior recurrent infections essentially rules out this diagnosis. Thymic-parathyroid dysplasia (DiGeorge syndrome) (Choice E) is caused by a 22q11 deletion that leads to failure of the third and fourth branchial pouches to develop. These structures give rise to the thymus and parathyroid glands, and their absence leads to thymic aplasia and hypocalcemia in cardiac and craniofacial defects. Patients are susceptible to viral and fungal infections. The definitive diagnosis requires fluorescence in-situ hybridization to detect the missing DNA segment. X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Choice F) occurs as a result of mutations in the BTK gene that encodes a tyrosine kinase essential for all stages of B lymphocyte development and proliferation. Patients lack functioning B lymphocytes and therefore lack normal concentrations of immunoglobulins. This patient exhibits normal concentrations of all immunoglobulins. Educational Objective: Acute retroviral syndrome, or acute HIV infection, commonly presents with diffuse lymphadenopathy, diarrhea, malaise, fever, and weight loss.

Human placental lactogen produced by the placenta increases maternal insulin resistance. This leads to increased concentrations of glucose in the maternal circulation, and subsequently the fetal circulation. Fetal hyperglycemia in turn causes the fetus to produce excess insulin, with a consequent decrease in the rate of gluconeogenesis. The insulin then acts as a growth factor, leading to macrosomia, and inhibits the production of surfactant, which leads to respiratory distress syndrome. After birth, the fetus continues to synthesize insulin but is no longer exposed to maternal blood glucose concentrations, leading to hypoglycemia.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus does not commonly present in the newborn; it more commonly presents in children with polyuria, polydipsia, or diabetic ketoacidosis. Increased glucagon secretion (Choice C) would cause neonatal hyperglycemia, as its main mechanism of action is to increase plasma glucose. Eventually, glucagon secretion will increase, and insulin secretion will decrease, which will return the blood glucose concentrations to normal reference ranges. Increased gluconeogenesis (Choice D) would increase the plasma glucose concentration and would occur with increased glucagon. This patient is presenting with hypoglycemia as a result of excessive insulin secretion. Insulin resistance (Choice F) would present with hyperglycemia and is seen in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Neonatal hypothermia requires prompt correction as it is associated with increased mortality. Hypothermia increases oxygen consumption and metabolic demands on the neonate which leads to less successful resuscitation efforts if they are needed.

Neurocysticercosis (Choice D) is an infection caused by the parasitic pork tapeworm Taenia solium that occurs most commonly in endemic rural regions of Latin America, Asia, and Africa. It can present with findings similar to bacterial meningitis, as well as muscle or subcutaneous nodules. A CT scan will show cystic, ring-enhancing, calcified lesions in the brain parenchyma, meninges, ventricles, spinal cord, and/or orbit. Tuberculous meningitis (Choice F) typically presents in a more subacute fashion than bacterial meningitis and is more frequently associated with cranial nerve palsies. In children, seizures are common. CSF evaluation will show a predominance of lymphocytes, unlike in this patient. Educational Objective: Bacterial meningitis presents acutely with fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation is the initial diagnostic step and will show an increased opening pressure, increased leukocyte count with prominent neutrophils, increased protein concentration, and decreased serum glucose concentration.

An 8-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of fever , progressive cough , and sputum production . Examination at birth showed no abnormalities , but she has a history of respiratory problems since infancy. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 100/min , and respirations are 32/min . Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 84%. Examination shows clubbing , circumoral cyanosis , and a hyperexpanded chest. There are diffuse rhonchi bilaterally with end-expiratory wheezing . An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation , scattered atelectasis , and chronic interstitial changes . CorrectAnswer: D. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the CFTR gene, leading to a deficiency in a chloride channel that secretes chloride in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract and reabsorbs chloride in sweat glands. This abnormal chloride transport causes decreased chloride and water secretion and increased water reabsorption, leading to abnormally viscous mucous. The thick mucus in the gastrointestinal tract contributes to pancreatic insufficiency, steatorrhea, and malabsorption, leading to a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. In the lungs, the disease manifests as recurrent pneumonia, especially with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Repeat antibiotic exposure increases the risk for colonization with resistant organisms. Obstruction and destruction of the airways leads to hypoxemia, air trapping, and bronchiectasis. Physical examination may disclose hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (clubbing), cyanosis, rales and rhonchi, and hyperresonance to percussion of the chest. X-ray findings include hyperinflation, bronchiectasis with peribronchial cuffing, and diffuse nonspecific inflammatory changes.",

A 2-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of episodes of turning blue while playing over the past 6 months ; the episodes have been increasing in frequency over the past month and occur most often when she is\nagitated . She was born at term and weighed 3317 g (7 lb 5 oz). She has a normal diet for her age . She is at the 25th percentile for height and weight. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F) , pulse is 100/min , respirations are\n26/min , and blood pressure is 80/46 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 87% . The lungs are clear to auscultation . There is a heave at the left sternal border . A grade 3/6, harsh systolic murmur is\nheard at the left sternal border with radiation to the axilla . An x-ray of the chest shows decreased pulmonary vascularity and a prominent right ventricle .\nCorrect Answer: C.\nCongenital heart disease refers to a spectrum of disorders caused by structural deformities of the heart and great vessels during embryonic development. These disorders are often subdivided into cyanotic and non-cyanotic\ntypes depending on the direction of blood shunting. Structural heart defects that result in flow of deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary to systemic circulations (a right-to-left shunt) classically present with cyanosis,\nrespiratory distress, hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension generally within a few days of birth. Common culprit lesions include truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great vessels, tricuspid atresia, tetralogy of\nFallo!, and total anomalous pulmonary venous return. Left-to-right shunting occurs with ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, and patent ductus arteriosus. The chronic additional influx of blood into the pulmonary\ncirculation can result in pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy over time with reversal of the shunt to right-to-left (Eisenmenger syndrome). Patients typically present with dyspnea on exertion and cyanosis .\nIncorrect Answers: A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K.\nAsthma (Choice A) is characterized by reversible obstruction to airflow caused by the spasm of smooth muscle in the small airways. It is often triggered by an allergen (eg, smoke, pollen), exercise, or temperature change.\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia (Choice B) is a neonatal lung disorder associated with oxygen exposure and mechanical ventilation in preterm infants. The lungs fail to mature properly, and patients develop chronic lung disease\ncharacterized by decreased lung volumes, hyperinflation, and atelectasis.\nCystic fibrosis (Choice D) can result in cyanosis as a result of chronic lung infections with obstruction and chronic inflammatory changes to the lung parenchyma. Patients typically present with recurrent pneumonia and\ngastrointestinal symptoms.\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Choice E) is a congenital heart condition characterized by myocardial thickening and left outflow tract obstruction. Patients typically present with a murmur and may develop diastolic dysfunction .\nIdiopathic pulmonary hypertension (Choice F) is a rare pulmonary disorder with an unknown cause characterized by progressive pulmonary vascular hypertension. Persistent pulmonary hypertension (Choice I) with any cause\nmay result in right heart failure. Patients typically present with exertional dyspnea and physical examination findings suggestive of right heart failure.\nMethemoglobinemia (Choice G) is the accumulation of hemoglobin with an oxidized iron atom that is unable to transport oxygen, resulting in hypoxia. Infants are more susceptible than adults. It is associated with exposure to\nan oxidizing agent.\nPatent foramen ovale (Choice H) is a common form of atrial septal defect that is typically asymptomatic but can result in a left-to-right shunt and potential for systemic embolization of venous thromboses. Physical examination\nmay disclose wide, fixed splitting of the S heart sound.\n2\nPneumococcal pneumonia (Choice J) is a common infection of the lung parenchyma. Acute infection presents with fever, cough, increased sputum production, and consolidation on chest imaging.\nr \" , r-- r ,\n\n      \nExam Section : Item 22 of 50",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Anaphylactic shock, a severe type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, presents following exposure to an allergen. It is caused by widespread lgE-mediated mast cell degranulation and is characterized by histaminergic responses within multiple organ systems leading to flushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and vasodilation, which can lead to airway obstruction and circulatory collapse. If not managed promptly, death can occur from hypoxia or distributive shock. Anaphylaxis is a form of distributive shock, which is characterized by a primary reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). This reduction in SVR is secondary to lgE-mediated histamine and cytokine release. Cardiac output increases to compensate for low SVR in the early stages of distributive shock. If the inciting state is not appropriately treated, further decompensation can occur, resulting in progressive hypotension and insufficient perfusion with associated end-organ damage. After the administration of epinephrine, fluid resuscitation should be initiated to increase intravascular volume to support adequate organ perfusion.",

Causative organisms in the pediatric population depend on the age of the patient. In the neonatal period, patients are at risk for infection from microbes present in the vaginal canal including Streptococcus agalactiae (group B), Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. In patients between the ages of 2 and 5 years, viral pneumonia is most common. Bacterial pathogens include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Staphylococcus aureus. The risk for H. influenzae type b infection is reduced in patients with up-to-date immunizations. Staphylococcus aureus commonly expresses beta-lactamases, which confer resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics such as amoxicillin, and combination therapy with a beta-lactam or a beta-lactamase inhibitor (eg, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) is recommended.

Acute osteomyelitis is more common in children and is most often caused by infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Risk factors include traumatic inoculating injury, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, intravenous substance use, and prosthetic devices or indwelling hardware. Patients typically complain of pain, difficulty bearing weight, and overlying erythema. Laboratory studies may show leukocytosis and increased inflammatory markers. Imaging typically shows localized osseous erosive changes. Bone scintigraphy with the radiotracer technetium 99m may show increased uptake in the area of infection.",

        "B": "Schlatter disease refers to osteochondrosis or traction apophysitis of the tibial tubercle that typically occurs in adolescent, athletic children . This presents with progressive pain along the anterior aspect of the proximal tibia and knee that is exacerbated by kneeling. Physical examination typically discloses tenderness over an enlarged tibial tubercle. Patients do not present with inability to bear weight or fever. Fracture of the tibia (Choice C) presents with acute pain, inability to bear weight on the extremity, and localized edema and tenderness in the area of injury. Fever, leukocytosis, and increased inflammatory markers would be unusual. Bone scintigraphy may be useful for detecting occult fractures, but x-ray or CT scan would be the initial modality of choice. Prepatellar bursitis (Choice D) refers to inflammation of the bursa overlying the patella. Common causes include infection, trauma, and recurrent pressure (as from occupations that require frequent kneeling). A bone scan would show no abnormalities. Septic arthritis (Choice E) results from bacterial infection of the synovial joint space, most commonly by S. aureus. The affected joint demonstrates pain, swelling, and erythema. Arthrocentesis is indicated for the evaluation of monoarticular erythema and swelling to evaluate for septic arthritis, which characteristically shows purulent synovial fluid with >50,000 WBC/mm 3 Physical examination would disclose a tender, • erythematous, and edematous joint, which is not present in this case."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Galactosemia is the most likely diagnosis in this exclusively breast-fed patient with hepatomegaly and the presence of reducing substances in the urine. Normal metabolism of lactose involves separation into glucose and galactose by lactase. Free glucose can be used for cellular energy production while galactose must be converted to galactose-1-phosphate by galactokinase and then subsequently converted to UDP-galactose and then glucose-1-phosphate by galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT). While galactosemia can result from deficiencies in several different enzymes in this pathway, deficiency of GALT causes classic galactosemia, which is an autosomal recessive disorder. Breast milk contains galactose, which patients with galactosemia are unable to break down. Early complications include jaundice, vomiting, hepatomegaly, diarrhea, lethargy, and occasionally sepsis with Gram-negative organisms. Coagulopathy and easy bruising may also occur. Diagnosis is made by assessing for the presence and activity of GALT in erythrocytes by radioimmunoassay. Reducing substances are molecules that can convert cupric to cuprous ions in the urine and include glucose, lactose, pentose, and galactose. The presence of these substances (galactose) can suggest the diagnosis but is not specific. Additionally, while galactosemia is detected on newborn screening, manifestations of the disease can occur before the results of screening are available. Treatment requires eliminating dietary galactose and providing necessary supplements, however, this may not reverse neurologic sequelae of the disease, such as infantile cataracts and intellectual disability.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Hereditary fructose intolerance is caused by a deficiency in aldolase B, an enzyme important in the metabolism of fructose. Deficiency results in increased concentrations offructose-1-phosphate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, causing a deficiency of available phosphate, which inhibits gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Patients present with hypoglycemia only after fructose is introduced into the diet. Mucopolysaccharidosis II (Choice C), also known as Hunter syndrome, is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in iduronate-2-sulfatase, which results in the deposition of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Within the first year of life, patients develop coarse facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, hernias, and dysostosis multiplex. Type I glycogen storage disease (Choice D) is caused by glucose 6-phosphatase deficiency. This enzyme is located in the liver and functions in gluconeogenesis to convert glucose-6-phosphate to glucose for its release into the blood. Impaired gluconeogenesis can lead to severe hypoglycemia during periods of fasting. It is characterized by excess glycogen in the liver, hepatomegaly, and fasting hypoglycemia.",
        "E": "Tyrosinemia can refer to one of several disorders in which enzymes required for the metabolism of tyrosine are deficient.

It causes two diseases: varicella and herpes zoster. Varicella causes chickenpox in immunocompetent children which is characterized by a pruritic, asynchronous rash with fluid-filled vesicles that crust. The vesicles heal as crusted papules and lesions are in various stages of healing. Varicella can cause encephalitis and pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients, such as an individual being treated with chemotherapy. Herpes zoster is caused by the recurrence of VZV after it has been reactivated from its dormancy in the dorsal root ganglion of a spinal nerve. It commonly presents as a unilateral, dermatomal erythematous patch with overlying clear to yellow, grouped vesicles. It can be associated with neuropathic pain which can precede and outlast the rash. However, post-herpetic neuralgia is more common in elderly patients than pediatric patients.

SVT is often idiopathic and paroxysmal but may occur secondary to accessory pathways in some children with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Diagnosis is made by ECG, although some children may require cardiac monitoring in order to capture a paroxysmal event. AV nodal blockade with adenosine is the first line treatment for narrow complex SVT. Adenosine is a purine analogue that acts on the adenosine receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor that signals through adenylate cyclase. In the AV node, binding of the adenosine Arreceptor leads to cellular hyperpolarization and reduced transmission of supraventricular action potentials. If adenosine fails, synchronized cardioversion may be attempted. Children who are old enough may be trained to use vagal maneuvers in order to naturally induce AV nodal blockade. A similar vagal maneuver may be attempted by placing an ice bag over the eyes and face for approximately 30 seconds.",

Biliary atresia is caused by the abnormal underdevelopment of the extrahepatic biliary system. Affected infants are able to conjugate bilirubin normally in the liver but are unable to excrete bile into the gastrointestinal lumen. Affected infants present with worsening jaundice caused by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, along with pale stool, dark urine, poor weight gain, and, in untreated cases, cirrhosis, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.

        "B": "Decreased hepatic glucuronosyltransferase activity underlies the pathogenesis of Gilbert syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome. Both of these diseases are characterized by defective hepatic conjugation of bilirubin. Accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin is identified by an increased serum concentration of indirect bilirubin. Decreased hepatic Y and Z protein concentrations (Choice C) would interfere with hepatic bilirubin conjugation. These two proteins are involved in the cytosolic binding of bilirubin in hepatocytes and allow for the transport of bilirubin to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum for metabolic processing. Decreased serum bilirubin uptake (Choice D) would occur in hypoalbuminemia. Circulating serum bilirubin is unconjugated and water insoluble. Normal transport of serum bilirubin to the liver is dependent upon normal concentrations of albumin, to which bilirubin is bound and thereby solubilized. Increased serum bilirubin production (Choice E) is suggestive of hemolytic disease, such as sickle cell disease. lntravascular hemolysis can be identified by increased serum concentrations of indirect, or unconjugated, bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, and decreased serum concentrations of haptoglobin."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe complication associated with numerous causes, including sepsis, aspiration, pneumonia, trauma, and shock. The syndrome results from the effect of cytokines on the pulmonary parenchyma following direct or indirect lung injury. This results in endothelial injury with increased vascular permeability. Exudative fluid extends into the alveolar space, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. ARDS is characterized by respiratory failure with bilateral diffuse interstitial and airspace opacities from underlying diffuse alveolar damage and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Mechanical ventilation is often required in the management of ARDS as a result of hypoxemia and hypoventilation.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Cholinergic hyperactivity may result in cholinergic crisis as a result of excessive stimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. In the lungs, this results in decreased lung compliance, bronchoconstriction, and increased bronchial secretions. Potential causes include organophosphate toxicity and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor overdose. Enzymatic deficiency (Choice B) is characteristic of arantitrypsin deficiency, which results in host tissue damage from neutrophil elastase in the lungs and liver. Imaging typically shows emphysematous changes in the bilateral lung bases. Mucosal inflammation (Choice D) occurs with direct lung irritation or injury, as in pulmonary infection, chemical pneumonitis, inflammatory lung disease, foreign body aspiration, and malignancy. ARDS is characterized by increased vascular permeability in the alveoli rather than the mucosa. Oxygen toxicity (Choice E) is a complication of mechanical ventilation with high fraction of inspired oxygen. Exposure to high concentrations of oxygen can lead to cell membrane oxidative damage and collapse of alveoli, with extensive pulmonary edema and development of ARDS. This patient who was otherwise healthy prior to his infection without pulmonary involvement likely has a low fraction of inspired oxygen, and ARDS resulting from sepsis and increased vascular permeability is more likely than oxygen toxicity. Surfactant deficiency (Choice F) is the underlying pathophysiology of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome caused by alveolar collapse in inadequate surfactant production. Surfactant deficiency may also result from drowning injury or aspiration which dilutes the alveolar concentration of surfactant."

It is typically louder when the patient is supine than when the patient is sitting. It most commonly self-resolves by adolescence. Pathologic murmurs are more frequently heard in infants under one year of age, caused by abnormalities such as valve disorders or shunt lesions, whereas murmurs heard after one year of age are more frequently benign, although they can be caused by valve stenosis, regurgitation, or atrial septal defects. Pathologic murmurs also present with related symptoms, such as dyspnea, diaphoresis, or failure to thrive. Further evaluation is recommended for murmurs that are grade 3 or greater in intensity, diastolic, at maximal intensity at the left upper sternal border, holosystolic, or have a harsh or blowing quality. It is also recommended for murmurs that are more intense in the upright position. As this patient has a benign Still murmur, reassurance is appropriate.",

This patient has a benign murmur; a CBC is not indicated. Chest x-rays (Choice C) can be used in the initial evaluation of cyanotic and non-cyanotic congenital heart disease. For example, tetralogy of Fallo! can present with a systolic ejection murmur heard in the left upper sternal border because of pulmonic stenosis, as well as a boot-shaped heart on chest x-ray. However, a chest x-ray in this patient would show no abnormalities.",
        "D": "Echocardiography is used to evaluate the structure and function of the heart. If this patient had a concerning murmur, such as a diastolic grade 4/6 murmur, echocardiography would be the most appropriate next step. However, it plays no role in the evaluation of this benign murmur. Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures (Choice E) is recommended to prevent the development of infective endocarditis for patients with prosthetic heart valves, unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, repaired congenital heart disease (with residual shunts, valvular regurgitation, or an occlusion device), or valve regurgitation in a transplanted heart.

However, when ambient temperature is increased and humidity is high, these mechanisms are less effective at dissipating heat, resulting in heat exhaustion. Heat exhaustion is characterized by exercise intolerance, increased core body temperature, and the absence of neurologic disturbances (eg, altered mental status, confusion, or seizure). It is also associated with dehydration, tachycardia, lightheadedness, muscle cramps, and generalized weakness. Neurologic disturbances are associated with a more severe form of exertional heat illness referred to as heat stroke.

It antagonizes NMDA receptors leading to excitatory neurotransmitter release, inhibits reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, and stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors. Acute PCP intoxication can lead to psychosis, bizarre behavior, agitation, aggression, rotatory nystagmus, and ataxia. Patients may be diaphoretic, tachycardic, and hypertensive because of sympathomimetic effects. Chronic PCP use can lead to major depressive disorder, psychotic symptoms, memory loss, and dysarthria. Control of psychomotor agitation is the first step in management of patients with PCP intoxication for the safety of the patient and medical staff. Chemical sedation with benzodiazepines such as intramuscular lorazepam or midazolam can be administered to control symptoms. Once a patient is adequately sedated, further evaluation can be completed to assess for traumatic injuries or complications of PCP intoxication such as rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, hypertension, seizures, encephalopathy, or a comatose state.",

Type 1 diabetes mellitus can also be complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and patients can present with DKA as their initial manifestation. DKA can also result from increased insulin requirements during times of physiologic stress (eg, infection) or insulin nonadherence. DKA occurs as a result of the accumulation of serum ketones such as beta-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone in the setting of deficient insulin signaling. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs because of the relative state of starvation created through absent insulin signaling. Type 1 diabetes mellitus can also result in dehydration caused by hyperglycemia, glucosuria, and osmotic diuresis. This diuresis can result in dehydration, ketonuria, and orthostasis. Orthostatic vital signs are significant pulse increases greater than 20/min, systolic pressure decreases over 20 mm Hg, or diastolic pressure decreases over 10 mm Hg with changes in position from supine to seated to standing. Because of the patient's osmotic diuresis, orthostatic hypotension, and dehydration, the first step in care requires the administration of 0.9% saline intravenously for fluid resuscitation.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a defect in adrenal steroid biosynthesis, particularly of cortisol, with variable effects on mineralocorticoids and androgens. Because of decreased production of hormones, the adrenal gland is stimulated by the pituitary in an attempt to increase hormone production, leading to adrenal hyperplasia, the namesake of this condition. The most common form of CAH and the cause of this patient's manifestations is 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase deficiency presents with salt wasting in a newborn or precocious puberty in a child, as well as virilization of infants with an XX karyotype (eg, clitoral hypertrophy, labial fusion), caused by increased concentrations of androgens. Because of the enzyme deficiency, concentrations of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone are increased, while aldosterone and cortisol are decreased, leading to hypotension, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (caused by inadequate cortisol). Diffuse hyperpigmentation of the skin, as seen in this newborn, is characteristic. Melanin production is regulated in part by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). MSH is a byproduct of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) which also produces adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In adrenal insufficiency, stimulation of ACTH production by POMC simultaneously produces MSH, leading to diffuse hyperpigmentation in affected patients. Treatment of CAH consists of exogenous glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid supplementation.",

Short stature has a variety of causes, such as constitutional growth delay, familial (hereditary) short stature, chronic steroid use, endocrine abnormalities (eg, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), cardiopulmonary disease, and genetic disorders (eg, Down syndrome, Turner syndrome). Familial short stature and constitutional growth delay are the most common causes of short stature. Familial short stature is associated with short stature in both parents, a normal gain of height velocity, and a bone age that corresponds with chronological age, whereas a constitutional growth delay is independent of parental stature, has a consistently decreased growth velocity, and has a bone age younger than chronological age. Patients with constitutional growth delay may experience a delayed onset of puberty. These patients typically reach a normal adult height, with more rapid increases in height gain velocity as they progress through puberty. This patient has parents with normal stature and a decreased growth velocity, leading to a height that is consistently in the 3rd percentile. He does not have other signs or symptoms to suggest a pathologic cause of short stature, making constitutional growth delay the most likely diagnosis.",

Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency may also demonstrate mineralocorticoid and androgen deficiency, which would present with urinary salt wasting and decreased body hair, respectively. This patient does not demonstrate the symptoms or physical examination signs of adrenal insufficiency. Familial short stature (Choice C) typically presents in young patients whose parents are both of short stature with a normal growth velocity and bone age consistent with chronological age. These patients will remain of short stature into adulthood. This patient has parents with normal stature, making this answer less likely. Growth hormone deficiency (Choice D) is a rare condition that can present in infancy or childhood depending on the severity of deficiency. Acquired growth hormone deficiency is typically caused by a non-functional pituitary tumor and presents with severe growth delay and a bone age younger than chronological age. It is associated with a rapid decline in the height-for-age curve, crossing percentiles. This patient's growth velocity has been slow but consistent, making growth hormone deficiency a less likely cause of his short stature. Insufficient caloric intake (Choice E) typically results in an abnormally low weight along with signs of malnutrition such as dry skin and hair loss (caused by decreased protein stores).

Because of decreased production of hormones, the adrenal gland is stimulated by the pituitary in an attempt to increase hormone production, leading to adrenal hyperplasia, the namesake of this condition. The most common form of CAH and the cause of this patient's manifestations is 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase deficiency presents with salt wasting in a newborn or precocious puberty in a child, as well as virilization of infants with an XX karyotype (eg, clitoral hypertrophy, labial fusion), caused by increased concentrations of androgens. Because of the enzyme deficiency, concentrations of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone are increased, while aldosterone and cortisol are decreased, leading to hypotension, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (caused by inadequate cortisol). Diffuse hyperpigmentation of the skin, as seen in this newborn, is characteristic. Melanin production is regulated in part by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). MSH is a byproduct of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) which also produces adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In adrenal insufficiency, stimulation of ACTH production by POMC simultaneously produces MSH, leading to diffuse hyperpigmentation in affected patients. Treatment of CAH consists of exogenous glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid supplementation.",

Pertussis classically presents in three stages. The catarrhal stage is first, which presents with fever, rhinorrhea, and a mild cough. This progresses to the paroxysmal stage after 1 to 2 weeks, in which patients experience violent bouts of extreme coughing, at times violent enough to cause secondary traumatic injury such as rib fractures, urinary incontinence, pneumothorax, and facial petechiae. Often, such coughing fits are accompanied by cyanosis and may be followed by syncope, emesis, or apnea. The paroxysmal stage can last for weeks to months. Symptoms resolve during the convalescent stage, which lasts from 1 to 4 weeks. Pertussis can be prevented with immunization in the form of acellular pertussis, typically administered along with tetanus and diphtheria vaccines (DTaP). It can be transmitted in respiratory droplets, thus all individuals who come into contact with infected patients should wear a mask and eye protection.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a Gram-negative diplococcus and can cause vaginitis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Vaginitis typically presents with mucopurulent discharge and pruritus. Cervicitis presents with similar discharge, but also with an erythematous, friable cervix and cervical motion tenderness on examination. When infection spreads to the fallopian tubes and ovaries, PID with purulent cervical discharge, uterine and adnexal tenderness, and systemic symptoms such as fever can result. If left untreated, PID can become complicated by a tuba-ovarian abscess or intraabdominal abscess, presenting with focal tenderness and a fluctuant mass; it can cause consequent infertility. Gonorrhea can present with dissemination (tenosynovitis, dermatitis, polyarthralgia) or reactive arthritis. Risk factors for the development of gonorrhea include multiple sexual partners, new sexual partners, receptive anal intercourse, a young age, substance abuse, and inconsistent condom usage. Coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis is common, therefore treatment typically consists of ceftriaxone and doxycycline, with the latter covering a possible concurrent chlamydia! infection while confirmatory tests are pending. In a high-risk exposure to gonorrhea, empiric treatment to cover both N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis is appropriate.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Intramuscular ceftriaxone therapy only would treat gonorrhea. However, risk for coinfection with C. trachomatis is high, and this antibiotic regimen would not cover a chlamydia! infection. Oral azithromycin therapy only (Choice C) would treat a chlamydia! infection. However, this patient has been exposed to gonorrhea and requires additional treatment with ceftriaxone. Oral azithromycin and intramuscular penicillin therapy (Choice D) would cover a chlamydia! infection but would not cover gonorrhea, as N. gonorrhoeae has become increasingly resistant to penicillin. Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline would provide better coverage. No treatment indicated because the patient is asymptomatic (Choice E) is inappropriate, as failure to diagnose and treat this patient could lead to a multitude of complications, such as reactive arthritis, disseminated gonococcal infection, and pelvic inflammatory disease with consequent infertility. She has had a high-risk exposure to gonorrhea and empiric treatment is more appropriate."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Testicular torsion occurs when the testicle rotates about itself within the scrotal sac, resulting in vascular congestion and potential cessation of venous or arterial flow to the testis. Patients typically present with acute, severe testicular pain with diffuse tenderness and swelling and an absent cremasteric reflex. In contrast, patients with torsion of the appendix testis present with groin pain, a nontender testicle, a tender, palpable localized mass adjacent to one pole of the testicle, and an intact cremasteric reflex. The appendix testis is a vestigial structure, typically on the anterior and superior aspect of the testis and has a pedunculated shape that may predispose it to torsion. When torsed, the appendix testis may appear as a small blue or black mass in the scrotum. The diagnosis may be made clinically, or with ultrasound in cases where testicular torsion cannot be excluded. While patients with testicular torsion require surgical detorsion and orchiopexy to prevent infertility, management of torsion of the appendix testis is generally supportive, with analgesics and scrotal support.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Epididymitis is a common cause of painful scrotal swelling and refers to acute infection and inflammation of the epididymis. In younger males, this is commonly secondary to sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Patients with epididymitis may have moderate pain relief with elevation of the testis. Incarcerated hernia (Choice B) refers to the contents of a hernia becoming trapped in the hernia defect, unable to be reduced to native position. If this type of hernia contains bowel, an obstruction can result. An inguinal hernia can become incarcerated, but this would typically present with severe tenderness and a larger mass with swelling in the inguinal area.",
        "C": "Orchitis is inflammation of the testes that results from an infection, sometimes from the paramyxovirus that causes mumps. Clinical manifestations include fever, myalgias, and fatigue. Especially when it occurs after puberty, it is a risk factor for infertility. Testicular hematoma (Choice D) can occur in blunt scrotal trauma and presents with testicular swelling, warmth, and pain. A 3-mm area of bluish discoloration is more likely caused by torsion of an appendix testis, not testicular hematoma, especially with no history of trauma."

Rheumatic fever is a sequela of untreated group A Streptococcus infection, commonly pharyngitis, in which there is a type II hypersensitivity reaction to self-antigens having a similar structure to, and thus molecularly mimicking streptococcal M protein. Diagnosis is made by the Jones criteria, which describe many of the core clinical features of rheumatic fever. The major criteria include polyarthritis, carditis, subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum, and Sydenham chorea; the minor criteria include fever, leukocytosis, arthralgia, and PR interval prolongation. Patients often have an increased antistreptolysin O titer. Biopsy of affected cardiac tissue discloses a granulomatous reaction with presence of Aschoff bodies. Complications of rheumatic fever include mitral valve inflammation leading to long-term sequelae of chronic mitral valve regurgitation, prolapse, or stenosis. Treatment of the initial streptococcal infection is effective for reducing the risk for developing rheumatic fever.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The recommended schedule of hepatitis B immunization and immunoprophylaxis in newborns is dependent on the maternal HBsAg status. HBsAg assay is an important component of prenatal care and is typically checked at the first prenatal visit. If HBsAg is positive or if there are signs of active maternal hepatitis B infection, the newborn should receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) intramuscularly and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) as early as possible, with additional doses of HBV at 2 and 6 months of age. In a HBsAg negative mother, only HBV is needed and doses are given at birth, 2 months, and 6 months. As in this case, if the mother's HBsAg status is unknown but there is no evidence of active infection, the newborn should receive HBV within 12 hours and HBIG can be delayed until the maternal serologies have returned. If the serology returns positive for HBsAg, the infant should receive HBIG within 1 week. If the serology returns negative for HBsAg, the newborn does not require HBIG. In either case, the newborn will still require the second and third doses of HBV at 2 and 6 months, respectively.",

        "A": "Observation only without follow-up of the maternal HBsAg titer is not appropriate. If the titer returns positive or unknown, HBIG should be given. HBIG only now (Choice B) is not necessary. Administration of HBIG to a neonate born to a hepatitis B infected mother may occur within the first week of life, which provides adequate time for the maternal HBsAg assay to return. Even if the maternal HBsAg assay is positive, HBIG at 2 and 6 months of age (Choice C) is not necessary. HBV should be given at these time points but HBIG is only needed at birth. HBV at 2 and 6 months of age (Choice D) will be inadequate if the maternal HBsAg titer is positive."

A 3-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department because of a 5-day history of increased thirst and urination and a 2-day history of decreased activity. Although she had been previously toilet trained and dry at night, she has had several episodes of nocturnal wetting over the past week . She has not had fever, vomiting , or diarrhea . Two weeks ago, she fell off her tricycle , but no injuries were apparent. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 160/min, respirations are 24/min , and blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg.

A) Chronic renal failure B Diabetes insiP.idus C) Diabetes mellitus D) Inappropriate secretion of ADH (vasopressin) E) Psychogenic polydipsia F) Urinary tract infection Correct Answer: B. Central diabetes insipidus may result from head trauma and is characterized by the inadequate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also known as vasopressin) from the posterior pituitary. ADH binds V 2 receptors of the late distal convoluted tubule and the collecting tubule principal cells, which results in the insertion of aquaporin channels in the luminal surface. This results in increased free water absorption and maintains tight regulation of serum osmolality. Inadequate production of ADH by the posterior pituitary gland may occur in various pathologies, such as pituitary tumors, trauma, tuberculosis, or intracranial surgery. This results in a decreased concentration of aquaporin channels inserted within the principal cells of the collecting tubule, leading to an inability to absorb adequate amounts of free water, which causes dilute urine, decreased urine osmolality, hypernatremia, and increased serum osmolality. The hypothalamic osmoreceptors detect this increased serum osmolality, which causes the patient to report extreme thirst. Patients typically also present with production of large volumes of dilute urine, dehydration, and altered mental status. Treatment is with desmopressin, an analog of vasopressin, which results in recovery of free water via aquaporin insertion in the collecting tubule. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, E, and F. Chronic renal failure (Choice A) can have variable etiology, and in children it may be caused by intrinsic renal disease such as polycystic kidney disease, chronic nephritic or nephrotic glomerular disease, or congenital urinary tract abnormalities leading to postrenal obstructive disease.

It would be unlikely in this patient with normal creatinine and no history of kidney impairment. Diabetes mellitus (Choice C) can occur in children because of autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet cells, leading to impaired insulin production and hyperglycemia. In this patient with normal glucose concentrations and imbalanced serum and urine osmolality, central diabetes insipidus is more likely. Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (vasopressin) (Choice D) can occur secondary to head trauma, but involves excess ADH production, which leads to euvolemic hyponatremia. Psychogenic polydipsia (Choice E) refers to excess intake of free water. Excess free water consumption dilutes urea and sodium which are lost in diuresis; the resultant lack of concentration of sodium and urea within the renal interstitium results in loss of ability to concentrate urine. This results in hyponatremia, decreased serum osmolality, and decreased urine osmolality. Urinary tract infection (Choice F) can present with dysuria, urinary frequency, foul-smelling urine, suprapubic discomfort, and fever. In pediatric patients, it can also cause nocturia, but this patient does not have any other signs of a urinary tract infection. It would not cause hypernatremia and increased serum osmolality. Educational Objective: Central diabetes insipidus may result from head trauma and is characterized by the inadequate secretion of ADH from the posterior pituitary. Patients typically present with large volumes of dilute urine, dehydration, thirst, and increased serum osmolality. r \" , r-- r ,",

Because of decreased production of hormones, the adrenal gland is stimulated by the pituitary in an attempt to increase hormone production, leading to adrenal hyperplasia, the namesake of this condition. The most common form of CAH and the cause of this patient's manifestations is 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase deficiency presents with salt wasting in a newborn or precocious puberty in a child, as well as virilization of infants with an XX karyotype (eg, clitoral hypertrophy, labial fusion), caused by increased concentrations of androgens. Because of the enzyme deficiency, concentrations of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone are increased, while aldosterone and cortisol are decreased, leading to hypotension, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (caused by inadequate cortisol). Diffuse hyperpigmentation of the skin, as seen in this newborn, is characteristic. Melanin production is regulated in part by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). MSH is a byproduct of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) which also produces adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In adrenal insufficiency, stimulation of ACTH production by POMC simultaneously produces MSH, leading to diffuse hyperpigmentation in affected patients.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This child presents with leukocoria (a white pupillary reflex) and a sensory exotropia, which is suggestive of retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is a malignant proliferation of retinal neuroendocrine cells and is the most common ophthalmic malignancy in children. Retinoblastoma results from inactivating mutations of both copies of the RB1 gene, which functions as a tumor suppressor by halting cell cycle progression at the G1 checkpoint. RB1 mutations may be either acquired or inherited. In cases of germline RB1 mutation, a single mutated allele is inherited, and the second allele acquires a subsequent mutation during development. Infants who carry germline mutations are more likely to have bilateral retinoblastoma with multiple foci of tumors in the eye, whereas infants with two acquired mutations are more likely to have unilateral retinoblastoma. Ultrasound of the eye is helpful for defining the size of the lesion and for detecting characteristic intralesional calcifications. Within the eye, large tumor size, tumor seeding of the vitreous humor, and involvement of the iris or anterior chamber are associated with a worse prognosis. If undetected, retinoblastoma may invade the optic nerve, leading to a greater risk for metastasis to the brain. Most cases of retinoblastoma may be successfully managed with chemotherapy, although advanced cases may require enucleation with special attention paid to achieving negative margins at the optic nerve, as cases that have undergone metastasis have a poor prognosis.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Acquired exotropia may result from visual sensory deprivation in a non-seeing eye. However, exotropia will not cause leukocoria. Chronic endophthalmitis (Choice B) typically results from hematogenous spread of bacteria or fungus or following ocular surgery. This infant is not ill appearing and lacks a history suggestive of a likely cause of endophthalmitis. Eyes affected by endophthalmitis are often painful and have conjunctiva! injection. Congenital glaucoma (Choice C) presents with characteristic findings including buphthalmos (an enlarged eye), a large cornea, which may be edematous and opacified, and increased intraocular pressure. Infants typically present with epiphora, photophobia, and blepharospasm or eye rubbing. Congenital glaucoma does not cause leukocoria. Familial cataract (Choice D) may be either unilateral or bilateral and may be associated with chromosomal abnormalities or inherited mutations in a variety of genes. Congenital cataracts are present at birth. This child has developed a wandering eye after normal development for the first several months of life, which is more consistent with a diagnosis of retinoblastoma."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Wheezing that does not improve with nebulized albuterol, hyperinflation of the right lung, and acute onset of difficulty breathing and cough raises suspicion for foreign body aspiration. Foreign body aspiration can cause obstruction of the airway, leading to impaired oxygenation and ventilation. Children from 1 to 3 years old are at increased risk for foreign body aspiration because of their ability to stand and mobilize independently, ability to grasp and put small objects into their mouths, and an immature swallowing mechanism. Foreign bodies can be located anywhere in the airway between the larynx and the bronchi. Children can present with severe respiratory distress, cyanosis, and stridor, or may have a less severe presentation with partial airway obstruction, presenting with cough, tachypnea, decreased air entry on auscultation, or wheezing. Chest x-ray can show hyperinflation of one lung, which is caused by air trapping and partial airway obstruction in which air is able to pass via inspiration, but not exhalation. Foreign bodies are typically in the right lung because of the more vertical anatomic position of the right main bronchus. Management of foreign body aspiration involves flexible or rigid bronchoscopy to remove the object. Object removal is necessary and retained foreign bodies can be complicated by airway inflammation and infection.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Chest percussion and physiotherapy can be beneficial for patients with mucus plugging of small airways, such as in cystic fibrosis. Chest percussion can help dislodge mucus and improve its clearance by coughing. Oral administration of amoxicillin (Choice B) would be indicated if the patient presented with a bacterial illness, such as pneumonia, streptococcal pharyngitis, or acute otitis media. Patients with pneumonia can also present with cough, however it is typically a subacute onset and a chest x-ray would show localized infiltrate or opacification in an area of the lung. Oral administration of corticosteroids (Choice C) would be helpful in a patient with moderate to severe acute asthma exacerbation along with nebulized albuterol. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation of airways and have been shown to decrease hospitalizations for asthma. This patient's wheezing did not improve with nebulized albuterol, making acute asthma exacerbation less likely. Subcutaneous administration of epinephrine (Choice D) would not be indicated in this patient. Intramuscular epinephrine is used in the emergent treatment of anaphylaxis, which can be characterized by urticaria, vomiting, diarrhea, wheezing, stridor, oropharyngeal swelling, and airway obstruction. However, this patient's wheezing is more likely caused by foreign body aspiration and the patient has no other signs of anaphylaxis. Furthermore, intramuscular epinephrine is preferred over subcutaneous administration because of its more rapid and reliable onset."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Legg-Calve-Perthes disease refers to idiopathic avascular necrosis of the femoral head that most commonly occurs in younger boys aged 4 to 9 years. The classic presentation includes slow onset of hip pain which is worsened by activity and associated with a limp. The pain may or may not be relieved with rest. X-rays often show no abnormalities. However, bone scan characteristically shows decreased perfusion of the femoral head, as in this case. MRI may also be considered for diagnosis and will show bone marrow changes. Treatments include preventing weight-bearing on the affected leg and, occasionally, may require operative intervention or hip arthroplasty. Inadequate treatment results in fragmentation and subsequent deformity of the femoral head.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Ankylosing spondylitis is a rheumatologic inflammatory condition involving the vertebrae that presents with subacute to chronic back pain and limited range of motion that is improved with exercise. The resultant arthropathy can result in frequent falls and fractures, however without back pain or any systemic inflammatory manifestations, it would be an unlikely diagnosis in this case. Pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (Choice C), also called oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, is most common in girls aged 2 to 3 years. It presents with swelling of a single joint, often the knee, with accompanied limping but no pain. On examination, the involved joints are swollen and tender without erythema. Unlike other forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic manifestations are characteristically absent. Septic arthritis (Choice D) results from bacterial infection of the synovial joint space, most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus. The affected joint demonstrates pain, swelling, and erythema. Arthrocentesis is indicated for the evaluation of monoarticular erythema and swelling to evaluate for septic arthritis, which characteristically shows purulent synovial fluid with greater than 50,000 leukocytes per mm"

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Meningitis in infants is commonly caused by bacteria and can present with fever or hypothermia, lethargy, irritability, altered mental status, a bulging fontanelle, poor feeding, and seizures. Diagnosis of meningitis typically involves lumbar puncture, and evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid will show an increased white blood cell count with predominant neutrophils, increased protein, and decreased glucose. Thorough evaluation also includes a complete blood count, blood culture, and urine culture to evaluate for other causes of sepsis, as well as culture of the cerebrospinal fluid to determine the causative organism. This patient has signs of sepsis, a systemic inflammatory syndrome that may occur in response to infection. Sepsis can be complicated by shock and multiorgan failure with a high mortality rate. Septic shock is characterized by vasoplegia (impaired response of the vasculature to vasoconstricting stimuli) with markedly decreased systemic vascular resistance, tachycardia, increased cardiac output, oliguria, and lactic acidosis. The initial step for management in septic shock involves emergency antibiotics and fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids, such as 0.9% saline. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, and E. Administration of dopamine (Choice A) or epinephrine (Choice B) may be indicated in this patient if the patient continues to be hypotensive after a trial of fluid resuscitation. Fluid administration should be the initial step for resuscitation of septic shock. Administration of sodium bicarbonate (Choice D) would be unlikely to be beneficial in this patient, as this patient's pH is normal. Administration of sodium bicarbonate may be helpful in patients who are acidotic. Endotracheal intubation (Choice E) would not be emergently indicated in this patient as the patient is breathing, ventilating, and oxygenating well as shown on arterial blood gas analysis. The patient's hypotension and hemodynamic instability would also cause increased risk for cardiac arrest if endotracheal intubation were attempted.

Incorrect Answers: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I. Anemia, acute hemorrhagic, (Choice A) describes massive blood loss that leads to anemia. This is common in trauma and presents with anemia in the absence of leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Anemia, autoimmune hemolytic (Choice C), results from the binding of an autoantibody to red blood cell surface antigens, leading to removal via the reticuloendothelial system or to intravascular hemolysis.

Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (Choice E) results in hemolysis upon exposure to certain medications such as sulfa drugs and oxidants. It does not cause marked leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Hereditary spherocytosis (Choice F) is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in ankyrin, spectrin, and band erythrocyte membrane proteins that lead to a loss of the normal connection between the inner membrane skeleton and the outer lipid bilayer. Clinical symptoms can include jaundice, splenomegaly, and anemia. Peripheral smear shows spherocytes. Sickle cell disease (Choice G) is caused by mutations in both ~-globin alleles that result in an abnormal hemoglobin S, which polymerizes in hypoxia and causes sickling of erythrocytes. Patients have anemia and sickle forms on peripheral blood smear. Sickle cell trait (Choice H) is caused by a mutation in one ~-globin allele. It infrequently causes symptoms associated with sickle cell disease such as severe anemia and acute pain crisis. Anemia, if present, is mild. Other cell lines show no abnormalities. Thalassemia minor (Choice I) can occur as a result of mutations or deletions in one of the ~-globin alleles or in one or more of the a-globin alleles, leading to impaired production of hemoglobin A. Patients have a mild microcytic anemia and normal concentrations of leukocytes and platelets. Hemoglobin electrophoresis can distinguish between these two entities."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a slow-growing mycobacterial organism transmitted via respiratory secretions. It presents with primary, latent, and reactivation patterns. In primary disease, patients present with subacute fevers, weight loss, night sweats, cough, and malaise. Latent tuberculosis can occur as the organism proliferates within macrophages and is maintained within caseating granulomas. PPD skin testing stimulates a T-lymphocyte driven type IV hypersensitivity reaction against subdermal tuberculin antigen. Causes of false positive PPD testing include prior vaccination with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine. This patient's positive test result likely represents a true positive. Her most significant risk factor for tuberculosis is volunteering in a skilled nursing care facility, as tuberculosis is more common and spreads more easily in crowded populations, such as in nursing facilities and prisons .

      "correct_answer_explanation": "HIV infection, acquired via vertical transmission from the patient's mother, is the most likely cause of the patient's recurrent pneumococcal pneumonia, otitis media, and herpes zoster infection with axillary lymphadenopathy. HIV transmission may occur at any time during gestation but is most commonly acquired at or around the time of delivery and in the immediate postpartum period during breastfeeding. Transmission is uncommon if the mother is taking antiretroviral therapy and has a decreased HIV viral load. As a result of screening for HIV in most developed countries, the incidence of perinatal and pediatric HIV infection has decreased, although this is not true around the world. While many pediatric patients with perinatally acquired HIV infection will manifest symptoms within the first few months to years, it has been recognized that a subpopulation of patients will not develop symptoms or AIDS-defining conditions until many years later, as in this case. Symptoms in children are non-specific, and AIDS-defining conditions in children younger than six vary slightly from those in older children and adults. Clues to the diagnosis in this case include the presence of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in the patient's mother, which is an AIDS-defining illness and should prompt evaluation for HIV infection in this patient.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Chronic granulomatous disease is caused by NADPH oxidase deficiency and results in impaired intracellular killing of catalase positive pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae is catalase negative. Patients present with recurrent pyogenic infections with organisms such as S. aureus. Hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome (Choice C) is caused by mutations in the JAK-STAT signaling cascade, which impairs the development and function of T helper 17 (Th n) cells. Th cells secrete interleukin-17 17 (IL-17), a potent neutrophil chemotaxis agent, so deficiency results in poor neutrophil migration to sites of infection. Patients have recurrent skin infections but with non-inflamed abscesses (cold abscess) and diffuse atopic dermatitis. Thymic-parathyroid dysplasia (DiGeorge syndrome) (Choice D) is caused by a 22q11 deletion that leads to failure of the third and fourth branchial pouches to develop. These structures give rise to the thymus and parathyroid glands, and their absence leads to thymic aplasia and hypocalcemia in cardiac and craniofacial defects. Patients are susceptible to viral and fungal infections. a X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Choice E) occurs as result of mutations in the BTK gene that encodes a tyrosine kinase essential for all stages of B-lymphocyte development and proliferation. Patients lack functioning B lymphocytes, and therefore, lack normal concentrations of immunoglobulins. It nearly always presents within the first eighteen months of life with recurrent infections. It is more common in male patients given X-linked inheritance."

Motor vehicle collisions, falls, and sports injuries are common causes of this type of injury. A rapid deceleration injury, such as caused by a fall, can cause the kidney to be crushed against the paravertebral muscles, avulsed from the ureteropelvic junction or the renal vessels, or thrombosed. In any of these cases, blood supply to the kidney is interrupted. Flank tenderness, flank bruising, or lower rib fractures should all raise concern for blunt kidney injury. Hematuria is a common presenting symptom seen in over two-thirds of patients with blunt renal injury. It should be investigated quickly with measurement of urine blood as part of the initial trauma assessment, as intravenous fluid administration can dilute hematuria and preclude detection.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Droplet isolation or droplet precautions, in which the eyes, nose, and mouth are covered by glasses and a mask, would be the most effective way to prevent nosocomial spread of 8ordetella pertussis, an infection characterized by episodes of severe paroxysmal coughing and post-tussive emesis. Pertussis classically presents in three stages. The catarrhal stage is first, which presents with fever, rhinorrhea, and a mild cough. This progresses to the paroxysmal stage after 1 to 2 weeks, in which patients experience violent bouts of extreme coughing, at times violent enough to cause secondary traumatic injury such as rib fractures, urinary incontinence, pneumothorax, and facial petechiae. Often, such coughing fits are accompanied by cyanosis and may be followed by syncope, emesis, or apnea. The paroxysmal stage can last for weeks to months. Symptoms resolve during the convalescent stage, which lasts from 1 to 4 weeks. Pertussis can be prevented with immunization in the form of acellular pertussis, typically administered along with tetanus and diphtheria vaccines (DTaP). It can be transmitted in respiratory droplets, thus all individuals who come into contact with infected patients should wear a mask and eye protection.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Antiviral therapy for all health care workers can be given with oseltamivir in an influenza outbreak, but 8. pertussis is a bacterial infection and would not be treated with an antiviral medication. Contact isolation (Choice B) is reserved for pathogens such as C/ostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and others that are easily transmitted through contact with the skin. These precautions involve the wearing of disposable gloves and gowns. Erythromycin therapy for all healthcare workers (Choice D) could be considered in instances of a 8. pertussis outbreak, which can occur if the index case is not recognized or droplet precautions are not instituted but is not necessary in this case. Intravenous immune globulin therapy for all health care workers (Choice E) is not used for post-exposure prophylaxis for 8. pertussis. Intravenous immune globulin therapy for patients (Choice F) is occasionally given after exposure to certain pathogens. For example, those exposed to rabies are given both rabies immune globulin and a rabies vaccine. Pertussis vaccination for all healthcare workers (Choice G) is not correct. While all adults should receive the tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) every 10 years, infection can occur even in patients who have recently been vaccinated. The best method of preventing infection is the use of droplet precautions. Pertussis vaccination for the patient (Choice H) will not change her disease course, although vaccination is still recommended at 4 months, 6 months, 15 months, and at age 4. No intervention (Choice I) is not appropriate as failure to contain this infection could lead to exposure of many other patients and staff."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient's presentation with distal thigh swelling is concerning for a fracture of the diaphysis of the femur. Femoral fractures are a common long bone fracture in children, with peaks of incidence in toddlers because of accidental trauma and adolescents because of motor vehicle collisions. A femoral shaft fracture may be complicated by shortening of the muscles of the knee and hip which causes the fractured femur to displace, so early recognition and intervention is needed to prevent permanent limb length discrepancy. Clinically, most femoral shaft fractures will demonstrate obvious deformity, swelling, shortening, or crepitus on examination. A neurovascular examination distal to the site of swelling should be performed to ensure that the fracture has not caused damage to nerves or arteries. The next step in management of a suspected femoral fracture is radiographic assessment using standard anterior-posterior and lateral plain x-rays of the affected area and the joints above and below the suspected fracture. This ensures correct diagnosis and assists in management planning.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Reassurance and application of local heat (Choice B) are not appropriate in this case as the suspected femoral fracture will need to be immobilized and may require operative intervention. In cases of mild musculoskeletal injuries that do not require medical evaluation, application of ice is more effective than application of heat. Range of motion exercises (Choice D) may be needed following complete healing of the femoral fracture, but if performed now without adequate treatment, they would likely worsen the fracture. Immobilization is an important step in treatment of a femoral fracture. Acetaminophen therapy (Choice E) may be used for mild musculoskeletal complaints and is safe for use in children. However, treating pain without addressing the underlying cause, such as a fracture, is not appropriate."

Familial short stature and constitutional growth delay are the most common causes of short stature. Familial short stature is associated with short stature in both parents, a normal gain of height velocity, and a bone age that corresponds with chronological age, whereas a constitutional growth delay is independent of parental stature, has a consistently decreased growth velocity, and has a bone age younger than chronological age. Patients with constitutional growth delay may experience a delayed onset of puberty. These patients typically reach a normal adult height, with more rapid increases in height gain velocity as they progress through puberty. This patient has parents with normal stature and a decreased growth velocity, leading to a height that is consistently in the 3rd percentile.

Growth hormone deficiency (Choice D) is a rare condition that can present in infancy or childhood depending on the severity of deficiency. Acquired growth hormone deficiency is typically caused by a non-functional pituitary tumor and presents with severe growth delay and a bone age younger than chronological age. It is associated with a rapid decline in the height-for-age curve, crossing percentiles. This patient's growth velocity has been slow but consistent, making growth hormone deficiency a less likely cause of his short stature. Insufficient caloric intake (Choice E) typically results in an abnormally low weight along with signs of malnutrition such as dry skin and hair loss (caused by decreased protein stores). This patient has a normal weight and lacks physical examination signs of malnutrition."

The most common form of CAH and the cause of this patient's manifestations is 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase deficiency presents with salt wasting in a newborn or precocious puberty in a child, as well as virilization of infants with an XX karyotype (eg, clitoral hypertrophy, labial fusion), caused by increased concentrations of androgens.

Normal fetal circulation is unique in that oxygenated blood arrives from the maternal circulation via the umbilical vein and reaches the inferior vena cava. From there, oxygenated blood is shunted from the right atrium to the left atrium, left ventricle {LV), and systemic circulation. The fetal lungs are filled with amniotic fluid while in utero, so the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is high. In patients with a VSD, increased PVR effectively prevents left-to-right shunting of blood from the LV to the right ventricle (RV). At birth, amniotic fluid is cleared and expelled from the lungs and the PVR decreases dramatically, followed by a gradual decrease in PVR over the next several weeks. As the PVR decreases, the pressure gradient between the LV and the RV increases such that blood is shunted from the LV to the RV with each cardiac cycle. This change in PVR explains the change in the patient's murmur.",

Pertussis occurs because of an infection from Bordetella pertussis and classically presents in three stages. The catarrhal stage is first, which presents with fever, rhinorrhea, and a mild cough. This progresses to the paroxysmal stage after one to two weeks, in which patients experience violent bouts of extreme coughing, at times violent enough to cause secondary traumatic injury such as rib fractures, urinary incontinence, and pneumothorax. Often, such coughing fits are accompanied by cyanosis and may be followed by syncope, emesis, or apnea. The paroxysmal stage can last for weeks to months. Symptoms resolve during the convalescent stage, which lasts from one to four weeks. Pertussis toxin causes impaired recruitment and migration of phagocytes and production of inflammatory mediators. Patients often have significant lymphocytosis. Pertussis can be prevented with immunization in the form of acellular pertussis, typically administered along with tetanus and diphtheria vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends administering the vaccine in a multiple dose series beginning at two months of age. Pertussis is treated with antibiotics (typically macrolides) and supportive care.",

The causes of Al, also called aortic regurgitation, include bicuspid aortic valve, aortic root dilation, and a history of rheumatic heart disease. It is also commonly associated with syndromes such as Marfan and Turner syndrome. Al results from an incompetent aortic valve that allows retrograde blood flow from the aortic root to the left ventricle (LV) during diastole. This results in an increased LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) as both blood from the aorta and the left atrium fill the LV. Increased volume stretches the compliant ventricle thereby increasing myocardial contractility, which is reflected as an increased stroke volume (SV) and a comparatively increased cardiac output.

Eventually, left-sided heart failure can lead to increased PVR, but this occurs over time and the patient in this case shows no symptoms of pulmonary hypertension or cor pulmonale. Increased systemic cardiac output (Choice B) is incorrect. In compensated Al, the cardiac output is maintained, but over time the progressive hypertrophy of the LV in combination with ongoing aortic regurgitation leads to systolic dysfunction and decreased cardiac output. Increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (Choice C) is incorrect. SVR tends to be relatively normal in individuals with chronic compensated Al, although they tend to have a greater disparity between systolic and diastolic pressures. The large volume ejected during systole transiently increases the systolic pressure while the regurgitant volume back into the LV leads to a lower than expected diastolic pressure. Left ventricular pressure overload (Choice D) is incorrect. In young patients with chronic Al and no evidence of heart failure, the LV is able to compensate for increased end-diastolic volume by distending, thereby maintaining a normal LV end-diastolic pressure. Over time, however, eccentric hypertrophy can cause diastolic dysfunction and increased LV pressure."

Poor weight gain is a common diagnosis seen in primary care offices in approximately 5% of pediatric patients. Risk factors include prematurity, developmental delay, congenital abnormalities, or any condition resulting in inadequate intake, absorption, or metabolism of nutrients. Poverty, social isolation, certain nutritional beliefs and practices, poor parenting skills, substance abuse, violence, or other abuse also predispose to poor weight gain. The first step in evaluation of poor weight gain is to take a thorough history of dietary practices and review of systems. If no suspected underlying organic cause is found, management of mild malnutrition should involve parental education and dietary advice, changes to dietary practices, provision of home-based support and referral to community or governmental programs to increase access to food. Recommending a diet diary with calorie counts will both investigate whether inadequate caloric intake is the cause of the child's poor weight gain and also assist caregivers in creating a personalized feeding plan.",

During development, this plexus migrates cephalad to caudal and incomplete migration results in absence of the plexus in the distal portion of the gastrointestinal tract. This often leads to an inability to pass meconium within the first few days of life and, eventually, large bowel obstruction. An explosive expulsion of feces on rectal examination is a common clinical finding. Barium enema is used to evaluate for congenital megacolon in children. Congenital megacolon is associated with Down syndrome. Patients with Down syndrome are also at increased risk for dementia (Alzheimer type), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, cardiac septal defects, and duodenal atresia.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Dilation of lymphatic vessels of the bowel caused by obstruction is found in intestinal lymphangiectasia. Loss of lymphocytes into the gut secondary to this dilation can lead to lymphopenia and subsequent immunosuppression. It does not contribute to failure to pass meconium after birth. Duodenal atresia (Choice C) is caused by failure of re-canalization of duodenal lumen. Duodenal atresia presents with vomiting and abdominal distension, as well as distension of the stomach and duodenum on abdominal x-ray. Like congenital megacolon, duodenal atresia is more common in children with Down syndrome. Pancreatic enzyme insufficiency (Choice D) is seen in cystic fibrosis because of destruction of the pancreatic duct. The absence of the digestive enzymes made by the pancreas leads to malnutrition (eg, cachexia, muscle wasting), weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and frequent, loose, foul-smelling, sometimes oily stools (steatorrhea). Cystic fibrosis may also present with meconium ileus, another cause of failure to pass stool after birth. However, this patient's presentation is more characteristic of congenital megacolon. Villous atrophy (Choice E) in the small bowel is a characteristic finding of Celiac disease. Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy which causes inflammatory infiltration of the proximal small bowel, which leads to characteristic intraepithelial lymphocytosis, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. Malabsorption of substances in the proximal small bowel ensues, which presents symptomatically as chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, and nutritional deficiencies."

This impairs the erythrocyte's ability to confirm in small vessels of the microcirculation, especially within the spleen , where spherocytes accumulate. Patients often present with splenomegaly, hemolytic anemia, and pigmented gallstones.

Because of decreased production of hormones, the adrenal gland is stimulated by the pituitary in an attempt to increase hormone production, leading to adrenal hyperplasia, the namesake of this condition. The most common form of CAH and the cause of this patient's manifestations is 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase deficiency presents with salt wasting in a newborn or precocious puberty in a child, as well as virilization of infants with an XX karyotype (eg, clitoral hypertrophy, labial fusion), caused by increased concentrations of androgens. Because of the enzyme deficiency, concentrations of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone are increased, while aldosterone and cortisol are decreased, leading to hypotension, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (caused by inadequate cortisol). Diffuse hyperpigmentation of the skin, as seen in this newborn, is characteristic. Melanin production is regulated in part by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). MSH is a byproduct of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) which also produces adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In adrenal insufficiency, stimulation of ACTH production by POMC simultaneously produces MSH, leading to diffuse hyperpigmentation in affected patients.

Factor VIII is required as a cofactor for the activation of factor X to factor Xa, which in turn converts prothrombin to thrombin to complete the process of clot formation.

As a result of primarily autosomal dominant mutations in genes expressed in Schwann cells, the myelinating cells of the peripheral nervous system, peripheral sensory and motor nerves become progressively demyelinated. Patients demonstrate motor weakness and decreased sensation to vibration and proprioception most prominent in the distal lower extremities. Physical examination findings include hyporeflexia or areflexia, along with clumsy walking and consequent musculoskeletal deformities such as pes cavus (high arch of the foot) and hammer toes (toes with an abnormal upward bend of the middle joint). Later in the disease course, atrophy of the lower extremity muscles and intrinsic hand muscle weakness and atrophy may occur. Diagnosis occurs via nerve conduction studies, which may show decreased conduction velocities and prolonged distal motor latencies consistent with demyelinating disease (some disease subtypes show decreased amplitudes suggestive of axonal loss). Treatment is supportive and includes physical therapy.",

Diabetic neuropathy (Choice C) is an acquired, symmetric polyneuropathy that predominantly affects the sensory nerves of the distal lower and upper extremities. Motor weakness typically occurs only in severe cases, after years of hyperglycemia. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Choice D), caused by an inherited mutation in the dystrophin gene, typically presents at age 2 to 3 years with progressive muscle weakness affecting the proximal more than the distal muscles. Cardiac conduction abnormalities are also common. Sensory neuropathy would be atypical. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (Choice E) an inherited muscular dystrophy resulting in slowly progressive, asymmetric muscle weakness in the facial, scapular, upper arm, lower leg, and abdominal muscles.

However, osseous fragility would be atypical. Teratogenicity of phenytoin (Choice E) commonly causes orofacial clefts, cardiac malformations, and genitourinary defects.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Bolus of methylprednisolone B) Intravenous administration of calcium chloride C) Intravenous administration of 0.9% sodium chloride D) Plasmapheresis E) Hemodialysis Correct Answer: B. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder with a wide range of presentations. Cutaneous manifestations include an erythematous rash over the malar cheeks that spares the nasolabial folds after sun exposure or discoid lesions with hyperpigmented edges and pink, atrophic centers. Painless oral ulcers and nonspecific hair loss may also occur. Fatigue, joint pain, and a fever are also common presenting signs. Lupus nephritis is a complication of SLE and is common in younger women; it can present with hypertension, hematuria, and increased creatinine in the setting of SLE. Laboratory evaluation generally shows a low complement concentration. Lupus nephritis leads to acute kidney injury (AKI) with increased creatinine, which can present with oliguria or anuria. Patients may be asymptomatic or demonstrate symptoms of uremia (eg, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, altered mental status), hyperkalemia (eg, peaked T waves on ECG), and hypervolemia if the AKI is severe. Severe hyperkalemia leads to decreased myocardial excitability resulting in repolarization abnormalities, conduction dysfunction, heart block, and bradycardia. These abnormalities can manifest on an ECG with peaked T waves, PR interval prolongation, loss of P waves, and, if severe, widened QRS complex and bradycardia. Hyperkalemia resulting in ECG changes requires the emergent administration of calcium gluconate or calcium chloride to induce cardiac cell membrane stabilization. Further treatment after calcium may involve insulin and glucose, ~-adrenergic agonists, or bicarbonate to shift potassium into cells, loop diuretics to facilitate the urinary excretion of potassium, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate to promote binding of potassium within the lumen of the gut. For severe or refractory cases, dialysis may be necessary. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Bolus of methylprednisolone (Choice A) may be used in the treatment of severe manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus, such as lupus nephritis in this patient. However, immediate management of the patient's hyperkalemia with calcium chloride would be the next appropriate step in management. Intravenous administration of 0.9% sodium chloride (Choice C) is less appropriate than stabilization of the cardiac membrane with calcium. This patient does have mild hyponatremia, likely caused by renal failure and volume overload. Immediate management should be focused on hyperkalemia, which can be complicated by bradycardia and cardiac arrest. Plasmapheresis (Choice D) would not be the next step in management for this patient as it does not significantly affect the potassium concentration. Plasmapheresis can be used for the removal of circulating immune complexes or pathogenic antibodies, such as in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Patients with severe hyperkalemia may require hemodialysis (Choice E), however, the first step requires the administration of calcium chloride to emergently stabilize the myocardial membrane prior to attempting to lower potassium concentrations with medications and/or dialysis, if refractory. Educational Objective: Acute renal failure can lead to hypertension and hyperkalemia. Severe hyperkalemia resulting in ECG changes requires the emergent administration of calcium gluconate or calcium chloride to induce cardiac cell membrane stabilization. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 43 of 50 'I 43 .

Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that irreversibly inactivates cyclooxygenase, which prevents the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2: Thromboxane A is involved in platelet activation and its decreased 2 synthesis results in diminished platelet activation. Beyond its effect on platelets, salicylate poisoning in large doses results in a respiratory alkalosis from the stimulation of respiratory centers causing hyperventilation. Subsequently, it results in the development of a delayed anion-gap metabolic acidosis secondary to its decoupling effects on the electron transport chain, resulting in increased anaerobic metabolism and the production of lactate and ketoacids beyond the acidic properties of salicylic acid itself. It does not typically affect sodium and potassium serum concentrations. Patients with salicylate toxicity will present with hyperventilation, gastrointestinal upset, hyperthermia, tinnitus, agitation, delirium, and hallucinations. Management of salicylate toxicity involves systemic alkalinization with a sodium bicarbonate infusion. Patients may need dialysis in the setting of severe altered mental status, end-stage kidney disease, pulmonary edema, or clinical deterioration.",

        "A": "Salicylate poisoning would be unlikely to cause hyponatremia or hyperkalemia (Choices A and B). Hyperkalemia commonly occurs in renal insufficiency, aldosterone deficiency, and renal tubular acidosis. Salicylate toxicity results in an anion-gap metabolic acidosis secondary to the production of lactate and ketoacids and would not result in a normal or increased bicarbonate concentration (Choices A, D, and E). While patients may have respiratory alkalosis during the early stages of salicylate poisoning, it would not cause a metabolic alkalosis and would not present with hypernatremia (Choice E)."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a chronic pruritic inflammatory skin disease common in children that is suggested by pruritus and recurrent eczematous rashes. The rash is initially characterized by erythematous papules and vesicles with exudates and crusting and, with chronic scratching, becomes dry, scaly, and excoriated in a process called lichenification. Flexural dermatitis (eg, in the antecubital fossae) is a common pattern in children and adults with atopic dermatitis, but babies demonstrate a unique pattern, which primarily involves the bilateral cheeks and diaper area, as these areas are both frequently moist and subject to irritation. Treatment of atopic dermatitis begins with gentle skin care: minimizing long baths in warm water which causes drying of the skin, avoiding products with fragrance, and use of bland moisturizers such as petroleum jelly daily. In the case of an infant, keeping the cheeks dry and frequent diaper changes are also important. Flares of eczema are treated with mild- to moderate-potency topical corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone. In children, a moderate-potency topical corticosteroid should not be used consistently for over 2 to 3 weeks because of the potential of systemic absorption, particularly in the diaper area.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Candidiasis can affect mucous membranes or skin. Oral candidiasis demonstrates thick, white plaques on the tongue or buccal mucosa, which can be scraped off. Cutaneous candidiasis demonstrates red, macerated thin plaques with satellite papules. Candidiasis is a common cause of diaper rash, but in this case, given the additional findings on the face, atopic dermatitis is more likely. Food allergy (Choice C) rarely contributes to atopic dermatitis. Patients with diaper dermatitis caused or worsened by food allergy will also demonstrate gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, which is absent in this case. There is no role for specific food avoidance diets in the treatment of pediatric atopic dermatitis. Tinea corporis (Choice D) is caused by a superficial dermatophyte infection of the skin, most often Trichophyton tonsurans. The classic appearance is a round, annular patch with a scaly border. Potassium hydroxide preparation will disclose hyphae. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (Choice E) is a life-threatening adverse cutaneous drug reaction. Features such as skin pain, sloughing, or mucosal involvement are concerning for toxic epidermal necrolysis. This patient's lichenified papules and plaques are more consistent with atopic dermatitis."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Precocious puberty is defined as the onset of pubertal development and secondary sexual characteristics prior to 8 years of age in girls and 9 years of age in boys. Precocious puberty can be central, which is caused by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This early activation can be idiopathic or caused by central nervous system abnormalities, such as a brain tumor. Precocious puberty can also be peripheral, which is caused by the release of excess sex hormones from the gonads or adrenal glands, or potentially the ectopic production of human chorionic gonadotropin from a germ-cell tumor. Initial evaluation involves the measurement of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone {LH), and estradiol or testosterone, which allows the provider to differentiate between central and peripheral causes of precocious puberty. Central precocious puberty is further evaluated with brain imaging, whereas peripheral precocious puberty is further evaluated with ultrasonography of the testes, ovaries, or adrenal glands. Treatment is dependent on the underlying pathology. As testicular size is based on the production of FSH, this patient more likely has a peripheral cause of precocious puberty with hyperandrogenism leading to inhibition of the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), FSH, and LH. Adrenal causes of precocious puberty include congenital adrenal hyperplasia and androgen-secreting tumors. Treatment for precocious puberty is dependent on the underlying pathology.",

This patient's laboratory testing instead demonstrates increased TSH concentrations, which indicates a dysfunctional thyroid gland as the cause of hypothyroidism. Measurement of serum thyroid-binding globulin concentration (Choice C) or a thyroid scan (Choice E) may ultimately be indicated to elucidate the cause of hypothyroidism. However, the physician must first perform repeat laboratory testing to confirm that the patient continues to demonstrate hypothyroidism. Thyroid-binding globulin assists in the transport of thyroid hormone to its target tissues, and decreased concentrations may indicate thyroid-binding globulin deficiency or thyroid gland dysgenesis. Levothyroxine therapy (Choice F) may be indicated to treat congenital primary hypothyroidism. However, if repeat laboratory testing shows normal thyroid hormone concentrations, indicating transient congenital hypothyroidism, then levothyroxine would not be needed."

Torticollis refers to an abnormal contraction of the neck muscles that results in the head tilting to one side. Congenital torticollis typically presents beginning at 2 to 4 weeks of age with a preferred head position, decreased cervical range of motion, and a mass of the SCM. Hypothesized causes include birth trauma (eg, forceps delivery) or intrauterine malposition of the head, which may lead to SCM injury and consequent fibrosis and contracture of the SCM. The fibrosis may present as a mass of the SCM on physical examination. Birth trauma or intrauterine head malposition may also lead to plagiocephaly (flattening of the head). The diagnosis of congenital torticollis is clinical. Treatment requires physical therapy interventions to stretch the SCM, which leads to the resolution of torticollis in most infants.",

He is at the 50th percentile for length and 5th percentile for weight. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 145/min , respirations are 70/min , and blood pressure is 92/40 mm Hg. Examination shows prominence of the left precordium and a palpable parasternal lift. A blowing holosystolic murmur is heard best over the lower left sternal border. A chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings . Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms? A) Anomalous pulmonary blood return B) Increased peripheral vascular resistance C) Increased systemic vascular resistance D) Intermittent supraventricular tachycardia E) Left-to-right shunt Correct Answer: E. A left-to-right shunt from a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most likely explanation of this patient's cardiomegaly, increased pulmonary vascular markings, and failure to thrive. VSDs are among the most common congenital heart malformations. The genetic cause ofVSDs is heterogeneous and includes known associations with well-defined syndromes such as Down, DiGeorge, or Holt-Oram syndrome. It may also occur in isolation and via nonspecific, random mutations and individual point mutations that are de nova. VSDs are characterized by a holosystolic murmur best heard in the left lower sternal border and may have an associated palpable thrill. VSDs result in a left-to-right shunt, which increases pulmonary blood flow. This leads to remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature and resultant smooth muscle hypertrophy. In turn, concentric narrowing of the pulmonary arterioles occurs, which results in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension. If severe and progressive enough, this can cause increased right ventricular pressures and associated myocardial hypertrophy, which subsequently results in reversal of the shunt (Eisenmenger syndrome), presenting with shortness of breath and cyanosis. Increased pulmonary blood flow results in increased blood return to the left atrium, which may cause left atrial enlargement. Incorrect Answer: A, B, C, and D. Anomalous pulmonary blood return (Choice A) can be total or partial. Total anomalous pulmonary venous return is a congenital heart defect whereby oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins returns to the right atrium, not the left atrium. The presence of a second shunt is necessary to shunt blood from the right to left circulations. It does not present with a holosystolic murmur. Increased peripheral vascular resistance (Choice B), which is also known as systemic vascular resistance (Choice C), refers to increased tone within the peripheral vasculature. It is a normal response to decreased cardiac output in an attempt to maintain peripheral organ perfusion pressure. It does not explain this patient's presentation. Intermittent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) (Choice D) refers to the presence of cardiac arrhythmias that present with a rapid heart rate originating from above the ventricles (eg, multifocal atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia). ECG would likely demonstrate a narrow QRS complex with or without P waves. A holosystolic murmur is not seen in this condition and does not explain the patient's presentation. Educational Objective: VSDs are common cardiac malformations that result in a left-to-right intracardiac shunt. They may form in isolation or in conjunction with other malformations. The majority are asymptomatic and will self-resolve, but severe disease can result in pulmonary hypertension and the development of Eisenmenger syndrome, if untreated. r \" , r-- r ,",

Septic arthritis commonly occurs in children as a result of trauma to the joint permitting the translocation of cutaneous organisms (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) and may also occur in adolescents as a result of the dissemination of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a sexually transmitted bacterium that initially causes cervicitis, urethritis, or pharyngitis and may hematogenously disseminate to cause septic arthritis. Septic arthritis classically presents with a painful, erythematous, swollen joint along with systemic signs and symptoms of illness such as fever, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, and nausea. Gonococcal arthritis may present with monoarticular or asymmetric polyarticular disease and may feature adjacent tenosynovitis and dermatitis. The most common sites of gonococcal infection are the knee, ankle, wrist, and elbow, though the sternoclavicular joint may also be affected. In all causes of septic arthritis, serum laboratory values typically show leukocytosis along with increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein concentrations. Diagnosis requires arthrocentesis, which typically demonstrates purulent aspirate fluid with an increased concentration of neutrophil-predominant white blood cells. In gonococcal arthritis, culture of the aspirate fluid may disclose gram-negative diplococci. Management requires antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin along with source control.",

        "C": "Echocardiography would be helpful in diagnosing gonococcal endocarditis, a rare complication of disseminated Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. However, this patient with symptoms localized to a joint most likely has gonococcal arthritis. CT scan of the left sternoclavicular joint (Choice D) may assist in the visualization of a joint effusion. This is especially true in difficult-to-examine joints such as the hip. However, joint aspiration is the preferred method for definitively diagnosing septic arthritis. Indium-labeled leukocyte scan (Choice E), a nuclear medicine procedure that adds a radioactive tag to white blood cells, assists in localizing sites of infection and inflammation, and is often used in patients with a fever of unknown origin. This patient possesses a clear source of infection."

This patient with chronic vesicoureteral reflux and a history of recurrent pyelonephritis with new onset headache and dizziness in the setting of hypertension most likely has hypertensive urgency that has developed as a result of chronic kidney disease. Chronic vesicoureteral reflux predisposes patients to the development of recurrent pyelonephritis as urine from the bladder travels in a retrograde fashion to the kidneys. Recurrent pyelonephritis can lead to scarring of the renal parenchyma and loss of nephron mass, which decreases the glomerular filtration rate, and can lead to chronic kidney disease. Hypertension is a common complication of chronic renal disease and results primarily from impaired handling of sodium leading to expansion of the intravascular volume and subsequent systolic hypertension. Over time, chronic vascular remodeling and increased systemic vascular resistance lead to an increase in diastolic blood pressure. Assessment of the serum urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations is an appropriate first step in assessing kidney function. Increases in both are suggestive of kidney injury. Further assessment of urinary protein excretion is also appropriate.",

Hypothyroidism is more commonly associated with hypertension than hyperthyroidism, but patients also typically present with weight gain, constipation, fatigue, and cold intolerance.

Hyperstimulation of the TSH receptor leads to overproduction of thyroid hormone and a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland on physical examination, along with signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism including weight loss, insomnia, palpitations, heat intolerance, warm skin, tremor, diaphoresis, and pretibial myxedema. TSH-receptor-stimulating antibodies also stimulate orbital fibroblasts and lead to thyroid ophthalmopathy, which is characterized by the expansion of orbital fat and connective tissue with resultant exophthalmos, lid lag, and restrictive strabismus. Thyroid ophthalmopathy may lead to diplopia, corneal exposure, compressive optic neuropathy, and a cosmetic appearance that is distressing for patients. Thyroid laboratory studies typically demonstrate primary hyperthyroidism with increased thyroxine and triiodothyronine, and decreased TSH. Radioactive iodine uptake nuclear scintigraphy typically demonstrates diffuse, abnormally increased uptake of the thyroid gland without a discrete nodule. Graves disease is treated with antithyroid drugs such as methimazole and propylthiouracil, and radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid gland. Thyroid ophthalmopathy typically responds well to topical lubrication, although severe cases may require intravenous corticosteroids and a staged surgical approach.",

Lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland (Choice B) is characteristic of Hashimoto disease. While patients with Hashimoto disease may present with transient symptoms of hyperthyroidism during the acute stage, patients progress to develop signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, including fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, hyporeflexia, myxedema, and dry, cool skin. Hashimoto disease does not cause orbital findings of exophthalmos and lid lag. Malignant infiltration of the thyroid gland (Choice C) may lead to symptoms of hyperthyroidism through the destruction of thyroid follicular cells with resultant release of thyroid hormone, though patients are generally euthyroid. This mechanism would not cause orbital findings of exophthalmos and lid lag.

Initial, universal steps after delivery include an assessment of the newborn's heart and respiratory rates, muscle tone, reflexes, and color, and immediate warming, drying, and tactile stimulation, all of which are helpful for stimulating spontaneous respirations. Neonates who fail to respond to gentle tactile stimulation should be immediately supported with more invasive support techniques, such as bag and mask ventilation or endotracheal intubation. Tactile stimulation and oxygen therapy are noninvasive and are therefore an appropriate initial step.",

These neoplasms present as red or purple subcutaneous tumors. The increased blood flow may cause the affected area to be warm and swollen or even cause a limb length discrepancy. Signs of other hemangiomas, such as a bruit over the liver, may also be present. The large, convoluted vascular architecture causes platelet adhesion and trapping. This trapping leads to consumption offibrinogen and ongoing fibrinolysis, causing a consumptive coagulopathy. Patients present, as in this case, with mucocutaneous bleeding (bruising and petechiae), which could not be explained by trauma. They also demonstrate thrombocytopenia on laboratory evaluation. Treatment includes supportive measures to maintain hemostasis and treatment of the underlying vascular neoplasm.",

        "A": "Cutaneous lymphoma has a variety of presentations. It is rare in children, particularly in newborns. The most common type of cutaneous lymphoma is mycosis fungoides, an indolent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Mycosis fungoides presents with scaly, wrinkled patches in sun-protected areas, more often in adults than children. Cystic hygroma (Choice B) and lymphangioma (Choice E) are both lymphatic malformations. Cystic hygroma may be seen in association with Turner syndrome as a subcutaneous mass of the neck. However, neither of these are associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome or the development of thrombocytopenia. Juvenile xanthogranuloma (Choice D) is an uncommon benign proliferation of histiocytes. It clinically appears as a solitary orange-pink papule on the face, neck, or trunk of a child. It is not a vascular neoplasm and does not cause Kasabach-Merritt syndrome.",
        "F": "Mastocytoma is a benign proliferation of mast cells in the skin. The typical presentation is a single, orange-brown, leathery plaque, which forms a wheal upon scratching. Mastocytosis may also have presentations without cutaneous findings. Rapid mast cell degranulation may cause anaphylaxis but does not contribute to thrombocytopenia.",

The patches of alopecia may demonstrate black dots that represent broken hairs. When a significant inflammatory response to the fungal infection occurs, a kerion develops. A kerion is a boggy and swollen lesion on examination. Tinea capitis is caused by dermatophytes including Trichophyton rubrum, Epidermophyton floccosum, and Microsporum canis. First-line treatment of tinea capitis is with an oral antifungal, usually griseofulvin or terbinafine. Close contacts of patients should be examined as the condition is contagious and can be spread through fomites, such as shared combs, pillows, or hats.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Topical corticosteroid therapy will worsen tinea capitis by inhibiting the inflammatory response necessary to eliminate the infection. Superficial dermatophyte infections treated with topical corticosteroids may become more severe. Tinea treated with topical corticosteroids is often referred to as tinea incognito, because of the severe and unusual morphologies that these infections take on after treatment with topical corticosteroids. Tinea capitis is a fungal infection, not a bacterial infection, and thus oral antibacterial therapy (Choice B) is unnecessary. Tinea capitis and kerion may become secondarily colonized with skin flora, such as S. aureus, in which case antibiotics may be necessary, but this is atypical. Oral antibacterial therapy is appropriate for bacterial skin infections including cellulitis, erysipelas, and severe folliculitis. Surgical excision (Choice D) is unnecessary as the infection can be treated with oral antifungals. In children, dermatologic surgical excision is generally reserved for neoplastic processes. No intervention necessary (Choice E) is not the standard of care for tinea capitis. Without appropriate antifungal treatment, the infection and inflammatory response will worsen. Inadequate treatment puts the patient's close contacts at risk for developing the infection as well."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Neonatal sepsis is categorized often on the basis of time from parturition, since the period of time in which symptoms begin may indicate which pathogen is likely involved, thereby guiding therapy. Early-onset neonatal sepsis (within 72 hours of birth) is marked by symptoms of lethargy, seizures, poor feeding, weak cry, and hypotonia. It presents with tachycardia, tachypnea, occasionally fever, and often with an examination that is nonfocal. If examination findings are present, they may reflect the source of infection or may reflect complications of sepsis such as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Early-onset neonatal sepsis generally occurs as a result of pathogens acquired from the mother, either through hematogenous or transplacental spread or, commonly, contact acquisition in the birth canal. The most common pathogens associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis include Streptococcus agalactiae (group B), Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Listeria monocytogenes. Syndromes of serious bacterial infection include bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia. Late-onset neonatal sepsis (presenting 72 hours or more after birth) more commonly occurs from environmental pathogens in addition to those acquired from the mother. Pneumonia is more common in early-onset sepsis, and presents with cough, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia, increased work of breathing, and rhonchi on auscultation. Workup for any suspected case of sepsis in a child younger than 30 days of age is broad, and should include a complete blood count, urinalysis, blood cultures, chest x-ray, and lumbar puncture at a minimum, since symptoms in this population are vague and nonspecific, limiting the utility of the history and physical examination to guide workup. X-rays in neonatal pneumonia disclose focal or diffuse airspace disease or may show diffuse interstitial infiltrates suggestive of respiratory distress syndrome. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover the common pathogens.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "B": "Meconium aspiration occurs when the fetus inhales meconium into the lungs and is a known complication of labor and delivery. It presents with signs of respiratory distress (eg, cough, tachypnea, hypoxia, use of accessory muscles of respiration) and severity is a function of the volume of meconium aspirated. It is generally self-resolving when occurring in small amounts; large aspirations can lead to pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis. Pneumococcal meningitis (Choice C) most commonly occurs in adults, whereas common pathogens causing meningitis in the neonate include Streptococcus agalactiae (group B), E. coli, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and L monocytogenes. Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly P. carini1) pneumonia (Choice D) generally occurs in immunocompromised persons and was seen commonly in individuals with advanced HIV prior to the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Patients classically present with cough, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia, with rhonchi on lung auscultation and prominent perihilar and multifocal infiltrates on chest x-ray. It would be rare in a neonate. Respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia (Choice E) is one of the most common causes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 2 years of age. In the neonatal period, bacterial infection is more common and is also more consistent with bandemia and diffuse infiltrates on x-ray."

It classically presents in children with bloody diarrhea accompanied by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. Other pathogenic precipitants include S. pneumoniae, Salmonella species, and Shigel/a species infections. This patient presents following several days of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, suggesting a bacterial or viral trigger. The abrupt change of pallor and lethargy, along with red urine and falling urine output suggests the presence of both anemia and renal failure. Physical examination may show petechiae, purpura, or ecchymosis, all of which are signs of thrombocytopenia. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates thrombocytopenia, increased creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentrations, and often multiple electrolyte derangements depending on the extent of volume depletion and acute renal failure. Treatment is supportive and may include plasma exchange; many cases self-resolve. Generally, platelet transfusion is contraindicated because of the risk for worsening the degree of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia since platelet administration has been postulated to worsen the degree of thrombosis.

Henoch-Schonlein nephritis (Choice C) is a vasculitis that classically presents in a child with renal failure and palpable purpura on the lower extremities following an upper respiratory infection. Patients often complain of arthralgias and abdominal pain, and intussusception is a known complication. Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (Choice D) is a nephritic syndrome presenting with gross or microscopic hematuria, peripheral or periorbital edema, and hypertension in a child, typically two weeks after infection with group A ~-hemolytic streptococci.

Henoch-Schonlein nephritis (Choice C) is a vasculitis that classically presents in a child with renal failure and palpable purpura on the lower extremities following an upper respiratory infection. Patients often complain of arthralgias and abdominal pain, and intussusception is a known complication. Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (Choice D) is a nephritic syndrome presenting with gross or microscopic hematuria, peripheral or periorbital edema, and hypertension in a child, typically two weeks after infection with group A ~-hemolytic streptococci. Laboratory evaluation may show low serum C3 concentrations and positive anti-streptolysin O and anti-DNase titers. Systemic vasculitis (Choice E) describes a broad class of diseases that encompass small, medium, and large arterial inflammation affecting various organ systems, commonly the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and lung. While vasculitides may present following illness, the classic triad of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure makes HUS a more likely diagnosis. Educational Objective: HUS is typically associated with infection from enterohemorrhagic E.coli O157:H? as a result of the production of Shiga toxin. It classically presents in children with bloody diarrhea accompanied by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 24 of 50 24 . A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination . He is active and has been healthy except for an episode of otitis media 3 weeks ago treated with amoxicillin. His parents emigrated from Vietnam . His diet consists mainly of fruits and vegetables ; he occasionally eats fish and chicken but no red meat. Examination shows no abnormalities . Laboratory studies show : Hemoglobin 10 g/dL Mean corpuscular volume 64 µm 3 Leukocyte count 6100/mm 3 Platelet count 225 ,000/mm 3 Red cell distribution width 10% (N=13%-15%) A blood smear is shown . Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's anemia? A) Antibiotic-induced autoimmune hemolysis B) Iron deficiency C Thalassemia mino D) Transient postinfectious bone marrow suppression E) Vitamin B (cobalamin) deficiency 12 Correct Answer: B. This asymptomatic child with mild anemia, microcytosis, and low red cell distribution width (RDW) who is of southeast Asian heritage most likely has either a- or ~-thalassemia minor. Thalassemia is characterized by the decreased synthesis of globin chains. Normal adult hemoglobin is known as HbA (a~2l and is composed of two a-globin chains and two ~-globin chains. There are four a-globin alleles and two ~-globin alleles. Mutations in one or two a-globin alleles or one ~-globin allele causes thalassemia minor. Thalassemia trait is common in southeast Asia and commonly presents with mild microcytic anemia. Supportive features include the presence of target cells on peripheral blood smear (pictured in the photomicrograph), a low RDW (which indicates that most erythrocytes are of the same size with little variation), and persistence of microcytosis. Iron concentrations can be measured to rule out iron deficiency. Other cell lines including platelets and white blood cells should be within normal ranges. Hemoglobin electrophoresis can be used to distinguish between a- and ~-thalassemia minor. There is no treatment required for thalassemia minor as the resultant anemia is usually not severe. lncorrectAnswers:A, C, D, and E. Antibiotic-induced autoimmune hemolysis (Choice A) can occur after exposure to penicillins and cephalosporins, but the onset is typically acute and occurs within hours to days. While hemolysis can occur weeks later, it is less common. Additionally, patients would be expected to present with normocytic anemia and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Haptoglobin concentrations can be measured and will be low, while the reticulocyte count will typically be increased. Iron deficiency (Choice C) is a common cause of anemia in menstruating women, strict vegans or vegetarians, and those with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding or celiac disease. It commonly presents with microcytosis, although often with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) that is higher than what is seen in thalassemia, and an increased RDW indicating the release of premature erythrocytes from the bone marrow. The measurement of serum iron and ferritin, which will be low, are used to make the diagnosis. Transient postinfectious bone marrow suppression (Choice D) may occur following viral infections, but more commonly presents with leukopenia, which is not present in this case. In patients with sickle cell disease, infection with parvovirus B19 can cause a transient aplastic crisis and severe anemia. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 24 of 50 B) Iron deficiency C) Thalassemia mino D) Transient postinfectious bone marrow suppression E) Vitamin B (cobalamin) deficiency 12 Correct Answer: B.

In patients with sickle cell disease, infection with parvovirus B19 can cause a transient aplastic crisis and severe anemia. Vitamin B (cobalamin) deficiency (Choice E) results in megaloblastic anemia, which presents with macrocytosis and hypersegmented neutrophils. It 12 is more common in patients who chronically abuse alcohol, or in patients with a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, Crohn disease, or malabsorptive disorders. This patient demonstrates a microcytic anemia. Educational Objective: Thalassemia minor can occur as a result of mutations or deletions in one of the ~-globin alleles or in one or two of the a-globin alleles, leading to the impaired production of globin chains. Patients typically demonstrate a mild microcytic anemia with a low RDW and normal concentrations of leukocytes and platelets. Hemoglobin electrophoresis can be used to distinguish between these two entities. Treatment is often not necessary. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 25 of 50 'I",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "An ECG should be obtained in this patient with unexplained exertional syncope. There are several high-risk cardiac conditions that can present with syncope in pediatric patients, and these can be classified as structural defects, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery anomalies, or valvular aortic stenosis, or can be a result of electrical abnormalities, such as long QT syndrome or Brugada syndrome. Evaluation with ECG is mandatory in all patients with unexplained syncope. Of these, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is one of the more common causes of syncope. It is generally inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and may be the cause of death in this patient's cousin. Syncope occurs as a result of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction with a consequent decrease in cardiac output leading to decreased cerebral perfusion and syncope. Decreased perfusion of the coronary arteries can cause angina and increase the risk for ventricular arrhythmias, although this is not always seen. ECG classically demonstrates left ventricular hypertrophy with non-specific T wave abnormalities in the precordial leads. Deep, narrow, symmetric Q waves may also be seen in the lateral and inferior leads. Echocardiography should be subsequently performed to evaluate the underlying cardiac anatomy, which would allow for assessment of the degree of LVOT obstruction, if present.",
      "distractor_explanations": {
        "A": "Reassurance is inappropriate. Patients with unexplained exertional syncope are at a high-risk for sudden cardiac death. ECG is a low-cost and noninvasive means of assessing for underlying cardiac defects and should be performed as soon as possible. Chest x-ray (Choice B) could be considered in patients with exertional shortness of breath, wheezing, or a prodrome suggestive of bacterial pneumonia, but this patient's presentation is more consistent with a cardiac cause of syncope. EEG (Choice D) is not necessary as this patient's syncopal episode was not associated with classic seizure-like activity. Often, seizures that result in syncope are preceded by an aura, and patients are typically confused upon waking, which is known as a postictal state. The patient's history is not consistent with a seizure. Convulsions can also be seen during syncope. Admission to the hospital for observation (Choice E) is not necessary. Had the patient not regained consciousness or required cardiopulmonary resuscitation, admission to the hospital would be appropriate. This patient should be advised not to participate in exercise until a complete evaluation has been undertaken, but this can be performed in the outpatient setting."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Patellofemoral instability is a common cause of anterior knee pain, which is caused by an anatomical defect leading to excessive movement of the patella. It is exacerbated by overuse and activities that put weight on a flexed knee, such as running and jumping. On examination, passive movement of the patella demonstrates increased sliding of the patella in either the lateral axis or superior-inferior axis. The patella may also be tender to palpation. The mainstay of treatment for patellar instability is activity modification and physical therapy. The goal of physical therapy is to strengthen the surrounding muscles and recruit stability of the patella from these muscles, as well as improve the position and balance of the limb overall. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be prescribed for use as needed.",

        "B": "Dermatomyositis is an autoimmune connective tissue disease that causes pink papules over the dorsal fingers (Gottron papules), pink to light purple patches over the upper eyelids (heliotrope sign), light pink to lilac colored patches with telangiectasias on the upper back and sun-exposed chest, dilated capillaries with dropout on the proximal nail folds, and proximal muscle weakness. Growing pains (Choice C) are recurrent, self-limited pains in the extremities that occur during childhood and early adolescence. Physical examination is normal. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (Choice D), or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, is characterized by fever, arthritis, an evanescent salmon-colored rash, and lymphadenopathy. Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (Choice E) is an idiopathic avascular necrosis of the femoral head, which often presents in young males. The classic presentation includes a slow onset of hip pain that is worsened by activity and associated with a limp. The pain may or may not be relieved with rest. Neuroblastoma with bone marrow metastases (Choice F) is a malignancy of neuroendocrine cells associated with the sympathetic nervous tissue. Bone marrow metastases classically cause pain at night, and the patient would likely appear ill and cachectic. Septic arthritis (Choice H) results from a bacterial infection of the synovial joint space, most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus. The affected joint demonstrates pain, swelling, and erythema. Arthrocentesis is indicated for the evaluation of monoarticular erythema and swelling to evaluate for septic arthritis, which characteristically discloses purulent synovial fluid with >50,000 leukocytes/mm"

In this case, a lactic acidosis secondary to inadequate perfusion of organs and forced anaerobic metabolism is likely the cause of the metabolic acidosis as a result of hypoxemia. If functioning correctly, the respiratory system compensates for the acidosis by increasing minute ventilation, which eliminates carbon dioxide, an acid. This results in a decreased pCO and an increased pH to approximately normal range. This patient's increased pCO suggests that respiratory 2 2 compensation is not only inadequate but that there is also a concomitant respiratory acidosis. The Winters formula is used to determine the range of pCO if compensation is adequate: 1.5(HCO + 8 +/- 2. In this ·) 2 3 case, the range of pCO2o if adequately compensated, would be 27 to 31 mmHg.

Breath-holding episodes are common paroxysmal events between the ages of 6 months to 6 years, typically triggered by stress-induced autonomic dysfunction. The typical sequence of events is crying, followed by breath-holding and cyanosis, then muscle rigidity and shaking, and finally limpness and loss of consciousness. Episodes may recur daily.

The first Pap smear is recommended at age 21 years (Choice D). By age 21, many patients have initiated sexual activity and may already be infected with HPV. HPV infection typically occurs years before concerning cervical lesions may be detected by Pap smear."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cardiac output is most likely to be increased in this patient with severe anemia secondary to sickle cell disease (SCD). Adequate oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues occurs in several steps: oxygenation of the lung alveoli, binding of oxygen to hemoglobin in erythrocytes, and delivery of oxygenated erythrocytes to peripheral tissues with an adequate cardiac output. Peripheral oxygen delivery is mathematically defined by the product of the cardiac output and the arterial oxygen content. Arterial oxygen content is significantly lower in the setting of severe anemia, as in this patient, because there is a substantially lower hemoglobin content. As such, cardiac output must increase to accommodate a substantially lower arterial oxygen content if oxygen delivery to the peripheral tissues is to remain the same. This phenomenon accounts for the patient's active precordium and grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur. Additionally, this patient likely suffers from a component of sepsis given his persistent upper respiratory tract infection and fever, which would increase the patient's risk for concomitant septic shock. In the early stages of septic shock, the cardiac output is also increased in an attempt to maintain mean arterial pressure.",

CVP is often used as a surrogate for preload and correlates with the volume of the right atrium, provided the pulmonary artery pressure is normal. Peripheral tissue oxygenation (Choice C) will either remain the same or decrease further if the patient's cardiac output cannot maintain its increased state and/or the hemoglobin concentration further decreases. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (Choice D) is likely to be normal or low because of the patient's hypovolemia. In older patients with SCD, chronic high-output cardiac states can lead to pulmonary hypertension and increase the PVR. Systemic afterload (Choice E) is likely low or normal in this patient with components of both hypovolemic and septic shock. The patient presents with a severe anemia and evidence of hypovolemia on examination, which would typically result in an increased systemic vascular resistance in an attempt to maintain mean arterial pressure. This patient also presents with a persistent infection and fever, which may indicate a component of concomitant septic shock, which would result in a low systemic vascular resistance from cytokine-mediated arterial vasodilation."

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Complement system immunodeficiency is the most likely diagnosis in this patient with meningococcemia. Late component complement deficiency (CS to C9) is a common finding in patients who have recurrent infections with Neisseria species, and increases susceptibility to this pathogen through failure to form the membrane attack complex (MAC). Complement activation can occur through the classical, lectin, or alternative pathways, with each pathway converging at the point where C3 is cleaved by C3 convertase, releasing C3a and C3b. Following this, C3b is incorporated into the C3 convertase complex, which subsequently acts on CS convertase to lower the Km (increase the affinity) of CS convertase for its substrate, CS. Cleavage of CS results in the formation of C5a, a potent chemoattractant, and C5b. C5b complexes with C6, C7, CB, and C9 (terminal complement factors) to form the MAC, which allows for the creation of a transmembrane pore that interferes with the integrity of the cellular membrane, leading to cell lysis. Deficiencies of terminal complement factors impair the formation of the MAC and preferentially predispose patients to infection with Neisseria species. While most patients experience mild infection with atypical serotypes, they can also develop fulminant meningococcemia from typical Neisseria serotypes, as in this patient. lncorrectAnswers:A, B, D, E, and F. AIDS (Choice A) can develop in pediatric patients who have acquired the infection vertically during the perinatal period from a mother with untreated HIV infection. Most patients present with evidence of recurrent pneumonia, infection with atypical organisms such as Mycobacterium avium, or with opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia. It commonly presents within months of birth but can also develop many years after birth. Child abuse (Choice B) should be suspected in cases where bruising is located in atypical locations such as the back or is with an atypical appearance, such as a linear mark on the upper arm. Purpura on the trunk and extremities is classic for meningococcemia and is far more likely in this patient with sepsis and a family history of meningococcemia. Congenital humoral system immunodeficiency (Choice D) is caused by numerous syndromes, including X-linked agammaglobulinemia, whereby B lymphocyte development is impaired by mutations in the BTK gene. Low or absent immunoglobulin secretion increases the risk for recurrent bacterial infections, but patients present within the first eighteen months of life. Increased susceptibility to Neisseria species, in particular, is not characteristic of this disease. Frequent exposure to multiple pathogens (Choice E) is incorrect. Healthy children are exposed to numerous pathogens on a daily basis and most do not develop invasive bacterial infections. While Neisseria meningitidis is associated with outbreaks in college dorms and military barracks, there is no such history in this case. Vitamin A deficiency (Choice F) is classically associated with xerophthalmia but does not cause the findings described in this patient. Educational Objective: Deficiency of the terminal complement proteins prevents the formation of the MAC, which is a critical component in the complement cascade, typically leading to the formation of a pore in the membrane of pathogenic organisms. Deficiency predisposes to recurrent and invasive infections with Neisseria species. r \" , r-- r , Exam Section : Item 38 of 50 'I",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Intussusception occurs when a segment of bowel telescopes into an adjacent segment, resulting in colicky abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and potential bloody, mucoid stools. Classically, it presents in an infant or young child with recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain often punctuated by asymptomatic periods. Intussusception typically occurs due to the presence of a pathologic lead point, often lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphadenopathy, Meckel diverticulum, stricture, or malignancy, which acts to draw one segment of bowel into an adjacent segment during peristalsis. If the intussusception self-resolves, there may be no symptoms. If it does not resolve, traction on mesenteric vessels can result in hypoperfusion of the segment with resultant inflammation, hemorrhage, obstruction, and pain. It may be detected on physical examination as an elongated mass, often in the right upper quadrant. Diagnosis consists of clinical history, physical examination, and is supported by imaging. Ultrasound evaluation is preferred in young children and will show telescoping interposed bowel segments in longitudinal orientation, or a targetoid appearance in transverse orientation. A contrast enema can also demonstrate intussusception with appearance of a mass prolapsing into the lumen and an inability of the contrast to reach the proximal bowel. Treatment of an ileocolic intussusception requires the administration of a contrast enema, which reduces the intussusception. Contrast enema is both diagnostic and therapeutic in this setting. Surgery may be required in cases where there is repetitive failure of the enema to reduce the intussusception or if the patient presents with symptoms concerning for bowel necrosis or perforation. , q (> ¢@  © € € @",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This neonate presents with findings consistent with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV, also known as human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), belongs to the family of herpesviruses, and possesses a large, double-stranded DNA genome. Congenital CMV infection presents with intrauterine growth restriction, microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, hearing loss, seizures, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and petechial rash. The diagnosis is confirmed with viral culture or polymerase chain amplification from urine or blood within the first week of life. It is the most common cause of nonhereditary sensorineural hearing loss. In about 10% of cases, hearing loss may be an isolated finding without other symptoms of infection present. Hearing loss is also the most common sequela of an initially asymptomatic neonate. Fetal hydrops is a potential complication of CMV infection, although it is less common than with parvovirus B19 infection. Intracranial calcifications demonstrate a characteristic periventricular distribution and may be detected by ultrasonography or computed tomography. Pregnant women most often contract CMV through exposure from young children, often through daycare centers. A primary maternal infection has a high risk for vertical transmission via the placenta to the fetus. Treatment is with antiviral agents, such as ganciclovir or valganciclovir.",

SS and TEN are distinguished from each other based on the amount of body surface area involvement (<10% for SJS and >30% for TEN) and are driven by the same underlying pathophysiology. Common drugs implicated in the development of SJS or TEN include beta-lactam antibiotics, antiepileptics, sulfa- containing medications including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and allopurinol. SS and TEN are characterized by confluent areas of dusky erythema with desquamation of the epidermis. It can be distinguished from a morbilliform drug eruption by the presence of skin pain, desquamation, and mucosal involvement. SJS and TEN are often complicated by infection of the denuded areas of skin, thus meticulous wound care, preferably in a burn unit, is critical. The first step in treatment is to identify and discontinue the offending agents. Supportive care in a burn intensive care unit setting has been shown to improve mortality, but the role of other agents including systemic steroids, cyclosporine, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are controversial.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This newborn presents with findings consistent with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV, also known as human herpesvirus 5, belongs to the family of herpesviruses, and possesses a large, double-stranded DNA genome. Pregnant women most often contract CMV through exposure from young children, often through daycare centers. A primary maternal infection has a high risk for vertical transmission via the placenta to the fetus. Congenital CMV infection presents with intrauterine growth restriction, microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, hearing loss, seizures, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and petechial rash. Congenital CMV infection is the most common cause of nonhereditary sensorineural hearing loss. In about 10% of cases, hearing loss may be an isolated finding without other symptoms of infection present. Hearing loss is also the most common sequela of an initially asymptomatic newborn. Fetal hydrops is a potential complication of CMV infection, although less common than in the setting of congenital parvovirus B19 infection. Intracranial calcifications have a characteristic periventricular distribution and may be detected by ultrasonography or CT scan. The diagnosis is confirmed with viral culture or polymerase chain amplification from urine or blood within the first week of life. Treatment is with antiviral agents such as ganciclovir or valganciclovir.",

Causative agents include viral or bacterial pathogens, commonly Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae. It presents with ear pain, often with fever, an erythematous tympanic membrane with retrotympanic pus or a middle ear effusion, and conductive hearing loss. The middle ear is bounded externally by the tympanic membrane and internally by the oval window. It is connected to the nasopharynx via the eustachian (auditory) tubes, which open into the posterior nasopharynx near the torus tubarius. Infection usually spreads to the middle ear by way of the eustachian tubes. First-line therapy includes antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin with or without clavulanate, as well as symptomatic treatment. Recurrent episodes may lead to inflammation of the adjacent mastoid bone, a condition known as mastoiditis. Features of mastoiditis include those of otitis media, plus opacification of mastoid air cells on CT scan and deviation of the ear. Children with recurrent episodes of acute otitis media may benefit from surgical drainage with myringotomy and tympanostomy tube placement. er @ ° : . G cal © 7  &",

This abnormal chloride transport causes decreased chloride and water secretion and increased water reabsorption, leading to abnormally viscous mucous. The thick mucus in the gastrointestinal tract contributes to pancreatic insufficiency, steatorrhea, and malabsorption, leading to a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. In the lungs, the disease manifests as recurrent pneumonia, especially with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Repeat antibiotic exposure increases the risk for colonization with resistant organisms. Obstruction and destruction of the airways leads to hypoxemia, air trapping, and bronchiectasis. Physical examination may show hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (clubbing), cyanosis, rales and rhonchi, and hyperresonance to percussion of the chest.

Primary dysmenorrhea typically presents with pain in the lower abdomen and pelvis, which may radiate to the lower back or thighs. It is often accompanied by nausea, diarrhea, headaches, and flushing. Symptoms typically begin in adolescence. It can be attributed to uterine vasoconstriction in response to an excess of prostaglandin.

It is inherited in an X-linked, recessive pattern and results in defective intracellular killing of catalase-positive pathogens because NADPH oxidase is a necessary enzyme in producing the respiratory/oxidative burst. The impaired leukocyte microbicidal activity makes patients susceptible to recurrent pyogenic bacterial and fungal infections with organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Aspergillus species, and Candida species. Symptoms often appear within the first few years of life with recurrent pneumonia, lung abscesses, aspergillosis infection, skin abscesses, osteomyelitis, and chronic diarrhea. Physical examination may show hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Diagnosis is made by an abnormal dihydrorhodamine test or a nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test.

DKA occurs most commonly in the setting of type 1 diabetes mellitus and may be the initial presentation in a patient who has not yet been diagnosed. It is caused by accumulation of serum ketones such as beta-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone in the setting of insulin deficiency or acute catabolic stressors such as infection. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs because of the relative state of starvation created by absent insulin signaling. Patients with DKA may present with fatigue, polyuria, polydipsia, shortness of breath or tachypnea, and diffuse abdominal discomfort. Vital signs may show tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension due to severe hypovolemia, which occurs secondary to osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia. Kussmaul respiration, a rapid and deep breathing pattern, is a classic physical examination finding due to respiratory compensation for the underlying metabolic acidosis. Patients may demonstrate physical examination signs of hypovolemia (eg, dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor) along with a sweet breath odor secondary to ketones. Laboratory analysis typically show increased serum glucose and ketones, metabolic acidosis, and a high anion-gap due to the accumulation of unmeasured anions in serum. A metabolic acidosis is accompanied by a decreased bicarbonate concentration in the serum, as bicarbonate is consumed in the neutralization of increased acidic molecules (hydrogen ions) in the blood. The initial management of DKA should focus on volume repletion with isotonic fluids, which is crucial to hemodynamically stabilize the patient, restore tissue perfusion, and clear ketones. Volume repletion should be followed by insulin, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions. ; q (> ¢@  © € € @",

Metabolic alkalosis occurs secondary to dehydration and subsequent volume contraction plus relative excess of bicarbonate.

The genetic cause of VSDs is heterogeneous and includes known associations with well-defined syndromes such as thymic aplasia (DiGeorge), Down, or Holt-Oram syndrome. It may also occur in isolation and via nonspecific, random mutations and individual point mutations that are de novo. VSDs are characterized by a holosystolic murmur best heard in the left lower sternal border and may have an associated palpable thrill. VSDs result in a left to right shunt, which increases pulmonary blood flow. This leads to remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature and resultant smooth muscle hypertrophy. In turn, concentric narrowing of the pulmonary arterioles occurs, which results in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension. If severe and progressive enough, this can cause increased right ventricular pressures and associated myocardial hypertrophy, which can be associated with a narrowly split Sp, because of the timing of closing of the pulmonary valve, right ventricular heave, and signs of right heart failure, such as lower extremity edema and hepatomegaly.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient with an erythematous, swollen, and painful knee with associated decreased range of motion has a presentation consistent with septic arthritis. Septic arthritis results from a bacterial infection of the synovial joint space, most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus, and classically presents with joint pain, worse with loading, ranging, and use, swelling, and overlying erythema. Children, inmunocompromised patients, those with a history of traumatic injury to the joint, and those with existing abnormal joint anatomy (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, gout) may be more commonly affected. The mechanism of infection may be direct inoculation, hematogenous spread, or extension from a neighboring local infection (eg, osteomyelitis). Vital signs may show fever and tachycardia. Physical examination classically shows an erythematous, edematous joint with a palpable effusion, and tenderness elicited on range of motion or palpation. If direct ttauma preceded the infection, a wound or laceration may be present in association with the joint findings. Laboratory analysis typically shows leukocytosis, along with increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein concentrations. Arthrocentesis is essential to diagnose septic arthritis, and to differentiate the condition from osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthropathies, such as gout and rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial fluid can also be sent for culture and Gram stain plus sensitivity testing of offending organisms, permitting targeted treatment. The leukocyte count in synovial fluid is generally greater than 50,000/mm and predominantly neutrophilic when the infectious agent is bacterial, as in this patient.

Germ cell tumors comprise most testicular cancer and include seminoma, choriocarcinoma, teratoma, yolk sac tumor, and embryonal carcinoma. Non-germ cell tumors are often sex cord-gonadal stromal tumors originating from Sertoli or Leydig cells. Risk factors for the development of germ cell tumors include cryptorchidism, family history, seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome), and heavy marijuana use.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Intussusception occurs when a segment of bowel telescopes into an adjacent segment, resulting in colicky abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and potentially bloody, mucoid stools. Classically, it presents in an infant or young child with recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain often punctuated by asymptomatic periods. Intussusception typically occurs because of the presence of a pathologic lead point, often lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphadenopathy, Meckel diverticulum, stricture, or malignancy, which acts to draw one segment of bowel into an adjacent segment during peristalsis. If the intussusception self-resolves, there may be no symptoms. If it does not resolve, traction on mesenteric vessels can result in hypoperfusion of the segment with resultant inflammation, hemorrhage, obstruction, and pain. It may be detected on physical examination as an elongated mass, often in the right upper quadrant. Diagnosis consists of clinical history and physical examination and is supported by imaging. Ultrasound evaluation is preferred in young children and will show telescoping interposed bowel segments in longitudinal orientation, or a targetoid appearance in transverse orientation. A contrast enema can also show intussusception with appearance of a mass prolapsing into the lumen and an inability of the contrast to reach the proximal bowel. Treatment of an ileocolic intussusception requires the administration of a contrast enema, which reduces the intussusception. Contrast enema is both diagnostic and therapeutic in this setting. Surgery may be required in cases where there is repetitive failure of the enema to reduce the intussusception or if the patient has symptoms concerning for bowel necrosis or perforation. < q (> ¢@  © € € @",

It is inherited in a sporadic pattern and may result from mutations or deletions in the paternal alleles, errors in the genetic imprinting of these alleles, or their complete absence in the case of maternal uniparental disomy. The syndrome has several characteristic features. Hypotonia is common and can lead to abnormal uterine position of the fetus and complicated labor, as well as feeding difficulties and failure to thrive in infancy. Developmental delays, intellectual disability, and disruptive behavioral patterns are commonly observed. It is associated with growth hormone deficiency and short stature. Hyperphagia and obesity are also hallmark manifestations of Prader-Willi syndrome. Individuals tend to have distinct facies with almond-shaped eyes, strabismus, and a wide, flattened nasal bridge.

Abnormal valve architecture can also present a nidus for infection; hence, patients are at increased risk for bacterial endocarditis. There is also a small risk for systemic thromboembolic disease from clots that form on the valve.

Most cases follow a cyclic pattern that reoccurs every 21 days and typically lasts for 3 to 6 days. Classic symptoms include fever, malaise, and ulcers affecting the oral mucous membranes. Some patients may also develop pharyngitis and chronic periodontal disease that can result in early tooth loss. During episodes of neutropenia, patients are at increased risk for bacterial infections that may involve the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, or skin. The pathophysiology is not well understood, however, the disease is associated with mutations in the gene encoding neutrophil elastase. The diagnosis can be confirmed by monitoring a patient's neutrophil count several times weekly for at least 6 weeks. Genetic testing for mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene is also recommended. Acute management involves treatment of the current infection with appropriate therapies and maintaining good oral/dental hygiene. Long-term therapy with human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor is effective in keeping neutrophils at normal concentrations in the blood.",

A primary maternal infection has a high risk for vertical transmission via the placenta to the fetus. Congenital CMV infection presents with intrauterine growth restriction, microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, hearing loss, seizures, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and petechial rash. Congenital CMV infection is the most common cause of nonhereditary sensorineural hearing loss. In about 10% of cases, hearing loss may be an isolated finding without other symptoms of infection present. Hearing loss is also the most common sequela of an initially asymptomatic newborn. Fetal hydrops is a potential complication of CMV infection, although less common than in the setting of congenital parvovirus B19 infection. Intracranial calcifications have a characteristic periventricular distribution and may be detected by ultrasonography or CT scan. The diagnosis is confirmed with viral culture or polymerase chain amplification from urine or blood within the first week of life.

Tetralogy of Fallot consists of pulmonary infundibular stenosis, overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect (VSD), and right ventricular hypertrophy, resulting in a right- to-left shunt with cyanosis first noted in infancy. Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction eventually leads to right ventricular hypertrophy. The murmur heard with Tetralogy of Fallot, which is typically a holosystolic murmur best heard in the left lower sternal border, is caused by RVOT obstruction, not as often by the VSD. Paroxysmal cyanosis that occurs during periods of crying is a classic presentation and these episodes are referred to as “tet” spells. Patients during one of these spells often exhibit rapid, deep breathing, agitation, and progressive cyanosis. These periods of cyanosis occur as a result of transient obstruction or occlusion of the RVOT leading to decreased blood flow through the pulmonary circulation, although the cause of the underlying transient obstruction is unclear. Treatment of tetralogy of Fallot is with surgical correction. Surgery aims to relieve the RVOT obstruction, close the VSD, and separate the pulmonary and systemic circulation.

It can also be divided into physiologic and pathologic forms.

G6PD is an enzyme in erythrocytes that makes NADPH from NADP+.

Painless oral ulcers and nonspecific hair loss may also occur. Fatigue, joint pain, and fever are also common presenting signs. Lupus nephritis is a common complication of SLE, particularly in younger women. Patients with lupus nephritis typically present with evidence of active SLE and may additionally display oliguria or anuria, signs and symptoms of hypertension (eg, headache, visual disturbance), uremia (eg, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, altered mental status), hyperkalemia (eg, peaked T waves on ECG), and hypervolemia with peripheral edema. Lupus nephritis involves glomerular deposition of antibodies, including IgG, IgM, and IgA, as well as activation of the classical complement pathway. Laboratory studies therefore generally show hypocomplementemia with decreased serum concentrations of early classical pathway components such as C1q, C2, C3, C4, and CH50, as well as increased creatinine.

Asthma is characterized by the reversible obstruction to airflow caused by spasm of smooth muscle in the bronchi and small airways. It is often triggered by an allergen (eg, smoke, pollen), exercise, or temperature change. In the case of allergen-induced asthma, bronchoconstriction is triggered by IgE-mediated activation of mast cells, followed by degranulation and histamine release. Such mast cell activation is classified as a type | hypersensitivity reaction. These reactions are composed of two phases, the immediate and the late phase. In the immediate phase, preformed IgE on the surface of mast cells and basophils is crosslinked by an antigen leading to their degranulation and release of histamine, which results in vasodilation, vascular permeability, and bronchoconstriction among other effects. The late phase occurs hours after the initial insult and is mediated by the release of prostaglandins and leukotrienes synthesized by the mast cells.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient's laboratory studies and arterial blood gas analysis show a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis with partial compensation. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is identified by a pH less than 7.35 (acidemia), with decreased Pcoz and HCO; . The respiratory system compensates for the acidosis by increasing minute ventilation, which eliminates carbon dioxide, an acid. This results in decreased Pcog and increased pH back toward normal range. This patient's persistently decreased pH suggests that respiratory compensation is only partial. Metabolic acidosis describes a derangement involving excess acid and is subdivided into anion gap and non-anion gap categories. Anion gap [Na] - ([CI\"] + [HCO37]) calculates unmeasured anions in serum, which are contributing to acidity, whereas non-anion gap acidosis generally results from excess supply of protons or chloride, retention of protons or chloride by the kidney, or failure to secrete bicarbonate buffers. Non- anion gap acidosis is often a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, as seen in this patient. Causes of non-anion gap acidosis include infusions of normal saline, Addison disease, renal tubular acidosis, and gastrointestinal losses of bicarbonate (eg, diarrhea). In the case of diarrhea or gastrointestinal disturbance, such as in this patient, bicarbonate secreted in the small intestine is normally reclaimed in the large intestine in exchange for chloride ions. If the colon cannot reclaim bicarbonate, such as following colectomy or during diarrheal illness, the concentration of serum chloride will remain increased and serum bicarbonate decreased.",

It is caused by hypertrophy of the pylorus and an inability to relax the pyloric sphincter. Infants classically present within the first 1 to 2 months of life with forceful nonbilious emesis. Physical examination is notable for a characteristic ovoid mass in the epigastric region. The recurrent emesis, if severe, may result in signs of volume depletion and malnutrition. Laboratory studies typically show a hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis as a result of the loss of gastric hydrochloric acid and potassium ions. Additionally, the resultant volume depletion causes activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, resulting in renal losses of potassium and protons.

Rheumatic fever is a sequela of untreated Streptococcus (group A) infection, commonly pharyngitis, in which there is a type II hypersensitivity reaction to self-antigens having a similar structure to, and thus molecularly mimicking, streptococcal M protein. Diagnosis is made by the Jones criteria, which describe many of the core clinical features of rheumatic fever, including the major criteria of polyarthritis, carditis, subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum, and Sydenham chorea, as well as minor criteria of fever, leukocytosis, arthralgia, and PR interval prolongation. Patients often have an increased antistreptolysin O titer. Complications of rheumatic fever include mitral valve inflammation leading to long-term sequelae of chronic mitral valve regurgitation, prolapse, or stenosis. Treatment of the initial streptococcal infection is effective for reducing the risk for developing rheumatic fever. Per American Heart Association guidelines, once rheumatic fever has developed, treatment includes salicylates and a prolonged course of monthly penicillin treatments to reduce the risk for recurrence and further valvular damage. w e @ ° + say ic € > o  g",

It is caused by hypertrophy of the pylorus and an inability to relax the pyloric sphincter. Infants classically present within the first 1 to 2 months of life with forceful, nonbilious emesis. Physical examination is notable for a characteristic ovoid mass in the epigastric region. The recurrent emesis, if severe, may result in signs of volume depletion and malnutrition. Laboratory studies typically show a hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis caused by the loss of gastric hydrochloric acid and potassium ions. Additionally, the resultant volume depletion causes activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, resulting in renal losses of potassium and protons.
