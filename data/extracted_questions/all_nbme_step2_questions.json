Control of psychomotor agitation is the first step\nin management of patients with PCP intoxication for the safety of the patient and medical staff. Chemical sedation with benzodiazepines such as intramuscular lorazepam\nor midazolam can be administered to control symptoms. Once a patient is adequately sedated, further evaluation can be completed to assess for traumatic injuries or\ncomplications of PCP intoxication such as rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, and hypertension.

It is most commonly caused by viral-mediated inflammation or immune reaction in the setting\nof a herpes simplex or herpes zoster infection, although it can be idiopathic or caused by other viral infections or Lyme disease. The facial nerve carries fibers that\ninnervate the muscles of facial expression; therefore, Bell palsy presents with acute unilateral facial paralysis that includes forehead dysfunction. Alternatively, upper motor\nnerve lesions (eg, strokes) manifest with dysfunction of the lower face with sparing of the forehead (since the facial nerve nucleus controlling forehead musculature is\ndually innervated by upper motor neurons from bilateral precentral gyri). Consistent with facial nerve involvement, Bell palsy can be associated with loss of taste on the\nanterior two-thirds of the tongue and decreased lacrimation. Symptoms typically peak around 3 weeks, with slow recovery beginning within 6 months. Diagnosis is typically\nbased on clinical symptoms, but electrodiagnostic tests (eg, electromyelography) and imaging of the face and head can be utilized if the diagnosis is unclear. Initial\ntreatment consists of oral glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, and antiviral therapy in severe cases. Supportive care to prevent xerophthalmia or corneal abrasion should\nbe undertaken (eg, artificial tears, eye patching).",

When infection spreads to the fallopian tubes and\novaries, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can result, which presents with cervical motion tenderness, purulent cervical discharge, uterine and adnexal tenderness, and\nsystemic signs and symptoms such as fever, fatigue, nausea, and myalgias. Complications include tubo-ovarian or intra-abdominal abscess. Gram stain of the urine or\nurethral/vaginal discharge typically does not disclose organisms, as C. trachomatis is an obligate intracellular organism.

The pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy involves nonenzymatic\nglycosylation of the glomerular basement membrane and efferent arterioles. This results in thickening of the basement membrane along with compromise of the filtration\nbarrier, which leads to an increased permeability to solutes and proteins. Mesangial expansion of the efferent arteriole also occurs, which can initially increase the\nglomerular filtration rate (GFR). Diabetic nephropathy characteristically presents with eosinophilic nodular glomerulosclerosis, also known as Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules,\non biopsy. The combination of increased basement membrane permeability and initially increased GFR progresses over time in patients with diabetes mellitus, beginning\nas microalbuminuria, progressing to macroalbuminuria, and eventually to end-stage renal disease. Measurement of urine microalbumin concentration is the most sensitive\ntest to detect albumin in the urine to determine the risk for developing diabetic nephropathy.

Disease manifestations include colitis, retinitis, esophagitis, encephalitis, and pneumonia. The classic\nhistologic findings of CMV infection are mononuclear cell infiltrates with infected cells showing prominent intracellular inclusion bodies. Treatment for all human herpesvirus\ninfections involves drugs that inhibit viral DNA polymerase, classically by using guanosine analogs such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. Prior to exerting their\nantiviral effects, most guanosine analogs must be phosphorylated by the viral enzyme thymidine kinase. CMV does not have the necessary thymidine kinase needed for\nphosphorylation of most common guanosine analogs; however, it does have the necessary phosphorylating enzyme to activate ganciclovir.

While atrial fibrillation can be asymptomatic, symptoms with rapid ventricular response include palpitations, fatigue,\nshortness of breath, light-headedness, angina, and presyncope or syncope. Physical examination will demonstrate an irregularly irregular pulse and occasionally may\nshow signs of heart failure or a heart murmur.

Risk factors for the development of atrial\nfibrillation include hypertension, coronary artery disease, structural heart or valvular disease, pulmonary embolism, lung disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea or\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stimulant abuse, and hyperthyroidism. Complications of atrial fibrillation include tachycardia-induced heart failure, hemodynamic\ninstability, and left atrial appendage thrombus formation with subsequent embolic strokes. Patients with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation should receive evaluation for\npotentially reversible causes with measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration and screening for high-risk amounts of alcohol intake.

Diagnosis occurs through imaging and biopsy. Laboratory\nanalyses often show increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. On fluoroscopic small bowel follow-through, narrowing of the intestinal lumen at the\nterminal ileum is commonly seen, along with other sites of strictures or fistulous formation.

She notes that her lips have become swollen and feel especially \"itchy and tingly.\" She has had three episodes of\ndiarrhea. She appears flushed. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 27/min, and blood pressure is 85/42 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on\nroom air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Examination shows slightly swollen lips and cheeks and erythematous areas over the face and extremities. Breath\nsounds are decreased, and expiratory wheezes are heard throughout the lungs. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. In addition to epinephrine, which of the following\nshould be administered?",

TTP is a life-threatening\ncondition that results in rapid death if not recognized and treated. It is a thrombotic microangiopathy that occurs as a result of inhibition or deficiency of ADAMTS13, a\nmetalloprotease that degrades von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers. vWF is a circulating protein that aids in platelet adhesion and aggregation. Inappropriate activation\nwith impaired degradation leads to the formation of large vWF multimer complexes that obstruct the arterioles and cause mechanical trauma to passing erythrocytes.\nIntravascular hemolysis results in anemia while consumption of platelets leads to thrombocytopenia. End organ damage is also frequently seen as thrombi can obstruct\narterioles. The classic presentation includes the abrupt onset of fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and neurologic symptoms. Increased indirect bilirubin and\njaundice indicate hemolysis, not liver disease. Importantly, patients with TTP will have normal coagulation studies since the disease process does not involve consumption\nof coagulation factors or activation of the coagulation cascade. While TTP can be hereditary, it is more commonly a result of an autoantibody inhibitor against ADAMTS13,\nso treatment is with urgent plasmapheresis to remove the circulating antibody.",

Pterygia derive their name\nfrom the Greek pterygos, or “wing,” for their wing-like appearance. Histologically, pterygia are characterized by degeneration of subepithelial tissue, fibrovascular\nproliferation with destruction of the corneal Bowman membrane, and elastotic degeneration. Pterygia are caused by environmental hazards such as ultraviolet radiation,\nhot and dry climates, dust, and wind. The diagnosis is clinical, and biopsy is not typically required. Patients typically present with symptoms of irritation, redness, foreign\nbody sensation, or blurry vision as a result of obstruction of the visual axis and induction of irregular astigmatism by the pterygium. Treatment includes topical lubrication\nand reduction of ultraviolet light exposure by wearing sunglasses while outdoors. Pterygia may slowly expand over time and extend over the cornea. Patients with\nintolerable symptoms, visual disturbance, or unacceptable cosmetic appearance may require surgical excision. Surgical excision involves complete excision of the\npterygium from the conjunctiva and cornea followed by patching of the conjunctival defect with a conjunctival autograft or with amniotic membrane.

Patients typically\ncomplain of chronic pain in a joint that is worse with movement or exertion and is improved with rest, often with limited range of motion because of underlying joint space\nnarrowing and pain. Imaging may demonstrate joint space narrowing, as seen in the x-ray of the knee, and might show osteophytosis and subchondral cystic or sclerotic\nchanges. First-line treatment is with acetaminophen, although only a minority of patients will achieve meaningful relief with this therapy alone.

Use of\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), even for short durations, is associated with an increased risk for acute myocardial infarction. The mechanism of adverse\ncardiovascular effects is likely related to cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition and disruption of the normal balance of prostaglandins and other arachidonic acid derivatives in\nresponse to endothelial injury. Significant left ventricular dysfunction may result in cardiogenic pulmonary edema with shortness of breath, tachypnea, hypoxemia, audible\nrales, and S,or S, gallop.

Cholesterol\nembolization syndrome occurs secondary to the embolization of atherosclerotic plaque contents (eg, cholesterol crystals) from a proximal large artery (eg, aorta) to distal\nsmall arteries and arterioles. This results in occlusion of the distal arterial vasculature with cholesterol emboli, which induces a localized inflammatory response and end-\norgan damage. Dermatologic manifestations of this phenomenon are localized petechiae, livedo reticularis, and blue toe syndrome. Histology of skin lesions discloses\nbiconvex needle-shaped clefts within the arterial lumen left by dissolved cholesterol crystals. Laboratory findings include increased creatinine and leukocytosis with\neosinophilia. Risk factors for cholesterol embolization syndrome include trauma, interventional procedures that increase the risk for damage and dislodgement of\natherosclerotic plaques such as cardiac catheterization, and aortic dissection.

This patient is likely suffering from asthma triggered\nby an allergen she is exposed to at her new place of employment, given that her symptoms resolve completely by the end of the weekend. Acute episodes typically\npresent with episodes of wheezing, dry cough, and dyspnea. Physical examination often shows tachycardia, tachypnea, diffuse wheezes (rhonchi), and prolonged\nexpiration relative to inspiration. Air trapping may occur during acute episodes, which decreases lung density (leading to diminished tactile fremitus, hyperresonance to\npercussion, and hyperinflation on chest imaging). Pulmonary function tests may be normal between symptomatic exacerbations, but during such episodes, they typically\ndemonstrate an obstructive pattern with a decreased FEV ,:FVC ratio as well as increased residual volume and total lung capacity. A decreased peak expiratory flow rate\ncaused by obstructed airways is expected.\nIncorrect Answers: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and |.\nChoices B and C are incorrect since the peak expiratory flow rate is expected to decrease during an acute asthma exacerbation and the percent reduction from baseline\ncorrelates well with episode severity.\nChoices D, E, and F are incorrect since the FEV ,:FVC ratio is decreased in obstructive lung disease as would be expected during an acute asthma exacerbation. An\nincreased ratio is suggestive of restrictive lung disease caused by decreased compliance of fibrotic lung tissue resulting in greater initial expiratory force.\nChoices G, H, and | are incorrect in the setting of acute symptoms. Choice |, with normal spirometry and peak expiratory flow rate, is expected in between symptomatic\nepisodes when inflammation related to the asthma trigger has subsided and airway obstruction is relieved. The presence of end-expiratory wheezes, hyperresonance to\npercussion suggestive of air trapping, and ongoing symptoms with a continued exposure indicate that pulmonary function is likely abnormal at this time.\nEducational Objective: Asthma is characterized by reversible obstruction of the bronchi secondary to hyperreactivity and airway inflammation.

The diarrhea caused by rotavirus is watery, profuse, often foul-\nsmelling, and typically nonbloody. Children with gastroenteritis are at increased risk for volume depletion in comparison with adults. Clinical signs of volume depletion\ninclude tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, and prolonged capillary refill. Children may present with irritability or lethargy. If\ndiarrhea is severe, laboratory evaluation can show perturbations in serum sodium and potassium concentrations. Severe volume depletion secondary to diarrhea is usually\naccompanied by a significant stool loss of bicarbonate, which, in combination with the hypoperfusion of end organs resulting in lactic acidosis, may result in severe\nmetabolic acidosis. However, in mild cases of diarrhea without significant electrolyte abnormalities, vital sign abnormalities, or signs of shock, and when the patient is able\nto tolerate nutrition by mouth, oral rehydration is the mainstay of management. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is first-line for the treatment of fluid and electrolyte losses\ncaused by mild to moderate gastroenteritis. ORT is advantageous because of its lower cost, ease of administration, noninvasive treatment, and ability to be continued at\nhome by caregivers.",

It is caused by the accumulation of serum ketones such as B-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone in the setting of insulin\ndeficiency or acute catabolic stressors such as infection. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis occurs because of the relative state of starvation\ncreated by absent insulin signaling. Vital signs may show tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension as a result of severe hypovolemia, which occurs secondary to osmotic\ndiuresis from hyperglycemia. Patients may demonstrate physical examination signs of hypovolemia (eg, dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor) along with a\nsweet breath odor secondary to ketones. Laboratory analysis typically demonstrates increased serum glucose and ketones, metabolic acidosis, and a high anion gap\ncaused by the accumulation of unmeasured anions in serum. Metabolic acidosis is accompanied by a decreased bicarbonate concentration in the serum, since\nbicarbonate is consumed in the neutralization of increased acidic molecules (hydrogen ions) in the blood. Patients commonly demonstrate respiratory compensation (an\nincreased respiratory rate and consequently decreased Pco,). The initial management of DKA should focus on volume repletion with isotonic fluids such as normal saline,\nwhich is crucial to hemodynamically stabilize the patient, restore tissue perfusion, and clear ketones. Volume repletion should be followed by insulin, correction of\nelectrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions.",

Adrenal crisis can be precipitated by a\nphysiologic stressor (eg, surgery, trauma, infection) that acutely increases the body’s demand for corticosteroids, which cannot be met because of chronic adrenal gland\natrophy. The patient has also likely not been able to take her oral medications in the setting of a drinking binge and not eating. Adrenal insufficiency presents with\nhypoglycemia, altered mental status, hyponatremia, tachycardia, and abnormal vasodilation. Adrenal crisis is marked by significant volume depletion and fluid- and\nvasopressor-refractory hypotension. While difficult to diagnose because of its nonspecific presentation, acute adrenal crisis should be considered in the differential of any\npatient presenting with circulatory collapse.

It can cause chemical burns and ulcerations of the\ntongue, airway, and esophagus, resulting in stridor, hoarseness, vomiting, and drooling. If severe, esophageal perforation can ensue, leading to free air in the\nmediastinum, known as Boerhaave syndrome, a surgical emergency. Treatment is initially focused on supportive measures including airway management and fluid\nresuscitation. Visible lesions in the oropharynx increase the likelihood of distal gastrointestinal lesions. Patients should be emergently evaluated with esophagoscopy\n(endoscopy) to assess for visceral injury and guide management. For severe injuries, treatment involves steroid administration. In contrast to many toxic ingestions\nactivated charcoal is contraindicated because of the coating of ulcerated mucosa, potential for extraluminal spread into the mediastinum, and impairment of visualization\non endoscopy.",

This occurs when slow-growing cancers that have\na long asymptomatic phase are preferentially detected earlier in their course by the screening. Slow-growing cancers have a longer asymptomatic phase and thus a larger\nwindow during which screening will identify asymptomatic disease. In contrast, fast-growing cancers have a shorter asymptomatic phase because they cause symptoms\nsooner that cause patients to seek medical care. Based on the length of their asymptomatic window, slow-growing cancers are more likely to be found with screening\nCancers that grow slowly are less likely to cause death than cancers that grow rapidly, so if the screening program preferentially identifies slow-growing cancers, then the\noverall survival of patients will be overestimated and will not reflect cases of rapidly growing cancer that caused death. When length bias is present, it may appear that\noverall survival is improved, when the cause of the improved outcome is actually that the slow-growing tumors inherently have a survival advantage over fast-growing\ntumors and are overrepresented in the sample population. Length bias may give the impression that survival has increased as a result of screening, but in fact, the natural\nhistory of the disease process has not changed. Less fatal tumors have just been preferentially identified.",

Celiac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy that is mediated through\nimmune intolerance of the protein gliadin, commonly found in wheat products. This results in inflammatory infiltration of the proximal small bowel, which leads to\ncharacteristic intraepithelial lymphocytosis, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. Malabsorption of substances in the proximal small bowel ensues, which presents\nsymptomatically as chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, and nutritional deficiencies. Patients with celiac disease may develop iron deficiency anemia, which may be present on\nlaboratory evaluation with decreased hematocrit and microcytosis. In children, the introduction of gluten into the diet quickly leads to the development of symptoms which\nmay occur as early as 2 years of age and may lead to decreased growth and nutritional deficiency if untreated. The majority of children with significant villous atrophy will\ndevelop iron deficiency anemia. The presence of unexplained iron deficiency anemia, particularly in the setting of other autoimmune disease, should prompt an evaluation\nfor celiac disease. The diagnosis of celiac disease can be confirmed by the detection of serum anti-transglutaminase antibodies or by small bowel biopsy demonstrating\nvillous atrophy along with intraepithelial lymphocytes and crypt hyperplasia. Treatment includes avoidance of gluten-containing foods and reversal of any acquired\nnutritional deficiencies",

Selective IgA deficiency describes an absence of IgA with normal concentrations of\nIgG, and normal or increased concentrations of IgM. IgA is critical for immune health and functions in two primary ways. First, IgA binds pathogen surface antigens,\ntargeting them for opsonization, complement activation, and phagocytosis. Second, IgA coats mucosal surfaces and prevents colonization, adhesion, and invasion by\npathogenic microorganisms. Immunoglobulins are produced by plasma cells, which are terminally differentiated B lymphocytes; as a result, most causal deficiencies are\nhypothesized to be related to B lymphocyte abnormalities. Despite this, there is clinical heterogeneity in the severity of IgA deficiency. Some patients remain asymptomatic\nwhile others suffer from recurrent sinopulmonary infections. Anaphylactic reactions to blood products such as plasma (which contains donor immunoglobulin) are classic\nbut uncommon, since not all patients with IgA deficiency have reactions to blood products. Such severe reactions are most common in patients with undetectable\nconcentrations of IgA; these reactions occur because of the presence of preformed antibodies against IgA, which in these patients is a non-native protein and thus a target\nof immune activation.",

Measurement of TSH and free thyroxine (FT,) is useful for\nestablishing the diagnosis and typically displays abnormalities consistent with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Some patients display autoantibodies against thyroid\nperoxidase, while some do not. Patients with symptomatic hyperthyroidism benefit from treatment with metoprolol or propranolol. Those with symptomatic hypothyroidism\nbenefit from treatment with levothyroxine. Most patients regain a euthyroid state after several months, although a minority of patients develop chronic hypothyroidism.",

This leads to increased concentrations of glucose in the maternal circulation, and subsequently the\nfetal circulation. Fetal hyperglycemia in turn causes the fetus to produce excess insulin, which acts as a growth factor and leads to macrosomia. Risk factors for gestational\ndiabetes include obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), previous gestational diabetes, and African American, Asian American, Hispanic, Native American, and\nPacific Islander ethnicity.

In this example, the two variables being studied are cardiovascular disease and cigarette smoking. The positive correlation found\nbetween increased risk for cardiovascular disease and number of cigarettes smoked daily indicates that as the number of cigarettes smoked daily increased, so does the\nrisk for cardiovascular disease. This is an example of a dose-response relationship. The number of cigarettes smoked daily is considered the dose, and risk for\ncardiovascular disease is considered the response. The positive correlation between the two is more suggestive of causation than if the risk for cardiovascular disease\nwere the same no matter what number of cigarettes were smoked daily. Thus, the presence of a dose-response relationship in this study is one criterion for causality.",

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is\ndefined as a positive PPD skin test or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) in the absence of active pulmonary or disseminated infection with Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis (MTB). Risk factors for exposure to MTB include residence in a region of the world where it is endemic, employment as a healthcare worker, or residence in\nprisons or homeless shelters. The PPD skin test is considered positive at varying sizes of induration based on the population in which the test is done. While patients with\nHIV and other conditions that cause immunosuppression are considered to have a positive PPD skin test if the induration is measured at or above 5 mm, the general\npopulation is considered to have a positive test if the induration is 15 mm or greater. Health care workers or those who work with high-risk populations are often considered\nto have positive results warranting treatment at 10 mm of induration. While the bCG can cause a false-positive PPD reaction, the effect usually wanes within 5 years of\nvaccination, so this patient's induration should not be attributed to prior vaccination status.

No particular class of antidepressant medication is more\neffective than the other, though different classes have different adverse effect profiles.

Serotonergic medications (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs) commonly impair sexual function within all three phases of sexual\nresponse (libido, sexual arousal, and orgasm). Mirtazapine, an atypical antidepressant medication, is a selective a.-receptor antagonist and serotonin modulator that both\nincreases serotonin release and antagonizes serotonin receptors. Because of its serotonin receptor antagonism, mirtazapine carries a decreased risk for sexual\ndysfunction compared to antidepressant medications that purely inhibit serotonin reuptake.

Severe inhalant toxicity can manifest with tachydysrhythmias and respiratory depression, and\nultimately seizures or coma. Treatment is primarily supportive, though some inhalants have specific antidotes (eg, methylene blue for nitrites). Prevention is key; schools\nshould monitor use of solvent-based products, and parents and children should be educated about the risks of inhalants.",

Aldosterone is produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex and plays an important role in the maintenance of blood volume and sodium\nhomeostasis, primarily through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway. Renin is produced by the juxtaglomerular cells as a response to decreased blood flow to the\nrenal system, decreased sodium delivery to the macula densa, or increased sympathetic tone. Renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin |, which is then converted to\nangiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II subsequently signals the adrenal gland to secrete aldosterone. Aldosterone promotes the\nreabsorption of sodium ions in exchange for potassium and hydrogen ion secretion in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts, causing the indirect reabsorption of\nwater, which results in the development of hypertension. Increased concentrations of aldosterone provide negative feedback to renin, decreasing its production. Primary\nhyperaldosteronism presents with hypertension, metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and an increased aldosterone-to-renin ratio caused by the independent secretion of\naldosterone, most commonly from an adrenal adenoma, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, or familial hyperaldosteronism.",

Risk factors for cervical cancer\ninclude human papillomavirus (HPV) high risk strain 16, 18, 31, or 33 infections, early age at onset of sexual activity, tobacco use, oral contraceptive use,\nimmunosuppression, and infection with HIV or other sexually transmitted infections. Cervical cancer classically presents with painless vaginal bleeding, with or without\nintercourse. It may locally invade into the bladder or rectum if advanced and can result in hydronephrosis by obstructing the distal ureteral insertions to the bladder. If\ndistant spread occurs, the lung is a common site of metastatic disease.",

This results in\ninflammatory infiltration of the proximal small bowel, which leads to characteristic intraepithelial lymphocytosis, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. Malabsorption of\nsubstances in the proximal small bowel ensues, which presents symptomatically as chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, and nutritional deficiencies. Malabsorption often results\nin the impaired absorption of vitamin D, leading to hypocalcemia and secondary osteomalacia. Patients may also develop a secondary hyperparathyroidism and\nhypophosphatemia in an attempt to compensate for poor gastrointestinal calcium absorption. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning can be useful for\nassessing bone density in patients with celiac disease who are at risk for osteomalacia.

ECG discloses an irregular,\nnarrow-complex arrhythmia lacking P-waves, consistent with atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation typically presents with palpitations, fatigue, lightheadedness, and dyspnea if\nsymptomatic. Atrial fibrillation can result from a variety of factors, including dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, alcohol or illicit drug use, and structural heart disease.\nFor example, mitral stenosis, if severe enough, can result in left atrial enlargement, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and flutter.\nHyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis are also associated with the development of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation can be complicated by a rapid ventricular response (pulse\n>100/min), which can result in reduced stroke volume and decreased cardiac output leading to symptomatic heart failure, and potentially hypotension and hemodynamic\ninstability in severe cases. In these cases, rate- or rhythm-controlling agents and/or synchronized cardioversion may be necessary. However, in this patient who is\nhemodynamically stable with a normal ventricular rate, no further interventions are necessary other than intravenous fluid resuscitation for the patient's dehydration, which\nwill likely improve his symptoms.

Frequently, this type of infection also causes acute renal failure. Shiga-toxin causes diffuse endothelial dysfunction with a tendency toward microvascular\nthrombosis.

They also release lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leading to an increased concentration of serum LDH, while haptoglobin is depleted by binding to free\nhemoglobin. Thrombosis also occurs in the renal vasculature because of underlying endothelial damage, resulting in renal injury. Treatment of STEC is supportive.\nAntibiotics are typically avoided as they can result in increased release of shiga-toxin and clinical deterioration, although in some instances the use of macrolide antibiotics\nhas been shown to be beneficial.

Thus, the patient's pretest probability of having pancreatic cancer is low and the predictive value of her positive test is also low.

Thalassemia can occur in a variety of forms, and manifestations depend on the number of\nallele deletions or mutations, and whether these mutations affect the a-globin or B-globin alleles. The fact that this patient has decreased concentrations of hemoglobin A\n(a-B,) and increased concentrations of hemoglobin F (a-y,) suggests a deficiency in production of B-globin chains, which is consistent with B-thalassemia. Given that\nthere are only two B-globin alleles, deletion or mutation of one of these genes (or regulatory elements) can lead to a profound reduction in B-globin, causing microcytic\nanemia (B-thalassemia intermedia). Mutations in both alleles, on the other hand, results in near absence of B-globin and leads to profound, transfusion-dependent anemia\nin addition to physical features that suggest extramedullary hematopoiesis, such as frontal bossing (thalassemia major). B-thalassemia minor (trait) is the inheritance of\none deleted or mutated allele, but the remaining normal allele is sufficient to produce the beta chain, and patients are generally asymptomatic. Treatment for thalassemia\nintermedia is supportive, and most patients do not routinely require blood transfusions.",

Measles (rubeola) virus is a highly contagious paramyxovirus that causes the disease\nmeasles, which is associated with acute febrile illness and potentially severe sequelae. It is more common in children than adults. It characteristically presents with\nprodromal fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and a confluent maculopapular rash that starts at the head and neck and spreads to the trunk, excluding the palms and\nsoles. Physical examination may show bright red macules with a bluish-white center on the buccal mucosa and lymphadenopathy. Measles is prevented by immunization\nwith the live MMR vaccine. Live attenuated vaccines are made of viable viral pathogens whose virulence has been reduced but occasionally replication of the strain\ncontained in the vaccine can cause symptoms such as fever, transient rash, or transient joint pain. Other live attenuated vaccines include the yellow fever, intranasal\ninfluenza, smallpox, varicella-zoster, rotavirus, and the oral poliovirus vaccines. The patient lacks other clinical manifestations of true measles infection including prodromal\nfever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and Koplik spots, so his presentation is most likely caused by replication of the measles strain contained in the live vaccine.",

Inadequate production of ADH by the posterior pituitary gland\nmay occur in the setting of various pathologies, such as pituitary tumors, trauma, tuberculosis, or intracranial surgery. This results in a decreased concentration of\naquaporin channels inserted within the principal cells of the collecting tubule, leading to an inability to absorb adequate amounts of free water, which results in dilute urine\nand increased serum osmolality.

Gonococcal\ninfections are aggressive and can rapidly progress to keratitis, corneal perforation, or endophthalmitis. Chlamydial conjunctivitis presents within 5 to 14 days of birth and is\ncharacterized by watery discharge. Herpetic conjunctivitis presents greater than 14 days after birth. All neonates should be given topical antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent\ngonococcal conjunctivitis. Historically, topical silver nitrate was a common prophylactic agent that was also a frequent cause of chemical conjunctivitis, which presents\nwithin the first 3 days after birth. The use of silver nitrate has more recently been supplanted by the use of topical erythromycin, which binds to bacterial ribosomal 50S\nsubunits to prevent protein synthesis.",

Sensitivity is the ability of a test to detect a\ndisease if it is present. Sensitivity may be calculated as 1 — false negative rate. A test is described as sensitive if it has a high likelihood of disease detection, and therefore\na low likelihood of a false negative (type 2 error). High sensitivity is therefore useful in ruling out a disease. Along with sensitivity, specificity is also used to measure the\nquality of a diagnostic test. A test is described as specific if it has a high likelihood that when disease is absent, the test is negative; it therefore has a low likelihood of a\nfalse positive (type 1 error). Specificity may be calculated as 1 — false positive rate. High specificity is useful when considering a disease. In this case, assuming that the\npatient's infiltrating ductal carcinoma was present at the time of her mammography 6 months earlier, the patient had a false negative mammography result: her test result\nwas negative when she actually had disease. Because sensitivity is calculated as 1 — false negative rate, the false negative rate (the value desired by this patient) can be\neasily determined by subtracting the sensitivity from 100%.

CVID classically presents in the second to fourth\ndecades of life as multiple, recurrent sinus or pulmonary infections, including pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinusitis. Chronic lung infections can result in bronchiectasis, and\ninfections of the gastrointestinal tract are also frequently encountered. Patients with CVID are at an increased risk for the development of autoimmune disease such as\nrheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and autoimmune thyroid disease. Additionally, they have a higher risk for cancer, especially gastric cancer and non-\nHodgkin lymphoma. The diagnosis is made by quantitative measurement of serum immunoglobulins, which universally shows decreased concentrations of IgG, IgA,\nand/or IgM. The pathogenesis involves impaired B-lymphocyte differentiation into plasma cells and therefore impaired production of immunoglobulins. As a result of failed\nantibody production, patients have a blunted and sometimes absent response to immunization, which is supportive of the diagnosis in patients with classic findings.\nTreatment is with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG).",

The first step in identifying the cause of hyponatremia is\ncalculating the serum osmolality. Serum osmolality = (2*Na) + (BUN/2.8) + (glucose/18). When serum osmolality is >295, as in this case (serum Osm = 300), then\nhypertonic hyponatremia is present. This is caused by excessive solute in the plasma such as glucose, mannitol, or contrast agents. These agents cause movement of\nwater from intracellular to extracellular spaces, causing dilution of sodium in the process. In this case, the patient has an extremely elevated glucose which is also causing\nhyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic (HHNK) state. HHNK, also known as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), is a condition of severe hyperglycemia and\nincreased serum osmolality resulting in profound dehydration, without the abnormal production of ketones. This typically occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus\nafter an inciting stress event, such as an acute infection. The increased osmolality results in excessive osmotic diuresis in the kidneys, which leads to progressive, marked\ndehydration. Presenting symptoms include lethargy, thirst, polyuria, altered mental status, and potential coma and death if untreated. Laboratory studies typically show\nhyperglycemia (>500 mg/dL), and increased osmolality without acidosis because of the lack of ketone production. Treatment requires aggressive fluid resuscitation with\nisotonic intravenous fluids and insulin.",

In severe cases, mediastinal structures may be stretched or compressed, compromising\nvenous return, resulting in obstructive shock (known as a tension pneumothorax). On physical examination, a pneumothorax presents as unilateral diminished breath sounds with hyperresonance to\npercussion. Pneumothorax can appear on chest x-ray as radiolucent air and the absence of interstitial lung markings in the pleural space adjacent to the lung parenchyma. If a pneumothorax is large, tube\nthoracostomy should be performed to evacuate the air in the pleural space to aid in lung re-expansion. Once a chest tube is placed and healing of the inciting injury occurs, leakage of air into the pleural\nspace should stop. If a persistent air leak is noted, the source of the leak should be investigated. A ruptured bronchus requires extended time to heal and is a potential source of air leak. If the leak persists,\nsurgical correction of the rupture may be required to prevent chronic pneumothorax from a resultant bronchopleural fistula.",

Signs\nand symptoms include petechiae, purpura, mucosa! bleeding, menorrhagia, and prolonged bleeding from minor injuries. The underlying cause is incompletely understood but involves formation of antiplatelet\nlgG antibodies with subsequent platelet opsonization and phagocytosis by splenic macrophages. The diagnosis is one of exclusion after other potential causes of thrombocytopenia, such as viral infection,\nhematologic malignancy, and adverse effects of medication have been ruled out. Bone marrow biopsy will most likely show an increased number of megakaryocytes indicating adequate platelet production\nbut increased peripheral destruction of platelets. Platelets appear normal on peripheral blood smear. Coagulation studies are also normal, although bleeding lime is prolonged. ITP often occurs following an\ninfection, frequently with Helicobacter pylori, Epstein-Barr virus, or HIV, and is generally self-limited. Chronic ITP is first treated with steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or immunomodulatory drugs.\nRefractory ITP is treated with splenectomy, which results in remission of thrombocytopenia in most cases.",

Premature delivery in early pregnancy results in stillbirth caused by incomplete development of the\nneonatal lungs and brain, which do not complete their maturation until the end of the second trimester. The diagnosis of death in newborns requires a careful examination, which may be complicated by the\nfact that many reflexes are not fully developed, and ocular examination (as well as examination of corneal, vestibular, and oculocephalic reflexes) may be impossible. Apnea testing is a reliable method for\ndiagnosing death and involves providing adequate oxygenation via ventilator, followed by observation of a rise in carbon dioxide levels caused by lack of spontaneous respirations as the ventilator is\nweaned. EEG is not usually necessary, but, if performed, demonstrates electrocerebral silence, or lack of electrical waveforms. In the setting of death in a nonviable, premature newborn, it is appropriate to\ndiscontinue resuscitative efforts.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Acetaminophen is the most appropriate medication to administer to this patient who most likely has osteoarthritis (OA). Older patients commonly develop OA in the fingers and in weight-bearing joints, such\nas the knees and hips. The characteristics of the pain are important in differentiating OA from inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, which can also present in older patients. OA pain tends to\nworsen throughout the day with continued use, whereas inflammatory pain tends to be worse in the morning and improve after about 1 hour of continual use. Brief stiffness in the morning may occur with OA\nbut typically resolves within about 1 hour. The diagnosis is clinical, although plain film x-rays may be helpful and often show Joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis. First-line\ntreatment of OA includes acetaminophen. Other medications include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), although these should be avoided in patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or\nchronic kidney disease. Topical NSAID preparations are another viable alternative that provides relief to some patients without the systemic effects of oral NSAIDs.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "While randomized controlled trials form the gold standard of medical research and generate more powerful evidence than other forms of observational or descriptive studies, they remain susceptible to\nerror. A common form of error results from limitations in the number of study participants, which in turn limits statistical power, or the ability of the study to detect a difference between groups if one exists.\nIncreasing the power of a study can generally be completed through a larger sample size and improving precision in measurements. When the power of a study is increased, the incidence of a type II error\ndecreases. A type II error occurs when a study demonstrates no difference between the null and alternative hypotheses, when in fact, a difference exists. The type II error rate is calculated by subtracting\nthe power from 100%. A meta-analysis is a form of study in which statistical analysis is performed lo combine the results of multiple studies addressing the same question. Meta-analysis is useful for\novercoming limitations of the constituent studies within the meta-analysis. By pooling the results of multiple studies, meta-analyses reduce the risk for type II error caused by the smaller sample sizes within\neach constituent randomized controlled trial. However, meta-analyses are susceptible to their own errors, primarily related to inclusion criteria, statistical methods, and the errors of constituent studies.",

The most common age range for the onset of puberty in females is age 9 to 12 years, although this can vary\nmarkedly among patients based on factors such as body weight and ethnicity. Precocious puberty refers to the onset of secondary sexual characteristics before the age of 8 years in females or 9 years in\nmales. It can be idiopathic or have a variety of causes, such as central nervous system lesions, ovarian or germ cell tumors, adrenal disorders, or genetic defects such as McCune-Albright syndrome.\nPrecocious puberty can be further defined as central or peripheral. Central precocious puberty is caused by an early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, whereas peripheral precocious\npuberty is caused by the excessive release of estrogens or androgens. Ovarian tumors, such as sex cord-stromal tumors, can present with precocious puberty in children, which is the likely cause in this\npatient given the MRI findings.

Loss of these neurotransmitters permits\nabnormal transition from wakefulness to REM sleep. Patients may experience hallucinations, cataplexy, and sleep paralysis. The diagnosis can be made in patients with daytime somnolence and cataplexy,\nor in cases where cataplexy is not present, with multiple sleep latency tests that show a shorter time from wakefulness to the initiation of REM sleep.

Symptoms include the rapid onset of bronchospasm with dyspnea or wheezing, urticaria, flushing, nausea and emesis, edematous lips and tongue, and\nhypotension with tachycardia. When severe and untreated, ii can progress to circulatory collapse with cardiovascular arrest or death caused by asphyxiation and airway obstruction. Treatment includes the\nadministration of epinephrine, antihistamines, bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids, as well as intravenous fluids. Severe cases may require endotracheal intubation and the administration of vasopressors.\nPatients with a history of atopy, such as asthma and eczema, and a history of medication allergies are at increased risk for anaphylaxis.

Calcium-containing stones are the most common varieties, although renal calculi may also be composed of cystine, struvite, and uric acid. While abdominal plain x-rays were traditionally used for\ndiagnosis, urate stones are radiolucent, and given the availability and sensitivity of advanced imaging, a noncontrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is now the preferred imaging modality for definitive\ndiagnosis. One exception to this is in pediatrics, where imaging modalities that involve less radiation, such as ultrasonography and x-ray, are often used before modalities such as CT.

Patients with\nmyasthenia gravis possess antibodies that block or destroy nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which interferes with neuromuscular Junction signaling. Many patients with myasthenia gravis have\nthymic hyperplasia or thymoma. In myasthenia gravis, the thymus, which is the site of T-lymphocyte maturation, may show abnormalities in the presentation of the nAChR as an antigen to helper T\nlymphocytes. This abnormal antigen presentation is postulated to result in autoimmune attack of the nAChR on skeletal muscle cells. Patients present with progressively worsening skeletal muscle weakness\nat rest and fatigability on activation in focal or generalized muscle groups. Thus, nerve conduction studies with repetitive stimulation are used to confirm the diagnosis. The ocular, bulbar, and neck muscles\nare commonly affected. Most concerningly, respiratory muscle weakness can lead to respiratory insufficiency, and in an acute flare, these patients may require mechanical ventilation. Management includes\nsymptomatic treatments such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors along with immune modulating therapies. In patients with or without thymoma, complete thymectomy may be curative.",

It may be caused by rare congenital conditions, but most cases are secondary to a noncongenital condition. Of these, pulmonary pathology is the most\ncommon cause. The pathophysiology is associated with hypoxemia-related changes in systemic growth factor regulation. Other causes include primary cardiac, gastrointestinal, or hepatic disease, as well as\nmetastatic malignancy.

It typically presents with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and distention. Partial SBO allows a degree of\ncontinued flatus with diminished stooling, and complete SBO results in obstipation (no passage of stool or flatus). SBO has many potential causes, with formation of peritoneal adhesions following a previous\nintra-abdominal surgery being the most frequent. On physical examination, SBO typically presents with abdominal tenderness, distension, tympany to percussion, and borborygmi (high-pitched, hyperactive\nbowel sounds). Potential complications of SBO include bowel rupture and/or necrosis, which can result in sudden-onset peritoneal abdominal signs, such as rebound tenderness and guarding. Abdominal x\nrays typically show dilated small bowel loops and can also have multiple air-fluid levels. Management requires bowel rest and intravenous hydration followed by surgical intervention if the obstruction does\nnot reduce on its own.

The thyroid gland is situated anterior to the trachea and consists of two lobes\nthat are connected by a smaller isthmus. The thyroid is located near a variety of vascular and neurologic structures. The recurrent laryngeal nerves run posteriorly to the two lobes bilaterally. They provide\nmuscle innervation for both abduction and adduction of the vocal cords, as well as sensation to the region below the glottis. Special care is taken to identify these nerves during thyroidectomy to avoid nerve\ninjury, often with direct intraoperative nerve monitoring. Unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis can lead to voice hoarseness caused by the inability to abduct the vocal cord on one side, whereas\nbilateral paralysis can lead to airway obstruction as both vocal cords remain in a medial position. This patient has respiratory distress with audible stridor, indicating an upper airway obstruction, the likelihood\nof which is further reinforced by decreased breath sounds bilaterally caused by poor air movement through the obstruction. Given the onset of this patient's symptoms immediately after surgery, the most\nlikely cause of this presentation is bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis leading to vocal cord paralysis and airway obstruction.",

In advanced stages, profound vision loss may result from retinal\ngeographic atrophy or choroidal neovascularization with associated macular edema, exudation, or hemorrhage. Risk factors for AMO include age, smoking, and genetics. The diagnosis is established by a\ndilated funduscopic examination to evaluate the retina.

This can be exceptionally challenging in patients taking opioids prior to surgery as they often have an increased tolerance to opioids and require\nlarger doses than the opioid-naive patient. The classic approach to perioperative pain control includes a multimodal technique, including acetaminophen, local anesthetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\ndrugs, and oral and intravenous opioids. Patient-controlled analgesia is a method of providing pain control frequently used in the opioid-tolerant population or for those with significant postoperative pain. It\ninvolves programming a pump to deliver a small bolus dose of parenteral opioid in response to the patient pressing a button with a lockout interval and maximum dose to prevent overdose. This allows the\npatient to control the frequency of analgesic medication rather than be reliant on the nurse for pain medication distribution and improves patient satisfaction. Additionally, it allows the practitioner to calculate\na total opioid requirement that may be utilized to transition the patient to an effective oral regimen. This patient has hypertension likely related to his ongoing significant pain in the setting of previous opioid\nuse, given that his blood pressure improves after pain medication administration. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to improve his hypertension should be aimed at treating his pain.",

Cholestasis is accompanied by Jaundice, visible at a bilirubin concentration\nof 2 mg/dL or greater, and pruritus. Biliary motility is triggered by oral intake and neurohormonal control stimulated in part by feeding and gastric motility. A lack of oral intake, such as in cases of total\nparenteral nutrition (TPN), with resultant limited gastric emptying will also cause limited biliary drainage and limited gallbladder contractility. In addition, TPN can cause bile duct inflammation, fibrosis, and\nbiliary obstruction, which describes the clinical picture of cholestasis. TPN-induced cholestasis is more common in patients with a short bowel. Cholestasis is defined by increased indirect and/or direct\nbilirubin caused by the inability to excrete bilirubin. Typically, liver transaminases and alkaline phosphatase concentrations are not increased. Management of this condition involves discontinuing TPN and\nproviding enteral feeding.",

Preeclampsia may lead to uteroplacental insufficiency that puts the fetus at risk for fetal growth restriction. If untreated, preeclampsia\ncan progress to eclampsia, characterized by maternal seizures, which can have profoundly adverse outcomes. Additionally, preeclampsia increases the risk for abruptio placentae, or premature separation of\nthe placenta from the uterus, which can lead to fetal exsanguination. Abruptio placentae most commonly presents with vaginal bleeding, severe uterine pain, and tetanic contractions. Thus, the most likely\ncomplication during labor for this patient is abruptio placentae based on her underlying preeclampsia.",

The disease\nusually presents with an insidious onset of psychiatric (eg, irritability, depression, psychosis) and cognitive symptoms. Motor symptoms (eg, chorea, hypotonia, dystonia, loss of voluntary control of\nmovements) typically appear later in the disease course. People with HD typically die 10 to 40 years after disease onset. Chorea, a key HD symptom, can be initially experienced as restlessness. Chorea is\ndistinguished by irregular, unpredictable muscle movements that tend to flow from one muscle group to another. Treatment is symptomatic and can include tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine, which target\nchorea by depleting dopamine stores. HD is caused by expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (CAG) on chromosome 4, which occurs when a series of three nucleotides in repetition are replicated incorrectly\nand too many repeats are included in the replicated product. HD also demonstrates anticipation, a genetic inheritance phenomenon in which future generations are affected at a younger age or with more\nsevere symptoms.",

If there is clinical concern for SBP, the\nascites fluid should be sampled through a paracentesis. Laboratory analysis of the ascitic fluid should include Gram stain, culture, and cell counts. A total leukocyte count of greater than 1000/mm3, or\ngreater than 250 neutrophils/mm3, is generally diagnostic of SBP since culture results are variably positive.

If it occurs before 37 weeks' gestation, it is termed preterm\npremature rupture of membranes (PPROM). Patients typically report a gush of fluid or steady leakage of fluid from the vagina. Initial evaluation includes a sterile speculum examination of the vagina, which\nmay show pooling of amniotic fluid or leakage of fluid from the cervical os. Nitrazine testing of the fluid will show a pH of 7.0 to 7.3, and terning will be seen on microscopic examination. Ultrasonography can\nalso be utilized to determine the amount of residual amniotic fluid, which would be decreased in the setting of the rupture of membranes. Risk factors include previous premature rupture of membranes, a\nvaginal or cervical infection, and cigarette smoking. Patients with PPROM are at increased risk for preterm delivery, as the rupture of membranes usually precipitates the onset of labor. Thus, these patients\nare treated with betamethasone to accelerate fetal lung maturity. Antibiotics are commonly administered prophylactically as a result of an increased risk for chorioamnionitis. The most likely complication in\nthis patient presenting with PPROM is preterm delivery.",

Acute chest syndrome (ACS)\noccurs as a result of vaso-occlusion within the pulmonary microvasculature and is diagnosed in patients with SCO who present with a new pulmonary infiltrate in the setting of fever or other new respiratory\nsymptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, increased work of breathing, tachypnea, or hypoxemia. ACS is a leading cause of mortality in patients with SCO. While ACS is a distinct clinical syndrome, it\nis commonly precipitated by another illness such as bacterial or viral pneumonia, asthma exacerbation with hypoventilation, or fat emboli. Plain film x-rays typically show segmental or subsegmental\nconsolidation, or a pleural effusion, with predilection for involvement of the lower lobes. It is both impractical and nearly impossible to distinguish ACS from bacterial pneumonia in patients with SCO. In\npatients with SCO who present with fever or ACS, obtaining blood cultures is essential to promptly identify bacteremia. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated immediately after blood cultures are\nobtained and should not be delayed pending further workup. Further treatment involves analgesia, maintaining normoxia with supplemental oxygen or the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation,\njudicious use of fluids, and aggressive pulmonary hygiene measures, including the use of an incentive spirometer.",

Disc herniation occurs most often following chronic disc degeneration combined with a minor traumatic event such as\nbending and lifting a heavy object causing an acute increase in the intradiscal pressure. Disc herniation typically presents as acute back pain along with symptoms of lumbosacral radiculopathy, including\nacute extremity pain and/or weakness in a dermalomal and myotomic distribution with respect to the impinged spinal nerve. Piriformis syndrome presents similarly but with pain reproduced with palpation of\nthe piriformis on the affected side. Regardless of cause, sciatica is diagnosed clinically, through a combination of history and examination maneuvers, including straight-leg raise testing, in which flexion of\nthe hip while the leg is held in extension at the knee reproduces pain in the lower back that generally shoots down the leg. Lumbar imaging with MRI or CT scan is useful for patients with severe motor or\nsensory dysfunction but is not required for most patients with mild or moderate symptoms without an objective neurologic deficit and in whom there is no concern for spinal cord impingement. Trial of\ntherapy is generally appropriate before imaging in such cases. Patients with evidence of muscular weakness may benefit from nerve conduction studies or electromyography.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by systemic inflammation that prominently affects synovial joints. It is chronic and progressive, often leading to significant morbidity.\nSymptoms include the gradual onset of symmetric arthralgia and joint swelling, as well as morning stiffness, commonly in the fingers and wrists. Chronic disease can progress to affect proximal joints and\nthe cervical spine and leads to significant Joint damage and deformities. Severe disease can cause systemic disease, such as interstitial lung disease, vasculitis, pleuritis, pericarditis, anemia, and\nsubcutaneous nodules. Atlantoaxial involvement is common in chronic disease and may be associated with subluxation with consequent spinal cord injury or radiculopathy. Evaluation of the cervical spine\nwith flexion and extension x-rays in patients with chronic RA is appropriate prior to general anesthesia, to evaluate for atlantoaxial instability and inform the technique for intubation. Direct laryngoscopy,\noften used to intubate patients for general anesthesia, involves significant neck extension and flexion, which could lead to catastrophic neurologic damage in the setting of atlantoaxial instability. With\nsignificant instability, intubation with in-line stabilization is needed. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management in this case is x-rays of the cervical spine to evaluate risk for direct\nlaryngoscopy.",

It may also occur in isolation and via nonspecific, random mutations and\nindividual point mutations that are de nova. VSOs are characterized by a holosystolic murmur best heard in the lower left sternal border and may have an associated palpable thrill. VSDs result in a left-to\nright shunt, which increases pulmonary blood flow. They are acyanotic lesions. If uncorrected, the increased pulmonary blood flow may result in pulmonary artery remodeling and consequent pulmonary\narterial hypertension, which may cause a reversal of the shunt from right to left. This process is referred to as Eisenmenger syndrome. Clinically, fatigue with feeding, sweating with feeding, hepatomegaly,\nand the presence of a murmur may be the only findings.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The rotator cuff is the group of muscles and tendons that act to seat the humeral head directly into the center of the glenoid during motion of the shoulder. These muscles also act in concert with other\nmuscles in the shoulder to internally and externally rotate, abduct, and adduct the shoulder. These muscles include the subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. The prime movements of\nthese muscles at the glenohumeral joint include internal rotation (subscapularis), external rotation (teres minor and infraspinatus), and abduction (supraspinatus). The coupling and antagonistic action of\nthese muscles seats the humeral head in the glenoid and provides a stable pivot upon which the larger, more powerful muscles of the shoulder can act, such as the latissimus dorsi, deltoid, and pectoralis\nmajor. A rotator cuff tear typically occurs at the insertion of the tendons of the rotator cuff on the humeral head. Commonly, this occurs in the supraspinatus tendon; however, tears can occur in any of the\nrotator cuff tendons or at the myotendinous Junction. Risk factors for rotator cuff tears include heavy labor, repetitive overhead lifting, diabetes mellitus, and vascular disease. Chronic disease leading to\ntendon degeneration as well as acute or repetitive microtrauma are thought to contribute to eventual tendon failure. The classic presentation of a rotator cuff tear is with pain and weakness in one of the axes\nof motion corresponding with the associated rotator cuff muscle. Late manifestations of a tear include clinically appreciable atrophy of the corresponding muscle. MRI is typically indicated for patients with\nrotator cuff injury to delineate the extent of injury and to determine the need for or to plan for surgical intervention.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Excess free water consumption over a rapid period can lead to acute hyponatremia, which, if severe, may include neurologic manifestations including altered mental status, seizures, central nervous\nsystem herniation syndromes, coma, and death. Acute consumption of free water results in dilution of renal interstitial concentration gradients and limits concentrating ability. Resulting serum and urine\nabnormalities include hyponatremia, low serum osmolality, and low urine osmolality. Hyponatremia, if mild, does not generally cause symptoms or objective examination findings. Treatment of hyponatremia\ninvolves treatment of any underlying disease and gradual sodium correction, typically with fluid restriction in cases of psychogenic polydipsia or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. A safe rate\nof sodium correction is generally no more than 6 to 12 mEq/day. When hyponatremia is corrected too rapidly, extracellular sodium exerts osmotic pressure that leads to the rapid efflux of water from\nneurons, which can lead to demyelination. The pons is particularly vulnerable to demyelinating injury, and the rapid correction of hyponatremia can result in central pontine myelinolysis. In cases of acute,\nsevere hyponatremia with neurologic symptoms of consequence (eg, seizure, coma, herniation, altered mental status), correction with hypertonic saline is appropriate.",

Despite their high\npotential to lead to opioid use disorder and overdose death, opioid agonists are useful for the management of pain in certain situations, such as in the perioperative period, following trauma, and in the setting\nof cancer, which can produce severe, chronic pain that is often intractable to other modalities. Treatment with opioids typically employs mu opioid receptor agonists, such as morphine, oxycodone,\nhydromorphone, fentanyl, or methadone. Dose titration is often necessary after beginning initial therapy. Oral opioids are typically administered on a fixed, scheduled dose. Breakthrough or progressive pain\ncan be treated by increasing the scheduled dose, usually by at least 25%. The percentage increase in dosage is informed by the severity of pain and assessment of other comorbidities and risk factors for\noverdose. Patients with uncontrolled pain on high oral doses of opioids may benefit from transdermal patches or intravenous administration.",

Reduviidae insects are nocturnal and feed on sleeping human hosts. They are common in rural areas and\ninfest thatched roofs, cracks, or holes in poorly built housing. South American trypanosomiasis manifests with an early, acute stage characterized by mild, nonspecific symptoms of fever, malaise, and\nlymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, which can last for 1 to 2 months and resolve spontaneously. There may be mild swelling and erythema at the site of the bite, commonly on the eyelids or near the mouth.\nSouth American trypanosomiasis is typically curable if treatment is initiated promptly during the acute stage. If not detected or treated during the acute stage, chronic infection typically ensues, which is not\ncurable. Chronic South American trypanosomiasis is characterized by cardiac manifestations, including dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure, along with gastrointestinal\nmanifestations, such as constipation or megaesophagus, which can produce dysphagia, odynophagia, and weight loss. The diagnosis is confirmed with a variety of tests depending on the chronicity of\ninfection and may include peripheral blood smear to detect extracellular parasites, polymerase chain reaction test, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Physical examination may disclose crackles on auscultation of the lungs. Chest x-rays will show new bilateral pulmonary\ninfiltrates unrelated to cardiac dysfunction. The pathology is thought to be caused by activation of neutrophils in the pulmonary vasculature by antibodies in the transfused product, which leads lo the\nrelease of cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Risk factors for its development include patient risk factors, such as tobacco use, fluid overload, shock, and alcohol use disorder. Platelets, plasma, and\nwhole blood carry the greatest risk for causing TRALI.

The abrupt destruction of a large number of tumor cells results in interstitial and serum\nrelease of intracellular contents, manifesting as hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and hyperuricemia. Patients with TLS can present with fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, cardiac\ndysrhythmias, seizures, tetany, muscle cramps, or syncope, and are at risk for sudden death secondary to associated electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities. Purine nucleic acids are metabolized to\nhypoxanthine and xanthine, which are converted to uric acid by xanthine oxidase, resulting in hyperuricemia. Uric acid can crystallize in the renal tubules leading to nephropathy and acute kidney injury, or it\ncan deposit into the joints, leading to arthralgias (eg, gout). Patients undergoing induction chemotherapy should be monitored for TLS and treated prophylactically with aggressive intravenous hydration along\nwith allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, or rasburicase, a recombinant uric oxidase. Treatment of TLS involves supportive care and correction of electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities. Rasburicase is\nhelpful in the treatment of TLS. In patients with severe kidney injury and refractory electrolyte derangements, renal replacement therapy with dialysis may be indicated.",

It can cause chemical burns and ulcerations of the tongue, airway, and\nesophagus, resulting in strider, hoarseness, vomiting, and drooling. If severe, esophageal perforation can result, leading to leakage of gastrointestinal contents into the mediastinum. Treatment is initially\nfocused on supportive measures, including airway management and fluid resuscitation. Visible lesions in the oropharynx increase the likelihood of distal gastrointestinal lesions. Patients should be evaluated\nwith esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGO) to assess for visceral injury. For severe injuries, treatment involves corticosteroid administration, antibiotics, and potentially surgical intervention in cases of\nperforation.",

Other testing strategies include stool-based tests, such as fecal occult\nblood and fecal immunochemical (FIT) tests, and CT colonography. A variety of screening intervals are acceptable and recommended by national governing bodies, with many patients undergoing either\ncolonoscopy every 10 years, annual FIT screening, screening every 10 years with flexible sigmoidoscopy and FIT, or screening every 5 years with CT colonography. In the event that adenomatous polyps or\nearly stage colon cancer is identified, closer follow up may be necessary. Careful risk stratification should be performed based on colonoscopy results to determine an appropriate follow-up interval. This\npatient's colonoscopy shows a polyp with dysplasia, which places him at increased risk for colon cancer. Colonoscopy should be repeated in 3 years for patients with 5 to 10 tubular adenomas or sessile\npolyps less than 10 mm in diameter, one tubular adenoma or sessile polyp greater than 10 mm in diameter, multiple serrated sessile polyps, or adenomas or sessile polyps with dysplasia or with villous or\ntubulovillous histology that are completely removed.",

Risk factors for its development include obesity, tobacco use, diabetes mellitus,\nhypertension, hyperlipidemia, poor diet, and lack of exercise. Modifying these risk factors with lifestyle changes or medications can decrease the risk for development of coronary artery disease. However,\nmedications can be associated with adverse effects, and their initiation should be guided by the evaluation of risks and benefits in each individual patient. This patient has evidence of hyperlipidemia with\nincreased total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations. In general, if a patient's LDL-cholesterol concentration is below 190 mg/dl, the decision to start a statin, or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is\nbased on the 10-year cardiovascular disease risk. In a patient with a cardiovascular risk of less than 5%, the risks of a statin medication often outweigh the benefits. In contrast, if a patient's cardiovascular\nrisk is greater than 10%, starting a statin medication is indicated. Initiation of aspirin follows similar rationale, with the risks outweighing the benefit in those with a low cardiovascular risk. Therefore, while this\npatient has hyperlipidemia, no further intervention is indicated at this time.",

A low TSH concentration indicates a hyperfunctioning nodule. These are rarely malignant and do not require fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Thyroid\nultrasonography should also be performed, and, if the uptake scan was performed initially, fine-needle aspiration biopsy can be avoided. Subsequent workup and management are dependent upon the\nresults of the TSH measurement, ultrasound characteristics of the nodule, and results of the radioactive iodine uptake scan.",

Pericarditis classically presents with substernal chest pain, which is often pleuritic,\nworsens when lying down, and improves with leaning forward. II can occur in patients with inflammatory, infectious, or malignant conditions, such as viral infection, systemic lupus erythematosus,\ntuberculosis, or lymphoma, and can present as a complication of myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery. On examination, pericarditis is disclosed by a diastolic friction rub, described as a harsh sound\nheard in diastole. The condition is diagnosed clinically and supported by increased inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. ECG is characterized by diffuse ST\nsegment elevation and PR segment depression. If not treated, pericarditis can lead to the development of pericardia! effusions, which, if large and quickly accumulating, can result in cardiac tamponade.\nEchocardiography should be performed to assess for the presence of a pericardia! effusion, which may require pericardiocentesis for drainage, if large. Overall cardiac function (eg, ejection fraction) should\nalso be assessed if cardiac enzyme biomarkers are increased and if there is concern for concomitant myocarditis or heart failure. Treatment includes anti-inflammatory medications, such as indomethacin,\nglucocorticoids, and/or colchicine. Conditions with a similar presentation should also be ruled out, such as acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and aortic dissection.",

Vital signs may show tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension caused by severe dehydration. Laboratory studies\ntypically show metabolic acidosis, increased serum glucose, ketones, and catecholamines, and a high anion gap caused by the accumulation of unmeasured anions in the serum. Metabolic acidosis is\naccompanied by a decreased bicarbonate concentration in the serum, as bicarbonate is consumed in the neutralization of increased acidic molecules (hydrogen molecules) in the blood. Serum glucagon\nand catecholamine concentrations are typically increased, as both are lipogenic, thereby liberating lipids for metabolism to ketones and increasing response to acute physiologic stress.

Acute decreases in sodium\nconcentration may lead to neurologic symptoms, such as seizure and altered mental status caused by cerebral edema. Chronic hyponatremia, in contrast, leads to less severe symptoms, such as nausea,\nvomiting, lightheadedness, fatigue, and confusion. One well-known cause of significant hyponatremia is the initiation of diuretics, with other causes including kidney dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, volume\noverload, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. This patient was recently started on hydrochlorothiazide, shortly after which her symptoms began, making her hyponatremia most\nlikely secondary to thiazide diuretic use. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy is discontinuation of hydrochlorothiazide.",

The emotional disturbance manifests as marked distress out of proportion to the stressor and a\nsignificant impairment in daily school, work, or social functioning. Patients may internalize or externalize their distress, resulting in symptoms of depression and/or anxiety symptoms, or conduct disturbances\n(eg, acting out), respectively. Patients with adjustment disorder do not meet criteria for anxiety, major depressive, or conduct disorders. This patient demonstrates some anxiety and/or depression symptoms\n(eg, irritability, loss of interest) and conduct disturbances (eg, skipping cardiac rehabilitation sessions) with a prior identifiable stressor and without meeting the criteria for anxiety, major depressive, or\nconduct disorders.

In the setting of trauma, hyphema occurs as a consequence of damage to the AC angle, iris root, or ciliary body, which are richly vascularized. Immediate and subacute complications of\nhyphema include ocular hypertension, which may lead to glaucomatous optic nerve damage, rebleeding, and corneal blood staining. Corneal blood staining may significantly impair visual acuity and may\nnecessitate corneal transplantation if the central cornea is involved. Chronic complications of hyphema are primarily related to glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve. Hyphema is particularly dangerous in\npatients with sickle cell disease or trait because of the complications of red blood cell (RSC) sickling. Sickled RBCs in the AC are less likely to be filtered through the trabecular meshwork and are likely to\nresult in ocular hypertension. Ocular hypertension may then induce sickling of RBCs in retinal vasculature, leading to irreversible vision loss through induction of retinal arterial or venous occlusions. Most\nhyphemas may be managed medically through topical drops to lower ocular pressure. In patients with sickle cell disease or trait, surgical AC washout is indicated if intraocular pressure is not controlled\nwithin 24 hours.

Risk factors for development include exogenous estrogen use, family history of breast cancer, genetic mutation (eg, BRCA 1 or 2), early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity, obesity, and\nAfrican American ethnicity. In patients over age 30 years with a palpable breast mass or axillary lymphadenopathy, mammography should be the first step in diagnosis. Other radiologic evaluation may\ninclude ultrasonography to identify a lesion suitable for biopsy. However, regardless of imaging findings, biopsy should occur if the physical examination is concerning for breast cancer, as ii is in this patient.\nFine-needle aspiration only has a sensitivity of approximately 74%, as not all samples obtained are adequate for diagnosis. Thus, this patient, with a high-risk lesion on physical examination, should undergo\na more sensitive diagnostic evaluation with excisional biopsy, which would remove the whole mass for analysis, and may be curative if disease remains confined to the lesion.",

The radial nerve supplies motor fibers to the triceps brachii and the extensor muscles within the posterior compartment of the forearm,\nand sensory fibers to the dorsum of the forearm, wrist, and hand. It does not innervate the intrinsic muscles of the hand. It is prone to injury with midshaft humerus fractures, as it runs near the humeral\ndiaphysis within the spiral groove. Injury to the nerve presents with loss of function of structures distal to the injury. In the case of this patient, the weakness of the wrist and finger extensors suggests injury\nwithin the axilla or arm.

If a pneumothorax is large, tube\nthoracostomy should be performed to evacuate the air in the pleural space to aid in lung re-expansion. Once a chest tube is placed and healing of the inciting injury occurs, leakage of air into the pleural\nspace should stop. If a persistent air leak is noted, the source of the leak should be investigated. A ruptured bronchus requires extended time to heal and is a potential source of air leak.

Signs\nand symptoms include petechiae, purpura, mucosa! bleeding, menorrhagia, and prolonged bleeding from minor injuries. The underlying cause is incompletely understood but involves formation of antiplatelet\nlgG antibodies with subsequent platelet opsonization and phagocytosis by splenic macrophages. The diagnosis is one of exclusion after other potential causes of thrombocytopenia, such as viral infection,\nhematologic malignancy, and adverse effects of medication have been ruled out. Bone marrow biopsy will most likely show an increased number of megakaryocytes indicating adequate platelet production\nbut increased peripheral destruction of platelets. Platelets appear normal on peripheral blood smear. Coagulation studies are also normal, although bleeding lime is prolonged. ITP often occurs following an\ninfection, frequently with Helicobacter pylori, Epstein-Barr virus, or HIV, and is generally self-limited. Chronic ITP is first treated with steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or immunomodulatory drugs.\nRefractory ITP is treated with splenectomy, which results in remission of thrombocytopenia in most cases.",

Premature delivery in early pregnancy results in stillbirth caused by incomplete development of the\nneonatal lungs and brain, which do not complete their maturation until the end of the second trimester. The diagnosis of death in newborns requires a careful examination, which may be complicated by the\nfact that many reflexes are not fully developed, and ocular examination (as well as examination of corneal, vestibular, and oculocephalic reflexes) may be impossible. Apnea testing is a reliable method for\ndiagnosing death and involves providing adequate oxygenation via ventilator, followed by observation of a rise in carbon dioxide levels caused by lack of spontaneous respirations as the ventilator is\nweaned. EEG is not usually necessary, but, if performed, demonstrates electrocerebral silence, or lack of electrical waveforms. In the setting of death in a nonviable, premature newborn, it is appropriate to\ndiscontinue resuscitative efforts. Generally, any fetus of less than gestational age 22 to 23 weeks (depending on the particular center caring for the child) will be nonviable, and resuscitation efforts would be\ninappropriate.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "While randomized controlled trials form the gold standard of medical research and generate more powerful evidence than other forms of observational or descriptive studies, they remain susceptible to\nerror. A common form of error results from limitations in the number of study participants, which in turn limits statistical power, or the ability of the study to detect a difference between groups if one exists.\nIncreasing the power of a study can generally be completed through a larger sample size and improving precision in measurements. When the power of a study is increased, the incidence of a type II error\ndecreases. A type II error occurs when a study demonstrates no difference between the null and alternative hypotheses, when in fact, a difference exists. The type II error rate is calculated by subtracting\nthe power from 100%. A meta-analysis is a form of study in which statistical analysis is performed lo combine the results of multiple studies addressing the same question. Meta-analysis is useful for\novercoming limitations of the constituent studies within the meta-analysis. By pooling the results of multiple studies, meta-analyses reduce the risk for type II error caused by the smaller sample sizes within\neach constituent randomized controlled trial. However, meta-analyses are susceptible to their own errors, primarily related to inclusion criteria, statistical methods, and the errors of constituent studies.",

SCFE is a displacement of the femoral epiphysis relative lo the femoral\nneck secondary to anterosuperior movement of the metaphysis. It is a Salter-Harris type 1 fracture of the growth plate. SCFE typically presents with a painful limp and, if severe, may result in restricted range\nof motion of the hip joint (eg, limited abduction and internal rotation of the hip as in this case) and inability to bear weight on the affected lower extremity. Pain often refers to the knee and thigh. X-ray\nevaluation of both hips in frontal and frog-leg views permits side-by-side comparison to diagnose the condition. If untreated, complications include avascular necrosis of the femoral head, limited range of\nmotion and gait impairment, and premature osteoarthritis.

Symptoms include the rapid onset of bronchospasm with dyspnea or wheezing, urticaria, flushing, nausea and emesis, edematous lips and tongue, and\nhypotension with tachycardia. When severe and untreated, ii can progress to circulatory collapse with cardiovascular arrest or death caused by asphyxiation and airway obstruction. Treatment includes the\nadministration of epinephrine, antihistamines, bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids, as well as intravenous fluids. Severe cases may require endotracheal intubation and the administration of vasopressors.\nPatients with a history of atopy, such as asthma and eczema, and a history of medication allergies are at increased risk for anaphylaxis.

Calcium-containing stones are the most common varieties, although renal calculi may also be composed of cystine, struvite, and uric acid. While abdominal plain x-rays were traditionally used for\ndiagnosis, urate stones are radiolucent, and given the availability and sensitivity of advanced imaging, a noncontrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is now the preferred imaging modality for definitive\ndiagnosis. One exception to this is in pediatrics, where imaging modalities that involve less radiation, such as ultrasonography and x-ray, are often used before modalities such as CT. Acute management\ndepends on the size and location of the calculi in addition to complicating factors such as abnormal anatomy or the concurrent presence of a urinary tract infection.

Patients with\nmyasthenia gravis possess antibodies that block or destroy nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which interferes with neuromuscular Junction signaling. Many patients with myasthenia gravis have\nthymic hyperplasia or thymoma. In myasthenia gravis, the thymus, which is the site of T-lymphocyte maturation, may show abnormalities in the presentation of the nAChR as an antigen to helper T\nlymphocytes. This abnormal antigen presentation is postulated to result in autoimmune attack of the nAChR on skeletal muscle cells. Patients present with progressively worsening skeletal muscle weakness\nat rest and fatigability on activation in focal or generalized muscle groups. Thus, nerve conduction studies with repetitive stimulation are used to confirm the diagnosis. The ocular, bulbar, and neck muscles\nare commonly affected. Most concerningly, respiratory muscle weakness can lead to respiratory insufficiency, and in an acute flare, these patients may require mechanical ventilation. Management includes\nsymptomatic treatments such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors along with immune modulating therapies. In patients with or without thymoma, complete thymectomy may be curative.",

It may be caused by rare congenital conditions, but most cases are secondary to a noncongenital condition. Of these, pulmonary pathology is the most\ncommon cause. The pathophysiology is associated with hypoxemia-related changes in systemic growth factor regulation. Other causes include primary cardiac, gastrointestinal, or hepatic disease, as well as\nmetastatic malignancy. Patients present with debilitating arthralgia which is often initially diagnosed as inflammatory arthritis. However, for this patient, the finding of a lung mass with regional\nlymphadenopathy makes secondary HOA as a result of pulmonary malignancy the most likely diagnosis.",

Risk factors include male sex, older age, tobacco use, hypertension,\nhyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease, all of which are seen in this patient. Symptoms can vary, with some patients being asymptomatic. When present, however, symptoms include a pulsatile groin\nmass and vascular claudication. Femoral artery aneurysms can be complicated by acute limb ischemia, rupture, or distal embolism. Diagnosis often includes duplex ultrasonography of the groin or CT\nangiography. Symptomatic patients or those with large (2 3 cm) aneurysms should undergo surgical arterial repair. This patient with numerous cardiovascular risk factors presents with third toe ischemia\nmost likely caused by thromboembolism in the setting of a pulsatile groin mass felt on physical examination. This pulsatile mass can be more clearly seen as an enlarged femoral artery with intraluminal\nthrombus on CT scan. Thus, the most appropriate next step in management of this patient is surgical arterial repair.",

Potential complications of SBO include bowel rupture and/or necrosis, which can result in sudden-onset peritoneal abdominal signs, such as rebound tenderness and guarding. Abdominal x\nrays typically show dilated small bowel loops and can also have multiple air-fluid levels.

As specificity increases, the false\npositive rate decreases. A highly specific test allows the clinician and the patient to be confident that a positive test confirms the presence of disease. A test with poor specificity, if positive, does not provide\nstrong evidence or confidence that the patient does, in fact, have the disease. In contrast, sensitivity is the ability of a test to detect a disease if it is present. A test is described as sensitive if it has a high\nlikelihood of disease detection, and therefore a low likelihood of a false negative (Type 2 error). High sensitivity is useful in ruling out a disease. In the study described, a hemoglobin A1c greater than 15%\nwas present in 12% (false positive rate) and not present in 88% (true negative rate) of patients without diabetic retinopathy.",

The thyroid gland is situated anterior to the trachea and consists of two lobes\nthat are connected by a smaller isthmus. The thyroid is located near a variety of vascular and neurologic structures. The recurrent laryngeal nerves run posteriorly to the two lobes bilaterally. They provide\nmuscle innervation for both abduction and adduction of the vocal cords, as well as sensation to the region below the glottis. Special care is taken to identify these nerves during thyroidectomy to avoid nerve\ninjury, often with direct intraoperative nerve monitoring. Unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis can lead to voice hoarseness caused by the inability to abduct the vocal cord on one side, whereas\nbilateral paralysis can lead to airway obstruction as both vocal cords remain in a medial position. This patient has respiratory distress with audible stridor, indicating an upper airway obstruction, the likelihood\nof which is further reinforced by decreased breath sounds bilaterally caused by poor air movement through the obstruction. Given the onset of this patient's symptoms immediately after surgery, the most\nlikely cause of this presentation is bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis leading to vocal cord paralysis and airway obstruction.",

Inadequately treated pain can lead to hypertension and patient dissatisfaction as well as delayed recovery caused by\ndecreased ambulation and increased hospital length of stay. This can be exceptionally challenging in patients taking opioids prior to surgery as they often have an increased tolerance to opioids and require\nlarger doses than the opioid-naive patient. The classic approach to perioperative pain control includes a multimodal technique, including acetaminophen, local anesthetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\ndrugs, and oral and intravenous opioids. Patient-controlled analgesia is a method of providing pain control frequently used in the opioid-tolerant population or for those with significant postoperative pain. It\ninvolves programming a pump to deliver a small bolus dose of parenteral opioid in response to the patient pressing a button with a lockout interval and maximum dose to prevent overdose. This allows the\npatient to control the frequency of analgesic medication rather than be reliant on the nurse for pain medication distribution and improves patient satisfaction. Additionally, it allows the practitioner to calculate\na total opioid requirement that may be utilized to transition the patient to an effective oral regimen. This patient has hypertension likely related to his ongoing significant pain in the setting of previous opioid\nuse, given that his blood pressure improves after pain medication administration. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to improve his hypertension should be aimed at treating his pain.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by abnormalities in chloride ion transport that causes thickened secretions in a variety of organ systems, most notably the respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal\nsystem. This leads to the common presenting symptoms of recurrent pneumonia, sinusitis, pancreatic insufficiency, and pancreatitis. Most cystic fibrosis cases are diagnosed on neonatal screening\nperformed shortly after birth. Malnutrition is common in patients with cystic fibrosis, as their pancreatic insufficiency causes inadequate absorption of protein, fat, and vitamins. This patient has signs of long\nterm malnutrition, such as small stature and low BMI. This malnutrition is likely to be worsened in pregnancy as her nutritional requirements increase to provide the developing fetus with appropriate\nnutrients. Thus, she is most likely to require nutritional supplementation during her pregnancy to prevent complications such as fetal growth restriction.",

Leukocytosis is common on laboratory examination, and\nevaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid will show an increased white blood cell count with predominant neutrophils, increased protein, and decreased glucose. Thorough evaluation also includes a complete\nblood count, blood culture, and urine culture to evaluate for other causes of sepsis, as well as culture of the cerebrospinal fluid to determine the causative organism. Common causes of neonatal meningitis\ninclude Escherichia coli, Streptococcus aga/actiae, and Listeria monocytogenes. Based on age though, alternative bacterial pathogens should be considered. Haemophilus influenzae commonly causes\nmeningitis in children aged 6 months to 6 years, especially unvaccinated children.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Cholestatic hepatic disease is identified by a disproportionate rise in bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase compared to AST and ALT. Cholestasis is accompanied by Jaundice, visible at a bilirubin concentration\nof 2 mg/dL or greater, and pruritus. Biliary motility is triggered by oral intake and neurohormonal control stimulated in part by feeding and gastric motility. A lack of oral intake, such as in cases of total\nparenteral nutrition (TPN), with resultant limited gastric emptying will also cause limited biliary drainage and limited gallbladder contractility. In addition, TPN can cause bile duct inflammation, fibrosis, and\nbiliary obstruction, which describes the clinical picture of cholestasis. TPN-induced cholestasis is more common in patients with a short bowel. Cholestasis is defined by increased indirect and/or direct\nbilirubin caused by the inability to excrete bilirubin. Typically, liver transaminases and alkaline phosphatase concentrations are not increased. Management of this condition involves discontinuing TPN and\nproviding enteral feeding.",

Preeclampsia is\ncaused by an abnormality of the placental spiral arteries and poor trophoblastic invasion, which leads to placental hypoperfusion and the subsequent production of vasoactive hormones that cause\ngeneralized endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, and vasospasm. Preeclampsia may lead to uteroplacental insufficiency that puts the fetus at risk for fetal growth restriction. If untreated, preeclampsia\ncan progress to eclampsia, characterized by maternal seizures, which can have profoundly adverse outcomes. Additionally, preeclampsia increases the risk for abruptio placentae, or premature separation of\nthe placenta from the uterus, which can lead to fetal exsanguination. Abruptio placentae most commonly presents with vaginal bleeding, severe uterine pain, and tetanic contractions. Thus, the most likely\ncomplication during labor for this patient is abruptio placentae based on her underlying preeclampsia.",

The disease\nusually presents with an insidious onset of psychiatric (eg, irritability, depression, psychosis) and cognitive symptoms. Motor symptoms (eg, chorea, hypotonia, dystonia, loss of voluntary control of\nmovements) typically appear later in the disease course. People with HD typically die 10 to 40 years after disease onset. Chorea, a key HD symptom, can be initially experienced as restlessness. Chorea is\ndistinguished by irregular, unpredictable muscle movements that tend to flow from one muscle group to another. Treatment is symptomatic and can include tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine, which target\nchorea by depleting dopamine stores. HD is caused by expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (CAG) on chromosome 4, which occurs when a series of three nucleotides in repetition are replicated incorrectly\nand too many repeats are included in the replicated product. HD also demonstrates anticipation, a genetic inheritance phenomenon in which future generations are affected at a younger age or with more\nsevere symptoms.",

If it occurs before 37 weeks' gestation, it is termed preterm\npremature rupture of membranes (PPROM). Patients typically report a gush of fluid or steady leakage of fluid from the vagina. Initial evaluation includes a sterile speculum examination of the vagina, which\nmay show pooling of amniotic fluid or leakage of fluid from the cervical os. Nitrazine testing of the fluid will show a pH of 7.0 to 7.3, and terning will be seen on microscopic examination. Ultrasonography can\nalso be utilized to determine the amount of residual amniotic fluid, which would be decreased in the setting of the rupture of membranes. Risk factors include previous premature rupture of membranes, a\nvaginal or cervical infection, and cigarette smoking. Patients with PPROM are at increased risk for preterm delivery, as the rupture of membranes usually precipitates the onset of labor. Thus, these patients\nare treated with betamethasone to accelerate fetal lung maturity. Antibiotics are commonly administered prophylactically as a result of an increased risk for chorioamnionitis. The most likely complication in\nthis patient presenting with PPROM is preterm delivery.",

Acute chest syndrome (ACS)\noccurs as a result of vaso-occlusion within the pulmonary microvasculature and is diagnosed in patients with SCO who present with a new pulmonary infiltrate in the setting of fever or other new respiratory\nsymptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, increased work of breathing, tachypnea, or hypoxemia. ACS is a leading cause of mortality in patients with SCO. While ACS is a distinct clinical syndrome, it\nis commonly precipitated by another illness such as bacterial or viral pneumonia, asthma exacerbation with hypoventilation, or fat emboli. Plain film x-rays typically show segmental or subsegmental\nconsolidation, or a pleural effusion, with predilection for involvement of the lower lobes. It is both impractical and nearly impossible to distinguish ACS from bacterial pneumonia in patients with SCO. In\npatients with SCO who present with fever or ACS, obtaining blood cultures is essential to promptly identify bacteremia. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated immediately after blood cultures are\nobtained and should not be delayed pending further workup. Further treatment involves analgesia, maintaining normoxia with supplemental oxygen or the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation,\njudicious use of fluids, and aggressive pulmonary hygiene measures, including the use of an incentive spirometer.",

Disc herniation occurs most often following chronic disc degeneration combined with a minor traumatic event such as\nbending and lifting a heavy object causing an acute increase in the intradiscal pressure. Disc herniation typically presents as acute back pain along with symptoms of lumbosacral radiculopathy, including\nacute extremity pain and/or weakness in a dermalomal and myotomic distribution with respect to the impinged spinal nerve. Piriformis syndrome presents similarly but with pain reproduced with palpation of\nthe piriformis on the affected side. Regardless of cause, sciatica is diagnosed clinically, through a combination of history and examination maneuvers, including straight-leg raise testing, in which flexion of\nthe hip while the leg is held in extension at the knee reproduces pain in the lower back that generally shoots down the leg. Lumbar imaging with MRI or CT scan is useful for patients with severe motor or\nsensory dysfunction but is not required for most patients with mild or moderate symptoms without an objective neurologic deficit and in whom there is no concern for spinal cord impingement. Trial of\ntherapy is generally appropriate before imaging in such cases. Patients with evidence of muscular weakness may benefit from nerve conduction studies or electromyography. Most patients with sciatica\ndemonstrate spontaneous improvement with conservative management, including analgesia, physical therapy, and activity as tolerated.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by systemic inflammation that prominently affects synovial joints. It is chronic and progressive, often leading to significant morbidity.\nSymptoms include the gradual onset of symmetric arthralgia and joint swelling, as well as morning stiffness, commonly in the fingers and wrists. Chronic disease can progress to affect proximal joints and\nthe cervical spine and leads to significant Joint damage and deformities. Severe disease can cause systemic disease, such as interstitial lung disease, vasculitis, pleuritis, pericarditis, anemia, and\nsubcutaneous nodules. Atlantoaxial involvement is common in chronic disease and may be associated with subluxation with consequent spinal cord injury or radiculopathy. Evaluation of the cervical spine\nwith flexion and extension x-rays in patients with chronic RA is appropriate prior to general anesthesia, to evaluate for atlantoaxial instability and inform the technique for intubation. Direct laryngoscopy,\noften used to intubate patients for general anesthesia, involves significant neck extension and flexion, which could lead to catastrophic neurologic damage in the setting of atlantoaxial instability. With\nsignificant instability, intubation with in-line stabilization is needed. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management in this case is x-rays of the cervical spine to evaluate risk for direct\nlaryngoscopy.",

VSOs are characterized by a holosystolic murmur best heard in the lower left sternal border and may have an associated palpable thrill. VSDs result in a left-to\nright shunt, which increases pulmonary blood flow. They are acyanotic lesions. If uncorrected, the increased pulmonary blood flow may result in pulmonary artery remodeling and consequent pulmonary\narterial hypertension, which may cause a reversal of the shunt from right to left. This process is referred to as Eisenmenger syndrome. Clinically, fatigue with feeding, sweating with feeding, hepatomegaly,\nand the presence of a murmur may be the only findings.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "The rotator cuff is the group of muscles and tendons that act to seat the humeral head directly into the center of the glenoid during motion of the shoulder. These muscles also act in concert with other\nmuscles in the shoulder to internally and externally rotate, abduct, and adduct the shoulder. These muscles include the subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. The prime movements of\nthese muscles at the glenohumeral joint include internal rotation (subscapularis), external rotation (teres minor and infraspinatus), and abduction (supraspinatus). The coupling and antagonistic action of\nthese muscles seats the humeral head in the glenoid and provides a stable pivot upon which the larger, more powerful muscles of the shoulder can act, such as the latissimus dorsi, deltoid, and pectoralis\nmajor. A rotator cuff tear typically occurs at the insertion of the tendons of the rotator cuff on the humeral head. Commonly, this occurs in the supraspinatus tendon; however, tears can occur in any of the\nrotator cuff tendons or at the myotendinous Junction. Risk factors for rotator cuff tears include heavy labor, repetitive overhead lifting, diabetes mellitus, and vascular disease. Chronic disease leading to\ntendon degeneration as well as acute or repetitive microtrauma are thought to contribute to eventual tendon failure. The classic presentation of a rotator cuff tear is with pain and weakness in one of the axes\nof motion corresponding with the associated rotator cuff muscle. Late manifestations of a tear include clinically appreciable atrophy of the corresponding muscle. MRI is typically indicated for patients with\nrotator cuff injury to delineate the extent of injury and to determine the need for or to plan for surgical intervention.",

Acute consumption of free water results in dilution of renal interstitial concentration gradients and limits concentrating ability. Resulting serum and urine\nabnormalities include hyponatremia, low serum osmolality, and low urine osmolality. Hyponatremia, if mild, does not generally cause symptoms or objective examination findings. Treatment of hyponatremia\ninvolves treatment of any underlying disease and gradual sodium correction, typically with fluid restriction in cases of psychogenic polydipsia or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. A safe rate\nof sodium correction is generally no more than 6 to 12 mEq/day. When hyponatremia is corrected too rapidly, extracellular sodium exerts osmotic pressure that leads to the rapid efflux of water from\nneurons, which can lead to demyelination. The pons is particularly vulnerable to demyelinating injury, and the rapid correction of hyponatremia can result in central pontine myelinolysis. In cases of acute,\nsevere hyponatremia with neurologic symptoms of consequence (eg, seizure, coma, herniation, altered mental status), correction with hypertonic saline is appropriate.",

Treatment with opioids typically employs mu opioid receptor agonists, such as morphine, oxycodone,\nhydromorphone, fentanyl, or methadone. Dose titration is often necessary after beginning initial therapy. Oral opioids are typically administered on a fixed, scheduled dose. Breakthrough or progressive pain\ncan be treated by increasing the scheduled dose, usually by at least 25%. The percentage increase in dosage is informed by the severity of pain and assessment of other comorbidities and risk factors for\noverdose.

Allergenic triggers can be more difficult to control, especially in indoor environments. The most common indoor allergens are dust mites, pets, and molds. This\npatient has noticed an association between her asthma symptoms and being indoors around cats. Skin testing confirms her hypersensitivity to dust mites and cat dander. One of the most effective proven\nstrategies for minimizing dust mite exposure is the use of an allergen-impermeable mattress and pillow covers.

Reduviidae insects are nocturnal and feed on sleeping human hosts. They are common in rural areas and\ninfest thatched roofs, cracks, or holes in poorly built housing. South American trypanosomiasis manifests with an early, acute stage characterized by mild, nonspecific symptoms of fever, malaise, and\nlymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, which can last for 1 to 2 months and resolve spontaneously. There may be mild swelling and erythema at the site of the bite, commonly on the eyelids or near the mouth.\nSouth American trypanosomiasis is typically curable if treatment is initiated promptly during the acute stage. If not detected or treated during the acute stage, chronic infection typically ensues, which is not\ncurable. Chronic South American trypanosomiasis is characterized by cardiac manifestations, including dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure, along with gastrointestinal\nmanifestations, such as constipation or megaesophagus, which can produce dysphagia, odynophagia, and weight loss. The diagnosis is confirmed with a variety of tests depending on the chronicity of\ninfection and may include peripheral blood smear to detect extracellular parasites, polymerase chain reaction test, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

The abrupt destruction of a large number of tumor cells results in interstitial and serum\nrelease of intracellular contents, manifesting as hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and hyperuricemia. Patients with TLS can present with fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, cardiac\ndysrhythmias, seizures, tetany, muscle cramps, or syncope, and are at risk for sudden death secondary to associated electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities. Purine nucleic acids are metabolized to\nhypoxanthine and xanthine, which are converted to uric acid by xanthine oxidase, resulting in hyperuricemia. Uric acid can crystallize in the renal tubules leading to nephropathy and acute kidney injury, or it\ncan deposit into the joints, leading to arthralgias (eg, gout). Patients undergoing induction chemotherapy should be monitored for TLS and treated prophylactically with aggressive intravenous hydration along\nwith allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, or rasburicase, a recombinant uric oxidase. Treatment of TLS involves supportive care and correction of electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities. Rasburicase is\nhelpful in the treatment of TLS. In patients with severe kidney injury and refractory electrolyte derangements, renal replacement therapy with dialysis may be indicated.",

They contain hydroxides, alkali that are proton\nacceptors and strong nucleophiles. Alkali ingestion leads to liquefactive necrosis, lactic acidosis, and tissue penetration and ulceration. It can cause chemical burns and ulcerations of the tongue, airway, and\nesophagus, resulting in strider, hoarseness, vomiting, and drooling. If severe, esophageal perforation can result, leading to leakage of gastrointestinal contents into the mediastinum. Treatment is initially\nfocused on supportive measures, including airway management and fluid resuscitation. Visible lesions in the oropharynx increase the likelihood of distal gastrointestinal lesions. Patients should be evaluated\nwith esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGO) to assess for visceral injury. For severe injuries, treatment involves corticosteroid administration, antibiotics, and potentially surgical intervention in cases of\nperforation.",

Colonoscopy remains the gold standard screening test as it allows direct visualization and excision of polyps\nthroughout the length of the colon. Other direct visualization tests such as flexible sigmoidoscopy may be acceptable for some patients. Other testing strategies include stool-based tests, such as fecal occult\nblood and fecal immunochemical (FIT) tests, and CT colonography. A variety of screening intervals are acceptable and recommended by national governing bodies, with many patients undergoing either\ncolonoscopy every 10 years, annual FIT screening, screening every 10 years with flexible sigmoidoscopy and FIT, or screening every 5 years with CT colonography. In the event that adenomatous polyps or\nearly stage colon cancer is identified, closer follow up may be necessary. Careful risk stratification should be performed based on colonoscopy results to determine an appropriate follow-up interval. This\npatient's colonoscopy shows a polyp with dysplasia, which places him at increased risk for colon cancer. Colonoscopy should be repeated in 3 years for patients with 5 to 10 tubular adenomas or sessile\npolyps less than 10 mm in diameter, one tubular adenoma or sessile polyp greater than 10 mm in diameter, multiple serrated sessile polyps, or adenomas or sessile polyps with dysplasia or with villous or\ntubulovillous histology that are completely removed.",

In contrast, internal validity describes the ability of a study to attribute its findings to the cause-effect relationship under study, while also\nexcluding alternative explanations for the observations. While rigorous experimental design and standardized procedures are important for establishing internal validity, choices that affect experimental\ndesign may result in poor generalizability or external validity. In this scenario, choosing to sample only patients who present to the emergency department while a study nurse is present during the day\nensures that there is standardization of care but creates sampling bias that limits generalizability, since patients in the population at large also present at night.",

Pericarditis classically presents with substernal chest pain, which is often pleuritic,\nworsens when lying down, and improves with leaning forward. II can occur in patients with inflammatory, infectious, or malignant conditions, such as viral infection, systemic lupus erythematosus,\ntuberculosis, or lymphoma, and can present as a complication of myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery. On examination, pericarditis is disclosed by a diastolic friction rub, described as a harsh sound\nheard in diastole. The condition is diagnosed clinically and supported by increased inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. ECG is characterized by diffuse ST\nsegment elevation and PR segment depression. If not treated, pericarditis can lead to the development of pericardia! effusions, which, if large and quickly accumulating, can result in cardiac tamponade.\nEchocardiography should be performed to assess for the presence of a pericardia! effusion, which may require pericardiocentesis for drainage, if large. Overall cardiac function (eg, ejection fraction) should\nalso be assessed if cardiac enzyme biomarkers are increased and if there is concern for concomitant myocarditis or heart failure. Treatment includes anti-inflammatory medications, such as indomethacin,\nglucocorticoids, and/or colchicine. Conditions with a similar presentation should also be ruled out, such as acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and aortic dissection.",

It occurs as\na result of the accumulation of serum ketones such as r..-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone in the setting of insulin deficiency. Dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis\noccurs as a result of the relative state of starvation created by absent insulin signaling. Vital signs may show tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension caused by severe dehydration. Laboratory studies\ntypically show metabolic acidosis, increased serum glucose, ketones, and catecholamines, and a high anion gap caused by the accumulation of unmeasured anions in the serum. Metabolic acidosis is\naccompanied by a decreased bicarbonate concentration in the serum, as bicarbonate is consumed in the neutralization of increased acidic molecules (hydrogen molecules) in the blood. Serum glucagon\nand catecholamine concentrations are typically increased, as both are lipogenic, thereby liberating lipids for metabolism to ketones and increasing response to acute physiologic stress. Treatment includes\nreplacement of insulin, volume repletion, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions.",

This displacement limits the classic history\nand physical examination, which rely on a right lower quadrant position of the appendix. When displaced cephalad, parietal peritoneal inflammation may no longer occur at the McBurney point, even\nmigrating as cephalad as the right upper quadrant, mimicking diagnoses such as cholecystitis. Diagnosis is facilitated by CT scan (though less ideal in pregnancy due to the risk for teratogenicity to the\nfetus), MRI, or ultrasonography, which may show appendiceal enlargement, the presence of an appendicolith, appendiceal wall thickening, or periappendiceal fluid or fat stranding. Fetal heart tracings are\nusually reassuring unless maternal hemodynamics have been compromised, and fetal tachycardia may result from response to maternal fever.

In the setting of trauma, hyphema occurs as a consequence of damage to the AC angle, iris root, or ciliary body, which are richly vascularized. Immediate and subacute complications of\nhyphema include ocular hypertension, which may lead to glaucomatous optic nerve damage, rebleeding, and corneal blood staining. Corneal blood staining may significantly impair visual acuity and may\nnecessitate corneal transplantation if the central cornea is involved. Chronic complications of hyphema are primarily related to glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve. Hyphema is particularly dangerous in\npatients with sickle cell disease or trait because of the complications of red blood cell (RSC) sickling. Sickled RBCs in the AC are less likely to be filtered through the trabecular meshwork and are likely to\nresult in ocular hypertension. Ocular hypertension may then induce sickling of RBCs in retinal vasculature, leading to irreversible vision loss through induction of retinal arterial or venous occlusions. Most\nhyphemas may be managed medically through topical drops to lower ocular pressure. In patients with sickle cell disease or trait, surgical AC washout is indicated if intraocular pressure is not controlled\nwithin 24 hours. In contrast, patients without sickle cell disease or trait may tolerate high intraocular pressure for up to 5 days before surgical washout may be considered.",

Risk factors for development include exogenous estrogen use, family history of breast cancer, genetic mutation (eg, BRCA 1 or 2), early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity, obesity, and\nAfrican American ethnicity. In patients over age 30 years with a palpable breast mass or axillary lymphadenopathy, mammography should be the first step in diagnosis. Other radiologic evaluation may\ninclude ultrasonography to identify a lesion suitable for biopsy. However, regardless of imaging findings, biopsy should occur if the physical examination is concerning for breast cancer, as ii is in this patient.\nFine-needle aspiration only has a sensitivity of approximately 74%, as not all samples obtained are adequate for diagnosis. Thus, this patient, with a high-risk lesion on physical examination, should undergo\na more sensitive diagnostic evaluation with excisional biopsy, which would remove the whole mass for analysis, and may be curative if disease remains confined to the lesion.",

The evaluation of infertility often includes a history and physical examination, as well as laboratory evaluation, imaging studies, and, potentially,\nlaparoscopy. Common causes of infertility include ovulatory dysfunction and endometriosis. Congenital structural uterine abnormalities, as seen in this patient, can lead to infertility. A bicornuate uterus is\ncaused by failure of the paramesonephric (m~llerian) ducts to fully fuse, resulting in two completely or partially separate uterine cavities. Because of this, there is a diminished area for egg implantation, as\nwell as placental and fetal development, which predisposes the patient to infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss. A bicornuate uterus also increases the risk for preterm delivery, fetal growth restriction, and\nmalpresentation.

Severe bleeding from placenta previa may lead to hemorrhagic shock, and treatment involves delivery with cesarean section. This patient is not at\nincreased risk for placenta previa.\nUterine rupture (Choice E) is a dangerous obstetric complication where the uterine wall tears, presenting with acute pain and both maternal and fetal hemodynamic instability.

Infertility can be\nprimary in patients who have never conceived, or secondary in patients who had previous conceptions. Regardless, it is defined as the inability of a couple to conceive after 12 months of regular intercourse,\nor after 6 months of intercourse in women over age 35 years. The evaluation of infertility often includes a history and physical examination, as well as laboratory evaluation, imaging studies, and, potentially,\nlaparoscopy. Common causes of infertility include ovulatory dysfunction and endometriosis. Congenital structural uterine abnormalities, as seen in this patient, can lead to infertility. A bicornuate uterus is\ncaused by failure of the paramesonephric (m~llerian) ducts to fully fuse, resulting in two completely or partially separate uterine cavities. Because of this, there is a diminished area for egg implantation, as\nwell as placental and fetal development, which predisposes the patient to infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss. A bicornuate uterus also increases the risk for preterm delivery, fetal growth restriction, and\nmalpresentation. Therefore, this patient is al the highest risk for preterm delivery given her anatomic uterine variant.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Ecchymosis after minor bumps or removal of a bandage in an 81-year-old patient can be considered a normal finding due to several factors related to the aging process. As people age, the skin becomes thinner and\nloses elasticity, making it more susceptible to injury. Additionally, the blood vessels become more fragile and are more likely to break and leak blood into the surrounding tissue, leading to the formation of bruises. In\nolder adults, decreased blood flow to the skin and underlying tissue can also contribute to slow wound healing, making it more likely for bruises to persist. These are all normal physiologic changes expected with\naging. It is important to note that certain medical conditions such as clotting disorders and bleeding disorders can increase the risk for bruising in older adults. However, in the absence of any other concerning\nsymptoms or underlying medical conditions, the ecchymosis in this patient can be considered a normal finding related to the aging process. Further evaluation, including a thorough medical history and physical\nexamination, may be necessary to determine if any underlying medical conditions are contributing to the ecchymosis. In this case, without any clear coagulopathy, no implicated medications, and history and\nexamination findings that are age- and situation-appropriate, no further testing is indicated. For this reason, reassurance is the most appropriate next step.",

Forceps-assisted deliveries carry the risk of cephalohematoma, laceration, intracranial hemorrhage, facial nerve injury, skull fracture, and ocular injury.\nThis newborn, whose delivery was assisted with forceps, with a large, contained scalp swelling most likely developed a cephalohematoma secondary to his delivery method.

He has no history of serious illness, has no known allergies, and takes no medications. Four weeks ago, he returned from a deployment to the Caribbean in support\nof humanitarian efforts after a natural disaster.

Which of the following stool studies is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\nA} Glestridium-diffieile-assay\nB} Gulture\nC) Immunochemical test\nBD} Leukeeyte-test\nCorrect Answer: E.\nInfection with Entamoeba histolytica leads to amoebiasis (amoebic dysentery). E. histolytica is an amoebic parasite that forms cysts, which can be transmitted through the fecal-oral route, typically through ingestion of contaminated water.\nAmoebic cysts mature to trophozoites in the large bowel, which may invade the colonic mucosa and interstitium, leading to symptoms of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, or which may enter the bloodstream and cause hepatic amoebic\nabscesses, which present with fever and right upper quadrant pain. The diagnosis can be made with identification of cysts on stool ova and parasite examination, which may show trophozoites with endosomes containing red blood cells, as wel\nas by antigen assay or polymerase chain reaction testing. Colonoscopy shows mucosal ulcers that are often flask-shaped. Treatment of hepatic amoebic abscesses involves combination therapy with metronidazole or tinidazole, as well as an\nanti-luminal agent such as paromomycin or iodoquinol. This patient likely contracted E. histolytica while in the Caribbean when he consumed local food and water.\nIncorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D.\nClostridium difficile assay (Choice A) is used to assess for C. difficile infection. C. difficile typically presents with frequent watery diarrhea, often occurring after treatment with antibiotics. In this case, the patient is experiencing bloody diarrhea in\nthe setting of recent travel to the Caribbean, which makes an amoebic infection more likely.\nCulture (Choice B) of the stool can aid in the diagnosis of bacterial gastroenteritis. Stool culture can help identify infections with organisms such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Shigella. Although Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Shigella\ncan present with bloody diarrhea, this patient was recently traveling in the Caribbean where E. histolytica is endemic, making it the most likely causal organism.\nImmunochemical test (Choice C) helps to identify occult blood in the stool. It is often used to help screen for cases of colon cancer. In this case, the patient is already known to have bloody diarrhea. Because of his recent travel, E. histolytica is\nthe most likely organism implicated, with workup requiring stool ova and parasite examination.\nLeukocyte test (Choice D) can help to identify white blood cells present in the stool. It is not an accurate test for inflammatory diarrhea as it has low- and variable-reported sensitivity and specificity. In cases of E. histolytica, leukocytes are\ntypically not identified on stool studies as the organism destroys the leukocytes. In this case, E. histolytica is the most likely causal organism, requiring stool ova and parasite examination to confirm the diagnosis.\nEducational Objective: Infection with Entamoeba histolytica presents with bloody diarrhea and may lead to invasive amoebiasis including hepatic abscesses. E. histolytica occurs worldwide but occurs much more frequently in resource-limited\nareas such as the Caribbean. Evaluation for E. histolytica includes identification of cysts on stool ova and parasite examination, which may show trophozoites with endosomes containing red blood cells, as well as antigen assay or polymerase\nchain reaction testing.

Puberty typically begins with breast development, followed by pubic hair development and menarche. The development of secondary\nsexual characteristics prior to age 8 in females is referred to as precocious puberty and warrants further evaluation with a thorough history and physical examination, as well as laboratory studies. Normal pubertal development does not require additional\nworkup.\n\nExam Section 1: Item 32 of 50 National Board of Medical Examiners®\nComprehensive Clinical Science Self-Assessment\n.

One week ago, he was treated with amoxicillin for a middle ear infection. He has no history of serious illness and currently takes no medications. He is at the 50th percentile for height and weight.\nVital signs are within normal limits. On examination, the patient holds the right hip flexed and externally rotated. Passive range of motion of the right hip is limited by pain. An x-ray of the right hip shows no.\nabnormalities. His leukocyte count is 10,000/mm5, erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 15 mm/h, and serum C-reactive protein concentration is 1.5 mg/L (N=0.08-3.1). Which of the following is the most\nappropriate treatment for this patient?\nA) Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy\nC) Physical therapy for motion and strength\nE) Surgical debridement of the hip joint\nCorrect Answer: B.\nThe most likely diagnosis in this otherwise healthy patient is transient synovitis of the hip. Transient synovitis is an inflammatory condition involving the synovial lining of weight-bearing joints, with the hip being\ncommonly affected. It classically presents in children recovering from a viral infection. Symptoms include pain when bearing weight, antalgic gait, refusal to ambulate, tenderness over the affected joint, and pain\nelicited with range of motion. Vital signs are generally within normal limits, as are laboratory studies apart from increased markers of inflammation, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Antecedent viral infection\nhas been reported in up to 30% of cases of transient synovitis. Diagnosis involves the exclusion of emergent or urgent conditions, such as cellulitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and fracture. In this case, the patient\ndoes not exhibit symptoms of infection, and laboratory studies show a leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein within normal limits. Treatment is supportive and involves rest and\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If there is diagnostic uncertainty, arthrocentesis should be performed to exclude septic arthritis, along with imaging studies to assess for osteomyelitis or fracture.\nIncorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E.\nIntravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (Choice A) would be indicated in cases of septic arthritis or osteomyelitis. In this case, the patient most likely has transient synovitis of the hip as vital signs and results\nof laboratory studies are within normal limits. Initial broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy in cases of septic arthritis or osteomyelitis should include vancomycin because of its effectiveness against Staphylococcus\naureus.\nPhysical therapy for motion and strength (Choice C) is a conservative treatment option for hip pain. This patient likely has transient synovitis which often resolves in an acute to subacute time frame. Nonsteroidal\nanti-inflammatory drug therapy is the most appropriate treatment option for this patient due to the self-limiting nature of transient synovitis and prompt pain relief.\nSerial hip joint aspirations (Choice D) is a treatment option for septic arthritis. After joint aspiration is performed, Gram stain and culture can be performed on the synovial fluid to evaluate for septic arthritis and to\ndetermine antibiotic sensitivities if the joint is found to be infected.\nSurgical debridement of the hip joint (Choice E) is also a treatment option for septic arthritis. It can be performed either initially or after joint aspiration if rapid improvement is not achieved. This patient's laboratory\nstudies and vital signs are within normal limits making transient synovitis the most likely diagnosis.\nEducational Objective: Transient synovitis is an inflammatory condition involving the synovial lining of weight-bearing joints, with the hip being frequently affected. Symptoms are transient and the most appropriate\ntreatment is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy. It is important to rule out emergent or urgent conditions, such as cellulitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and fracture.\na Cc @ € © e",

Specificity is the proportion of people who do\nnot have the disease who test negative. High specificity is useful in ruling in a disease.

Some\nstatistical measures, including positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), are impacted by disease prevalence. In this example, the screening test for alcohol use shows a high degree of\nsensitivity and specificity, which suggests that its proportion of TP and TN results is high in comparison to its proportion of FP and FN results.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Renal artery stenosis causes secondary hypertension related to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Low afferent blood flow to the affected kidney leads to abnormal stimulation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus and excessive production of renin. Renin converts\nangiotensinogen to angiotensin |, which is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the pulmonary vasculature. Angiotensin Il is a potent vasoconstrictor that directly mediates systemic hypertension via increased sodium reabsorption in the renal tubules,\naldosterone and vasopressin release, increased adrenergic tone, and stimulation of hypothalamic thirst centers. In younger patients, fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis, while in older patients it is typically caused by atherosclerosis. This patient likely has\nbilateral renal artery stenosis due to atherosclerosis, as evidenced by his history of carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass grafting. An abdominal bruit may be appreciated in the region of the stenosis. Diagnosis is established with renal artery Doppler ultrasonography or MRI, which\ncan quantify the degree of renal artery stenosis and associated kidney atrophy. Treatment involves angioplasty or stenting of the stenosed renal artery to improve flow. ACE inhibitors can be considered for unilateral stenosis. In the setting of bilateral renal artery stenosis, however, use of ACE\ninhibitors will decrease systemic hypertension but will lead to acute kidney failure, as evidenced by the acutely increased serum urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations in this patient following initiation of lisinopril.",

She has the sensation of incomplete emptying of the bladder unless\nshe pushes the mass back into her vagina. During the past 5 years, she has had increased pelvic pressure with prolonged standing or lifting. She does not have urine loss when coughing or laughing. She has no history of serious.\nillness and takes no medications. All her pregnancies ended in uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. The patient is 160 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 50 kg (110 Ib); BMI is 20 kg/m2 Vital signs are within normal limits. A photograph of the\nmass is shown. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Bartholin gland cyst\n\nC) Leiomyoma uteri\n\nD) Urethral diverticulum\n\nE) Uterine sarcoma\nCorrect Answer: B.\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) occurs secondary to pelvic floor dysfunction and weakness, resulting in herniation of abdominopelvic organs which causes mass effect and protrusion along the vaginal wall. The herniation of these pelvic organs\ncan lead to pelvic pressure, as well as urinary, defecatory, and sexual dysfunction. POP is a spectrum of diseases, with complete procidentia being a severe form that includes herniation of the entire anterior, posterior, and apical vaginal\n‘compartments through the introitus. The patient will have a degree of cystocele (ie, bladder prolapse), rectocele (ie, rectal prolapse), and enterocele (ie, intestinal prolapse), respectively, as a result of the descent of the pelvic organs. In these\nextreme cases, the cervix and uterus may be entirely or partially visible at the introitus. However, patients can have less severe forms with isolated prolapse, such as the cystocele seen in this patient. Cystocele is common in multiparous\npatients and is associated with stress or overflow urinary incontinence and the inability to fully empty the bladder. In severe cystoceles, the anterior vaginal wall may hemniate through the introitus, leading to a palpable or visible mass at the\nintroitus that may enlarge as intra-abdominal pressure increases. Other risk factors for POP include advancing age and obesity. Diagnosis of POP is made through a complete physical examination, and treatment includes pelvic floor\nexercises, vaginal pessaries, and surgical repair.\nIncorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E.\nBartholin gland cyst (Choice A) is caused by an obstruction of a Bartholin gland, one of which is located on each side of the introitus and provides secretions that lubricate the vagina. It presents with a small area of painful, fluctuant swelling\n‘over the posterior aspect of the labium majus. With ongoing obstruction and inflammation, infection and Bartholin gland abscess can develop. It would not be expected to cause a mass that protrudes from the introitus with increased intra-\nabdominal pressure, nor would it be expected to cause an inability to empty the bladder.\nLeiomyoma uteri (Choice C) are common benign tumors of the uterine smooth muscle. When symptomatic, they can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain, or reproductive dysfunction. Physical examination shows an enlarged,\nirregularly shaped uterus. They are estrogen-responsive and thus typically decrease in size with menopause. As they are formed from the uterine myometrium, it would be unlikely that they would be visible at the introitus, especially in this\nPatient who is postmenopausal.\nUrethral diverticulum (Choice D) is a small outpouching of the urethra that presents with recurrent urinary tract infections, urethritis, urinary incontinence, and incomplete bladder emptying. It would not cause the large external pelvic mass\n‘seen on this patient.\nUterine sarcoma (Choice E) is a rare uterine cancer that typically develops from the myometrium or connective tissue of the uterus. Symptoms include abnormal uterine bleeding, abdominopelvic pain, pelvic pressure, and abdominal\ndistension. This patient has no uterine bleeding or abdominopelvic pain. Additionally, as the sarcoma is formed from the uterine tissues, it would be unlikely to be visibly extruding from the vaginal introitus.\nEducational Objective: Pelvic organ prolapse occurs secondary to pelvic floor dysfunction weakness, which results in the herniation of abdominopelvic organs through the vaginal wall. Complete procidentia is a severe form of pelvic organ\nprolapse that includes herniation of the entire anterior, posterior, and apical vaginal compartments through the introitus, although less severe forms with isolated prolapse of individual organs can occur. One example is a cystocele, which is\ncaused by herniation of the bladder through the anterior vaginal wall, most commonly in multiparous patients. It is associated with stress or overflow incontinence, pelvic pressure, and the inability to fully empty the bladder. In severe cases, it\n‘can cause herniation of the anterior vaginal wall through the introitus.\n\n0 C ¢ @ 6 © ©",

The breakdown of skeletal muscle myocytes results in the release of myoglobin and creatine kinase into systemic circulation. Increased creatine kinase activity can be used as a marker to evaluate for the presence and progression\nof rhabdomyolysis. The abnormal release of myoglobin can cause nephrotoxicity, leading to an acute kidney injury from acute tubular necrosis. This patient has electrolyte derangements including hyperkalemia, also common in rhabdomyolysis, as intracellular\nions are released to the interstitial space and ultimately returned to circulation. Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, and hypocalcemia are common disturbances in rhabdomyolysis. Treatment of rhabdomyolysis requires supportive care and\nintravenous fluid hydration, making the administration of intravenous 0.9% saline the most appropriate next step for this patient. This intervention will assist in the clearance of myoglobin from the kidneys plus restoration of normal electrolyte balance, limiting\nnephrotoxicity.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Given that this patient arrives to the emergency department (ED) with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and is unarousable, the most appropriate next step in management is intravenous administration of 3% saline. The goal of this administration is to restore\neunatremia as acute hyponatremia is the likely precipitant of the seizure. Caution must be taken when considering the rate at which to administer hypertonic saline. A rapid increase in serum sodium concentration in a patient with chronic hyponatremia can\ncause osmotic demyelination syndrome (QDS), also known as central pontine myelinolysis. For patients with acute hyponatremia, this is less of a concern of ODS, though it must be taken into consideration. According to the American Society of Nephrology, the\nsafe rate of correction for chronic hyponatremia is generally considered to be less than 12 mEq/L in 24 hours or less than 18 mEq/L in 48 hours. However, when the serum sodium concentration is less than 120 mEq/L, the correction should not exceed 8 mEq/L\nin 24 hours to avoid ODS. When acute neurologic symptoms are present, initial correction should only be to the point where neurologic symptoms resolve, followed by slow gradual correction to reach eunatremia thereafter. In general, a bolus of hypertonic\nsaline sufficient to raise the serum sodium by 4-6 mEq/L is enough to prevent further neurologic symptoms, such as seizures, though this number is clinically variable. Treatment should be targeted to the patient's specific signs and symptoms. Paraneoplastic\nsyndromes, such as inappropriate ADH (vasopressin) secretion, should be a suspected diagnosis given this patient’s ED presentation, history of small cell carcinoma of the lung, and hyponatremia on initial laboratory studies.",

In patients presenting with severe hyponatremia, such as those with confusion, stroke-like symptoms,\nor seizures, as seen in this patient, prompt correction of hyponatremia is paramount and should be accomplished with intravenous hypertonic saline. To minimize the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome, the serum sodium should only be corrected to the\npoint of resolution of acute neurologic symptoms, with slow gradual correction to reach eunatremia in the coming days to weeks. Intravenous administration of 3% saline is the most appropriate",

Regression refers to returning to a less psychologically developed state. Regression can manifest as tantrums, excessive dependency, excessive demands, loss of\ncontinence, and rarely, mutism (as seen in this patient). Risk factors for regression include underdeveloped coping skills, difficulty with emotion regulation, and stressful or traumatic events. Both adults\nand children are vulnerable to regression. Medical hospitalization is a stressor that commonly leads to regression, even in patients without personality disorders. Physical or sexual violence is a major\nstressor that can induce regression.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease characterized by decreased lung function from a combination of chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema,\nresulting in airflow obstruction on expiration. Breath sounds are decreased because of reduced airflow and a prolonged expiratory phase as the pathologically\nnarrowed airways are further compressed by positive intrathoracic pressure during expiration. Heart sounds may be distant secondary to emphysematous lung\nchanges (eg, sound is transmitted poorly through air relative to normal lung tissue). Pulmonary abnormalities can be evaluated by pulmonary function testing, which\nincludes spirometry, full-body plethysmography, single-breath diffusing capacity, arterial blood gas analysis, and pulse oximetry. Spirometry is the most useful in\ndiagnosing obstructive lung disease, which is defined by a decrease in the ratio of the volume of air forcefully expelled in the first second of expiration to the total\nvolume of air expelled during the expiratory phase (FEV,/FVC). The severity of obstruction is graded by the amount of FEV, reduction compared to predicted values.\nTreatment is focused on smoking cessation and supplemental oxygen to decrease mortality. Symptoms are managed with inhaled short-acting B-adrenergic agonists,\nlong-acting B-adrenergic agonists, muscarinic antagonists (eg, ipratropium), and glucocorticoids. This patient's continued worsening dyspnea on exertion despite\nappropriate medical therapies is the most important factor for determining his prognosis. Prognosis in COPD depends on the functional ability of the lung to serve its\npurpose as an organ (ie, gas exchange) in times of rest or activity. In this case, the patient's symptomatic shortness of breath on exertion is an indicator of\nprogressive organ failure and failure of the organ to respond to an appropriate physiologic demand.",

Peripheral blood smear will show a diverse array of immature and partially mature cells of the granulocytic\nlineage with basophilia. Leukostasis, a condition in which hyperleukocytosis leads to end-organ damage from occlusion of capillaries by malignant, non-distensible cells, is uncommon in CML because malignant\ncells are well-differentiated and pliable. This contrasts with conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia, in which circulating blasts, which are large and not particularly pliable,\neasily lodge in capillaries to cause pulmonary and neurologic complications.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "While randomized controlled trials form the gold standard of medical research and generate more powerful evidence than other forms of observational or descriptive studies, they remain susceptible to error. A common form of error\nresults from limitations in the number of study participants, which in turn limits statistical power, the ability of the study to detect a difference between groups if one exists. When the power of a study is increased, the incidence of a\ntype Il error decreases. A type Il error occurs when a study shows no difference between the null and alternative hypotheses, when in fact, a difference exists. The type Il error rate is calculated by subtracting the power from 100%. A\nmeta-analysis is a form of study in which statistical analysis is performed to combine the results of multiple studies addressing the same question. Meta-analysis is useful for overcoming limitations of the constituent studies within the\nmeta-analysis. By pooling the results of multiple studies, meta-analyses reduce the risk for type II error due to the smaller sample sizes within each constituent randomized controlled trial. However, meta-analyses are susceptible to\ntheir own errors, primarily related to inclusion criteria, statistical methods, and the errors of constituent studies. The meta-analysis in this example provides a forest plot, which is a commonly used method of summarizing the results\nof multiple studies in a single graphical representation. The diamond shapes in the diagram represent measures of the effect observed in each individual study, bounded by confidence intervals represented as horizontal lines. The\nvertical line in the center of the plot represents the line of null effect. When the confidence interval crosses or includes the line of null effect, it implies that the observed result was not statistically significant and may include the null\nvalue. In this example, the meta-analysis observed results that trended toward a reduced risk for postprocedural infection; however, this result was not statistically significant and therefore may have occurred due to random chance.",

He feels well. He has no known allergies or history of serious illness. He\ntakes no medications. He has smoked one and one-half packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years and drinks six beers weekly. He has a sedentary lifestyle. He is\n178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 82 kg (180 Ib); BMI is 26 kg/m2. His pulse is 68/min and regular, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to\nauscultation; there is a prolonged expiratory phase. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. During the examination, the patient asks what he can expect if he\nquits smoking now. Which of the following is the most appropriate physician response?\nB) \"In 5 years, your risk for lung cancer will decrease to that of a nonsmoker.\"\nC) \"Your pulmonary function will not decrease further in the future.\"\n5) “Yourriskfortung-eance wl be the same-asitis now!\nE) \"Your risk for myocardial infarction will be higher than that of a nonsmoker for the rest of your life, but your risk for cerebral infarction will decrease.\"\nCorrect Answer: A.\nHealthy patients who do not smoke experience age-related decline in pulmonary function starting at around age 25 years. For example, the lung parenchyma typically loses\nits scaffolding, leading to dilation of air spaces, known as senile emphysema. Alveolar dead space also increases. Smoking increases the rate of age-related decline.\nSmoking cessation is the most likely intervention to prevent worsening of this patient's obstructive lung disease. Long-term smokers are at risk of numerous diseases of the\nlung including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is diagnosed by spirometry. This patient, with a prolonged expiratory phase, may have smoking- and age-\nrelated lung decline or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Further diagnostic testing is needed to determine the diagnosis. Other common symptoms include dyspnea\non exertion and productive cough. Treatment focuses on preventing further decline in respiratory function through smoking cessation in addition to the use of medications,\nsuch as inhaled antimuscarinics, short and long-acting B-adrenergic agonists, and corticosteroids. Patients with resting or ambulatory saturation less than 88% are also\ncandidates for oxygen therapy.\nIncorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E.\n\"In 5 years, your risk for lung cancer will decrease to that of a nonsmoker\" (Choice B) and \"Your risk for lung cancer will be the same as it is now\" (Choice D) are inaccurate.\nThe patient's lung cancer risk will remain increased compared to the general population because of his smoking history. However, his future risk will decrease if he quits\nsmoking compared to if he continues smoking.\n“Your pulmonary function will not decrease further in the future\" (Choice C) is inaccurate. Age-related pulmonary function decline typically begins around age 25 years.\nDilation of air spaces and increased alveolar space commonly occur with age.\n“Your risk for myocardial infarction will be higher than that of a nonsmoker for the rest of your life, but your risk for cerebral infarction will decrease\" (Choice E) accurately\ndescribes the patient's myocardial infarction risk but not his cerebral infarction risk. Smoking history increases cerebral infarction risk. Smoking increases risk of\natherosclerotic buildup in both the coronary and intracranial arteries.\nEducational Objective: In normal aging, air spaces dilate and alveolar dead space increases. Smokers should be encouraged to stop smoking as this intervention is the\nmost likely to prevent an increased rate of age-related pulmonary decline.\na C @ @ € © m",

Definitive diagnosis requires core needle or excisional lymph\nnode biopsy showing Reed-Sternberg cells, as in this patient.

Because maternal antibodies can cross the placenta, it is important to determine\nwhether this patient's fetus has Kell-positive or Kell-negative RBCs. If her fetus had Kell-positive RBCs, the antibodies created by her immune system would cause hemolysis of the fetal erythrocytes,\nleading to severe fetal hemolytic anemia (eg, erythroblastosis fetalis) and likely fetal demise. As the mother has no signs of hemolysis in the presence of anti-Kell antibodies, her RBCs do not have\nKell antigens, and she would not have contributed a Kell antigen to her fetus. The easiest way to determine the antigen status of the fetus is to determine the antigen status of the father. If he is Kell\nnegative as well, then the fetus will be Kell negative, and there is no risk of erythroblastosis fetalis. However, if he is positive, there is a possibility that the fetus will be Kell-antigen positive and suffer\nfrom erythroblastosis fetalis.",

The three main components of\nthe intervertebral disc are the cartilaginous endplates, annulus fibrosis, and the nucleus pulposus. In degenerative disc disease, the nutrient gradient from the cartilaginous endplates.\ndecreases with aging along with a declining water content of the nucleus pulposus, resulting in loss of disc height. This combined with repetitive axial forces can result in tears of the annulus\nfibrosus. The periphery of the annulus fibrosus has sensory innervation from the sinuvertebral nerve. Presentation of degenerative disc disease commonly includes pain that worsens with\nflexion and on Valsalva maneuver, coughing, or sneezing. It is important to evaluate for signs of radiculopathy including sensory deficits, deep tendon reflex changes, or muscle weakness.\nPhysical examination tests to evaluate for radiculopathy include the straight-leg raise with a positive result being reproduction of pain into the leg. Red flag symptoms in low back pain that\ncould indicate cauda equina or conus medullaris syndrome include saddle anesthesia, bowel or bladder incontinence, and lower extremity weakness which warrants emergent surgical\nevaluation. This patient has a neurologic examination with no focal findings as well as chronic pain with no reported trauma. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is an x-ray series of\nthe lumbar spine to evaluate for degenerative changes.

Due\nto damage to the glomerular filtration barrier, large proteins such as albumin are filtered into the urine causing hypoalbuminemia. To counteract the low serum oncotic pressure caused by\nurinary protein losses, the liver produces lipoproteins leading to hyperlipidemia. A biopsy of membranous nephropathy usually shows diffuse thickening of the glomerular capillary wall, and\non immunofluorescence, IgG deposition along the glomerular basement membrane. Electron microscopy also shows subepithelial deposits. Membranous nephropathy is the most common\nnephrotic syndrome in White adults and can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune disease against phospholipase A2\nreceptors, chronic hepatitis infection (especially hepatitis B or C virus), or pharmaceuticals such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or penicillamine. Untreated, it may progress to\nchronic kidney failure. The addition of an ACE inhibitor such as lisinopril to the patient's regimen results in decreased angiotensin || production, which causes relative efferent arteriole\ndilatation. This decreases constriction of the efferent arteriole, decreasing glomerular filtration pressure and reducing hyperfiltration injury of the glomerulus, resulting in delayed progression\nof the patient's nephropathy.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Anaphylaxis, a severe type | hypersensitivity reaction, presents following exposure to an allergen, most commonly medications, foods, or insect stings. It is mediated by activation of IgE, which leads to the release of histamine and other cytokines from\nmast cells and basophils. This subsequently leads to acute inflammation and profound vasodilation in multiple organ systems, generally the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and integumentary systems. Symptoms include the rapid onset of\nbronchospasm with dyspnea or wheezing, urticaria, flushing, nausea and emesis, edematous lips and tongue, and hypotension with tachycardia. When severe and untreated, it can progress to circulatory collapse with cardiovascular arrest or death\ndue to asphyxiation and airway obstruction. Stridor, present in this case, suggests the presence of glottic or subglottic angioedema and is a warning sign of impending loss of the airway. Treatment begins with urgent administration of epinephrine,\nfollowed by antihistamines, bronchodilators, glucocorticoids, and intravenous fluids. Severe cases may require endotracheal intubation and the administration of vasopressors. This patient consumed a granola bar that likely contained traces of an\nallergen, leading to an anaphylactic reaction with her symptoms of dyspnea, urticaria, and stridor. Epinephrine, a potent vasoconstrictor, should be administered first as it decreases airway edema and hypotension. In this case, emergent attention\nshould be paid to the airway, and if after appropriate administration of epinephrine there is no improvement in stridor, or there is worsening stridor, the patient should be emergently intubated.",

Bulimia nervosa is characterized by cycles of uncontrollable eating and compensatory purging behaviors,\nsuch as vomiting, and overuse of laxatives, or diuretics that occur at least once a week for 3 months or more. Unlike patients with anorexia nervosa, patients with bulimia nervosa typically have a BMI in the healthy weight range and do not\nexperience amenorrhea. Physical examination of patients with a binge eating/purging type of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa can show dental caries from gastric hydrochloric acid erosion of enamel, parotid gland swelling from salivary gland\noverstimulation, and scars on the knuckles secondary to abrasions from the incisors when inducing vomiting. The loss of gastric hydrochloric acid through vomiting can lead to hypochloremia and metabolic alkalosis. Alternatively, when laxatives\nare overused, either metabolic alkalosis or non—anion gap metabolic acidosis can occur. Metabolic acidosis occurs commonly secondary to the loss of bicarbonate in the stool. Hypokalemia is common secondary to potassium wasting in the stool.\nIn severe cases of bulimia nervosa, signs of hypovolemia, such as tachycardia and hypotension (eg, this patient's orthostatic hypotension), may be present. Hypovolemia leads to increased aldosterone concentrations, resulting in further potassium\nsecretion. As potassium is involved in the membrane potential of muscle cells (including skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscles), hypokalemia typically leads to general weakness, muscle cramps, fatigue, palpitations, and/or decreased\ngastrointestinal motility. Treatment of bulimia nervosa is through a combined medical and psychiatric approach and involves correcting fluid and electrolyte imbalances alongside behavioral and pharmacologic therapy.",

Many medical organizations, such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force, make recommendations on appropriate screening recommendations for patients based on\ntheir age, sex, and risk factors. While screening examinations and tests can lead to the prevention of or early diagnosis of disease, they can also lead to additional, unnecessary testing and invasive procedures, so the benefits must outweigh the\nharms when applying each screening test to an individual patient. While other categories exist, most screening recommendations can be grouped into two: cardiovascular risk assessment and cancer screening. For example, most adult patients are\nscreened for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and undergo colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening. Female patients are screened for cervical cancer starting at age 21 years and breast cancer starting at age 40 to 50 years. Alll patients with\nspecific risk factors (eg, tobacco use, environmental exposures) are routinely screened for the development of lung cancer. For this specific patient, the most appropriate screening test is a measurement of fasting serum glucose concentration to rule\nout type 2 diabetes mellitus. Testing with a fasting serum glucose concentration or hemoglobin A, is recommended in patients aged 35 to 70 years who are overweight or obese, as well as in those who have concurrent hypertension or\nhyperlipidemia.

The early stages of Lyme disease can be treated with doxycycline, which acts by preventing the attachment of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes. Adverse effects of\ntetracycline antibiotics include gastrointestinal distress, photosensitivity, and, in children, discoloration of teeth and inhibition of bone growth, which contraindicates the use of doxycycline for pregnant patients. Later stages of Lyme disease are\ncharacterized by carditis, atrioventricular heart block, facial nerve palsy (which is often bilateral), and migratory arthralgias.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient presents with failure to thrive. Failure to thrive is commonly defined as a persistent weight at or below the 5th percentile for age and sex, although a variety of other definitions are employed. Failure to thrive in an infant should prompt\nevaluation for the underlying cause. Common causes include inadequate nutritional intake (due to insufficient breastfeeding, inappropriate diet, poverty, neglect), malabsorption (due to cystic fibrosis, pancreatic insufficiency, cow milk allergy, or\ngastrointestinal malformations), or increased metabolic demand (due to congenital cardiac, pulmonary, or kidney malformations, hyperthyroidism, or malignancy). In this patient, paucity of subcutaneous fat and thin hair, along with light-colored stools,\nraises suspicion for cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the CFTR gene, leading to a deficiency in a chloride channel that secretes chloride in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract and reabsorbs\nchloride in sweat glands. This abnormal chloride transport causes decreased chloride and water secretion and increased water reabsorption, leading to abnormally viscous mucus. The thick mucus in the gastrointestinal tract contributes to pancreatic\ninsufficiency, steatorrhea, and malabsorption, leading to a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. In the lungs, the disease manifests as recurrent pneumonia, especially with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nObstruction and destruction of the airways leads to hypoxemia, air trapping, and bronchiectasis. The absence of the digestive enzymes made by the pancreas leads to malnutrition (eg, cachexia, muscle wasting), weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and\nfrequent, loose, foul-smelling, sometimes oily stools (steatorrhea). Cystic fibrosis may also present with meconium ileus, another cause of failure to pass stool after birth. The diagnosis is established with sweat chloride testing or confirmatory genetic\ntesting.",

However, thorough evaluation is necessary for any patient that presents with a breast mass as this can be the first presenting sign of breast cancer, the most common\nnondermatologic cancer in women. The evaluation should include a thorough history including family history and physical examination. Physical examination typically shows a smooth, rubbery, freely mobile mass without\ncoexisting skin changes, lymphadenopathy, or nipple discharge in benign lesions. In contrast, malignant lesions often present with irregular, firm, adherent masses and one or more of these concurrent signs. Further\nevaluation includes diagnostic imaging with either ultrasonography (if under age 35 years) or mammography (if over age 35 years). If ultrasonography in this patient shows a cystic lesion, fine-needle aspiration should be\ncompleted to see if the mass resolves and to treat the patient's associated symptoms. If the cyst disappears, no further treatment is warranted. If it does not, core needle biopsy should be performed to rule out malignancy.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Inadequate free water intake leads to dehydration and a variety of electrolyte disturbances including hypernatremia, which is defined as a serum sodium concentration greater than 145 mEq/L. Under normal conditions, increases in serum osmolarity are detected by\nthe hypothalamus, resulting in increased secretion of vasopressin and in increased thirst, resulting in the retention of free water in the kidneys and in increased water intake, respectively. Hypernatremia occurs most often in elderly patients, typically during an acute\nillness where mobility and access to water may be impaired, or where altered mental status or impaired thirst response may limit water intake. Hypernatremia may also occur in the setting of a variety of conditions that cause loss of both free water and electrolytes and\nresulting in hypotonic fluid loss, such as in the setting of diuretic use, severe diarrhea, or nasogastric suctioning or gastrointestinal fluid drains. Patients typically present with altered mental status and clinical evidence of volume depletion (eg, tachycardia, hypotension,\northostasis, poor skin turgor, dry mucous membranes). The diagnosis is established with serum chemistry, which can also identify other electrolyte abnormalities. Evaluation for underlying infections that may have precipitated the episode (such as with chest x-ray and\nurinalysis) is important. Given this patient's negative infectious workup, itis likely that her symptoms were caused by physical debilitation, limiting her access to water, exacerbated by the use of furosemide. Results of laboratory studies show hypernatremia,\nhyperkalemia, hyperchloremia, alkalosis, and increased serum urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations, consistent with volume contraction and prerenal azotemia. Treatment is with correction of volume depletion. Isotonic crystalloid infusion with 0.9% saline (which\ncontains 154 mEq/L of sodium) is preferable, as this will correct volume depletion while causing minimal risk for overly rapid correction of hypernatremia. The rate of correction is dependent on the suspected duration of hypernatremia. Acute hypernatremia of less than\n24 hours duration can be corrected rapidly, while more chronic hypernatremia should be corrected slowly at a maximum rate of approximately 10 mEq/day to avoid cerebral edema.",

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Primary dysmenorrhea, or painful menstruation, is defined as pain that accompanies each menstrual cycle but is not associated with any underlying pathology. It is a common cause of cyclic pelvic pain in healthy patients\nassigned female at birth. Patients describe cramping lower abdominal or pelvic pain that begins several days prior to the onset of menses, which persists for several days, along with fatigue, nausea, vomiting, presyncope,\nand/or headache. Symptoms often begin during adolescence and commonly interfere with quality of life and essential activities, such as school or work. To diagnose primary dysmenorrhea, the causes of secondary\ndysmenorrhea must be ruled out. These may include endometriosis, leiomyomata uteri, adhesions, pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical stenosis, or adenomyosis. Many of these can be reasonably assessed on pelvic\nexamination or pelvic ultrasonography, which in this case did not show any characteristic abnormalities. Primary dysmenorrhea is attributed to painful uterine contractions and uterine vasoconstriction in response to\nincreased prostaglandin production by the sloughing endometrium. Thus, treatment targets this pathway with medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and topical heat therapy. Oral contraceptive therapy\nor a progestin IUD may also be used to regulate the symptoms if persistent. Thus, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient with primary dysmenorrhea is the initiation of oral contraceptive therapy.",

Temporal arteritis is an autoimmune inflammatory vasculitis of medium\nand large vessels. Once temporal arteritis is suspected, treatment with a high-dose corticosteroid such as prednisone should occur immediately to preserve vision. Classic symptoms include fever, chills, weight loss,\nheadache, history of preceding transient vision loss (amaurosis fugax), jaw claudication, tenderness of the scalp, and pale optic disc edema. Temporal arteritis most commonly affects the vessels of the head and neck,\nparticularly the ophthalmic artery, inflammatory occlusion of which can result in sudden, ischemic damage to the retina. Once vision loss occurs, it is irreversible and commonly followed by vision loss in the contralateral eye\nwithin days or weeks. Notably, ophthalmic examination may detect no abnormalities before irreversible arterial occlusion has occurred. New onset of headaches in an elderly patient should raise suspicion for temporal\narteritis. Temporal arteritis frequently occurs in association with polymyalgia rheumatica, which is characterized by stiffness of proximal muscles, as in this case. Laboratory studies show thrombocytosis and increased\ninflammatory markers, including ESR and C-reactive protein. Duplex ultrasonography may show reduced flow within inflamed vessels.

During a drowning event, aspirated fluid causes local inflammation in the lungs along with the dilution of surfactant, leading to impaired compliance and airspace infiltration. This can result in persistent\nand severe hypoxia despite management with positive end-expiratory pressure and increased fraction of inspired oxygen. Prolonged hypoxia leads to end organ dysfunction, including acidosis, hypoxic brain injury, and cardiac arrhythmias. Damage to\nthe alveoli with resulting inflammation can lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which appears on chest x-ray as noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. This patient is at increased risk for developing ARDS in the 48\nhours following the drowning event. Intubation and management of hypoxia is appropriate for patients with severe respiratory distress, hypoxic and/or hypercarbic respiratory failure unresponsive to noninvasive measures, neurologic deterioration, or\ncardiac arrest. Adequate management of hypoxia decreases the risk for further complications of hypoxic brain injury.",
