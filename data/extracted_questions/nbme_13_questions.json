Diabetic\nketoacidosis is caused by the accumulation of serum ketones such as B-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid, and acetone in the setting of deficient insulin signaling. Absent insulin signaling leads to dysregulated fatty acid degradation and ketone synthesis\nbecause of a relative state of starvation. It is common for young patients with undiagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus to present with ketoacidosis, as in this case. Patients present with reports of fatigue, altered mental status or obtundation, polyuria, shortness of\nbreath, and diffuse abdominal discomfort. Vital signs may show tachycardia and tachypnea. Kussmaul respirations (rapid and deep) are a classic physical examination finding due to respiratory compensation for the underlying metabolic acidosis. Laboratory\nstudies typically show increased glucose, ketones, and a high anion gap due to the accumulation of unmeasured anions in serum. Anion gap is calculated as the difference between sodium and the sum of bicarbonate and chloride anions. Treatment is through\nreplacement of insulin, volume repletion, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of any precipitating conditions. While analyzing the biochemical results of arterial blood gas analysis, in cases of a high anion gap acidosis, Winters formula should\nbe used to determine if respiratory compensation for the acidosis is present, or if a second deficit is also present. Winters formula states that the partial pressure of carbon dioxide should equal 1.5 x [bicarbonate] + 8 +/—",

As people age, the skin becomes thinner and\nloses elasticity, making it more susceptible to injury. Additionally, the blood vessels become more fragile and are more likely to break and leak blood into the surrounding tissue, leading to the formation of bruises. In\nolder adults, decreased blood flow to the skin and underlying tissue can also contribute to slow wound healing, making it more likely for bruises to persist. These are all normal physiologic changes expected with\naging. It is important to note that certain medical conditions such as clotting disorders and bleeding disorders can increase the risk for bruising in older adults. However, in the absence of any other concerning\nsymptoms or underlying medical conditions, the ecchymosis in this patient can be considered a normal finding related to the aging process. Further evaluation, including a thorough medical history and physical\nexamination, may be necessary to determine if any underlying medical conditions are contributing to the ecchymosis. In this case, without any clear coagulopathy, no implicated medications, and history and\nexamination findings that are age- and situation-appropriate, no further testing is indicated.

Forceps-assisted deliveries carry the risk of cephalohematoma, laceration, intracranial hemorrhage, facial nerve injury, skull fracture, and ocular injury.\nThis newborn, whose delivery was assisted with forceps, with a large, contained scalp swelling most likely developed a cephalohematoma secondary to his delivery method.

During this time, he has had a 3-kg (7-Ib) weight loss\nbecause of decreased appetite. He has not had nausea or vomiting. He has no history of serious illness, has no known allergies, and takes no medications. Four weeks ago, he returned from a deployment to the Caribbean in support\nof humanitarian efforts after a natural disaster. During the deployment, he frequently ate food and drank water sold by local street vendors. He appears uncomfortable but is not in acute distress. Temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse\nis 88/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 128/72 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows softness with mild right lower quadrant tendemess. There is no hepatosplenomegaly and no rebound or guarding. The remainder\nof the examination shows no abnormalities.

Which of the following stool studies is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\nA} Glestridium-diffieile-assay\nB} Gulture\nC) Immunochemical test\nBD} Leukeeyte-test\nCorrect Answer: E.\nInfection with Entamoeba histolytica leads to amoebiasis (amoebic dysentery). E. histolytica is an amoebic parasite that forms cysts, which can be transmitted through the fecal-oral route, typically through ingestion of contaminated water.\nAmoebic cysts mature to trophozoites in the large bowel, which may invade the colonic mucosa and interstitium, leading to symptoms of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, or which may enter the bloodstream and cause hepatic amoebic\nabscesses, which present with fever and right upper quadrant pain. The diagnosis can be made with identification of cysts on stool ova and parasite examination, which may show trophozoites with endosomes containing red blood cells, as wel\nas by antigen assay or polymerase chain reaction testing. Colonoscopy shows mucosal ulcers that are often flask-shaped. Treatment of hepatic amoebic abscesses involves combination therapy with metronidazole or tinidazole, as well as an\nanti-luminal agent such as paromomycin or iodoquinol. This patient likely contracted E. histolytica while in the Caribbean when he consumed local food and water.\nIncorrect Answers: A, B, C, and D.\nClostridium difficile assay (Choice A) is used to assess for C. difficile infection. C. difficile typically presents with frequent watery diarrhea, often occurring after treatment with antibiotics. In this case, the patient is experiencing bloody diarrhea in\nthe setting of recent travel to the Caribbean, which makes an amoebic infection more likely.\nCulture (Choice B) of the stool can aid in the diagnosis of bacterial gastroenteritis. Stool culture can help identify infections with organisms such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Shigella. Although Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Shigella\ncan present with bloody diarrhea, this patient was recently traveling in the Caribbean where E. histolytica is endemic, making it the most likely causal organism.\nImmunochemical test (Choice C) helps to identify occult blood in the stool. It is often used to help screen for cases of colon cancer. In this case, the patient is already known to have bloody diarrhea. Because of his recent travel, E. histolytica is\nthe most likely organism implicated, with workup requiring stool ova and parasite examination.\nLeukocyte test (Choice D) can help to identify white blood cells present in the stool. It is not an accurate test for inflammatory diarrhea as it has low- and variable-reported sensitivity and specificity. In cases of E. histolytica, leukocytes are\ntypically not identified on stool studies as the organism destroys the leukocytes. In this case, E. histolytica is the most likely causal organism, requiring stool ova and parasite examination to confirm the diagnosis.\nEducational Objective: Infection with Entamoeba histolytica presents with bloody diarrhea and may lead to invasive amoebiasis including hepatic abscesses. E. histolytica occurs worldwide but occurs much more frequently in resource-limited\nareas such as the Caribbean. Evaluation for E. histolytica includes identification of cysts on stool ova and parasite examination, which may show trophozoites with endosomes containing red blood cells, as well as antigen assay or polymerase\nchain reaction testing.

The typical clinical presentation of Wernicke encephalopathy is.\na triad of acute altered mental status (eg, disorientation), ophthalmoplegia/nystagmus, and ataxia. The symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy are reversible but increase the risk for developing Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (also known as\nKorsakoff psychosis) in patients with chronic alcohol use disorders if not immediately treated with high-dose intravenous thiamine therapy. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is an irreversible condition that features anterograde and retrograde\namnesia along with the consequent tendency to confabulate or verbalize false stories or memories in order to compensate for the inability to remember.

He is at the 50th percentile for height and weight.\nVital signs are within normal limits. On examination, the patient holds the right hip flexed and externally rotated. Passive range of motion of the right hip is limited by pain. An x-ray of the right hip shows no.\nabnormalities. His leukocyte count is 10,000/mm5, erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 15 mm/h, and serum C-reactive protein concentration is 1.5 mg/L (N=0.08-3.1). Which of the following is the most\nappropriate treatment for this patient?\nA) Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy\nC) Physical therapy for motion and strength\nE) Surgical debridement of the hip joint\nCorrect Answer: B.\nThe most likely diagnosis in this otherwise healthy patient is transient synovitis of the hip. Transient synovitis is an inflammatory condition involving the synovial lining of weight-bearing joints, with the hip being\ncommonly affected. It classically presents in children recovering from a viral infection. Symptoms include pain when bearing weight, antalgic gait, refusal to ambulate, tenderness over the affected joint, and pain\nelicited with range of motion. Vital signs are generally within normal limits, as are laboratory studies apart from increased markers of inflammation, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Antecedent viral infection\nhas been reported in up to 30% of cases of transient synovitis. Diagnosis involves the exclusion of emergent or urgent conditions, such as cellulitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and fracture. In this case, the patient\ndoes not exhibit symptoms of infection, and laboratory studies show a leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein within normal limits. Treatment is supportive and involves rest and\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If there is diagnostic uncertainty, arthrocentesis should be performed to exclude septic arthritis, along with imaging studies to assess for osteomyelitis or fracture.\nIncorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E.\nIntravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (Choice A) would be indicated in cases of septic arthritis or osteomyelitis. In this case, the patient most likely has transient synovitis of the hip as vital signs and results\nof laboratory studies are within normal limits. Initial broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy in cases of septic arthritis or osteomyelitis should include vancomycin because of its effectiveness against Staphylococcus\naureus.\nPhysical therapy for motion and strength (Choice C) is a conservative treatment option for hip pain. This patient likely has transient synovitis which often resolves in an acute to subacute time frame. Nonsteroidal\nanti-inflammatory drug therapy is the most appropriate treatment option for this patient due to the self-limiting nature of transient synovitis and prompt pain relief.\nSerial hip joint aspirations (Choice D) is a treatment option for septic arthritis. After joint aspiration is performed, Gram stain and culture can be performed on the synovial fluid to evaluate for septic arthritis and to\ndetermine antibiotic sensitivities if the joint is found to be infected.\nSurgical debridement of the hip joint (Choice E) is also a treatment option for septic arthritis. It can be performed either initially or after joint aspiration if rapid improvement is not achieved. This patient's laboratory\nstudies and vital signs are within normal limits making transient synovitis the most likely diagnosis.\nEducational Objective: Transient synovitis is an inflammatory condition involving the synovial lining of weight-bearing joints, with the hip being frequently affected. Symptoms are transient and the most appropriate\ntreatment is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy. It is important to rule out emergent or urgent conditions, such as cellulitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and fracture.\na Cc @ € © e",

Sensitivity is the ability of a test to detect a disease if it is present. High sensitivity is\ntherefore useful in ruling out a disease. Sensitivity can be calculated by the equation: Sensitivity = (true positives) / (true positives + false negatives), or TP/(TP + FN). Specificity is the proportion of people who do\nnot have the disease who test negative. High specificity is useful in ruling in a disease. Specificity can be calculated by the equation: Specificity = (true negatives) / (true negatives + false positives), or TN / (TN +\nFP). LR, sensitivity, and specificity are all independent of disease prevalence, although they are impacted by the severity of the disease under study (with more severe diseases being easier to detect). Some\nstatistical measures, including positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), are impacted by disease prevalence. In this example, the screening test for alcohol use shows a high degree of\nsensitivity and specificity, which suggests that its proportion of TP and TN results is high in comparison to its proportion of FP and FN results.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Renal artery stenosis causes secondary hypertension related to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Low afferent blood flow to the affected kidney leads to abnormal stimulation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus and excessive production of renin. Renin converts\nangiotensinogen to angiotensin |, which is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the pulmonary vasculature. Angiotensin Il is a potent vasoconstrictor that directly mediates systemic hypertension via increased sodium reabsorption in the renal tubules,\naldosterone and vasopressin release, increased adrenergic tone, and stimulation of hypothalamic thirst centers. In younger patients, fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis, while in older patients it is typically caused by atherosclerosis. This patient likely has\nbilateral renal artery stenosis due to atherosclerosis, as evidenced by his history of carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass grafting. An abdominal bruit may be appreciated in the region of the stenosis. Diagnosis is established with renal artery Doppler ultrasonography or MRI, which\ncan quantify the degree of renal artery stenosis and associated kidney atrophy. Treatment involves angioplasty or stenting of the stenosed renal artery to improve flow. ACE inhibitors can be considered for unilateral stenosis. In the setting of bilateral renal artery stenosis, however, use of ACE\ninhibitors will decrease systemic hypertension but will lead to acute kidney failure, as evidenced by the acutely increased serum urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations in this patient following initiation of lisinopril.",

She has the sensation of incomplete emptying of the bladder unless\nshe pushes the mass back into her vagina. During the past 5 years, she has had increased pelvic pressure with prolonged standing or lifting. She does not have urine loss when coughing or laughing. She has no history of serious.\nillness and takes no medications. All her pregnancies ended in uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. The patient is 160 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 50 kg (110 Ib); BMI is 20 kg/m2 Vital signs are within normal limits. A photograph of the\nmass is shown. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Bartholin gland cyst\n\nC) Leiomyoma uteri\n\nD) Urethral diverticulum\n\nE) Uterine sarcoma\nCorrect Answer: B.\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) occurs secondary to pelvic floor dysfunction and weakness, resulting in herniation of abdominopelvic organs which causes mass effect and protrusion along the vaginal wall. The herniation of these pelvic organs\ncan lead to pelvic pressure, as well as urinary, defecatory, and sexual dysfunction. POP is a spectrum of diseases, with complete procidentia being a severe form that includes herniation of the entire anterior, posterior, and apical vaginal\n‘compartments through the introitus. The patient will have a degree of cystocele (ie, bladder prolapse), rectocele (ie, rectal prolapse), and enterocele (ie, intestinal prolapse), respectively, as a result of the descent of the pelvic organs. In these\nextreme cases, the cervix and uterus may be entirely or partially visible at the introitus. However, patients can have less severe forms with isolated prolapse, such as the cystocele seen in this patient. Cystocele is common in multiparous\npatients and is associated with stress or overflow urinary incontinence and the inability to fully empty the bladder. In severe cystoceles, the anterior vaginal wall may hemniate through the introitus, leading to a palpable or visible mass at the\nintroitus that may enlarge as intra-abdominal pressure increases. Other risk factors for POP include advancing age and obesity. Diagnosis of POP is made through a complete physical examination, and treatment includes pelvic floor\nexercises, vaginal pessaries, and surgical repair.\nIncorrect Answers: A, C, D, and E.\nBartholin gland cyst (Choice A) is caused by an obstruction of a Bartholin gland, one of which is located on each side of the introitus and provides secretions that lubricate the vagina. It presents with a small area of painful, fluctuant swelling\n‘over the posterior aspect of the labium majus. With ongoing obstruction and inflammation, infection and Bartholin gland abscess can develop. It would not be expected to cause a mass that protrudes from the introitus with increased intra-\nabdominal pressure, nor would it be expected to cause an inability to empty the bladder.\nLeiomyoma uteri (Choice C) are common benign tumors of the uterine smooth muscle. When symptomatic, they can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain, or reproductive dysfunction. Physical examination shows an enlarged,\nirregularly shaped uterus. They are estrogen-responsive and thus typically decrease in size with menopause. As they are formed from the uterine myometrium, it would be unlikely that they would be visible at the introitus, especially in this\nPatient who is postmenopausal.\nUrethral diverticulum (Choice D) is a small outpouching of the urethra that presents with recurrent urinary tract infections, urethritis, urinary incontinence, and incomplete bladder emptying. It would not cause the large external pelvic mass\n‘seen on this patient.\nUterine sarcoma (Choice E) is a rare uterine cancer that typically develops from the myometrium or connective tissue of the uterus. Symptoms include abnormal uterine bleeding, abdominopelvic pain, pelvic pressure, and abdominal\ndistension. This patient has no uterine bleeding or abdominopelvic pain. Additionally, as the sarcoma is formed from the uterine tissues, it would be unlikely to be visibly extruding from the vaginal introitus.\nEducational Objective: Pelvic organ prolapse occurs secondary to pelvic floor dysfunction weakness, which results in the herniation of abdominopelvic organs through the vaginal wall. Complete procidentia is a severe form of pelvic organ\nprolapse that includes herniation of the entire anterior, posterior, and apical vaginal compartments through the introitus, although less severe forms with isolated prolapse of individual organs can occur. One example is a cystocele, which is\ncaused by herniation of the bladder through the anterior vaginal wall, most commonly in multiparous patients. It is associated with stress or overflow incontinence, pelvic pressure, and the inability to fully empty the bladder. In severe cases, it\n‘can cause herniation of the anterior vaginal wall through the introitus.\n\n0 C ¢ @ 6 © ©",

The breakdown of skeletal muscle myocytes results in the release of myoglobin and creatine kinase into systemic circulation. Increased creatine kinase activity can be used as a marker to evaluate for the presence and progression\nof rhabdomyolysis. The abnormal release of myoglobin can cause nephrotoxicity, leading to an acute kidney injury from acute tubular necrosis. This patient has electrolyte derangements including hyperkalemia, also common in rhabdomyolysis, as intracellular\nions are released to the interstitial space and ultimately returned to circulation. Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, and hypocalcemia are common disturbances in rhabdomyolysis. Treatment of rhabdomyolysis requires supportive care and\nintravenous fluid hydration, making the administration of intravenous 0.9% saline the most appropriate next step for this patient. This intervention will assist in the clearance of myoglobin from the kidneys plus restoration of normal electrolyte balance, limiting\nnephrotoxicity.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "Given that this patient arrives to the emergency department (ED) with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and is unarousable, the most appropriate next step in management is intravenous administration of 3% saline. The goal of this administration is to restore\neunatremia as acute hyponatremia is the likely precipitant of the seizure. Caution must be taken when considering the rate at which to administer hypertonic saline. A rapid increase in serum sodium concentration in a patient with chronic hyponatremia can\ncause osmotic demyelination syndrome (QDS), also known as central pontine myelinolysis. For patients with acute hyponatremia, this is less of a concern of ODS, though it must be taken into consideration. According to the American Society of Nephrology, the\nsafe rate of correction for chronic hyponatremia is generally considered to be less than 12 mEq/L in 24 hours or less than 18 mEq/L in 48 hours. However, when the serum sodium concentration is less than 120 mEq/L, the correction should not exceed 8 mEq/L\nin 24 hours to avoid ODS. When acute neurologic symptoms are present, initial correction should only be to the point where neurologic symptoms resolve, followed by slow gradual correction to reach eunatremia thereafter. In general, a bolus of hypertonic\nsaline sufficient to raise the serum sodium by 4-6 mEq/L is enough to prevent further neurologic symptoms, such as seizures, though this number is clinically variable. Treatment should be targeted to the patient's specific signs and symptoms. Paraneoplastic\nsyndromes, such as inappropriate ADH (vasopressin) secretion, should be a suspected diagnosis given this patient’s ED presentation, history of small cell carcinoma of the lung, and hyponatremia on initial laboratory studies.",

In patients presenting with severe hyponatremia, such as those with confusion, stroke-like symptoms,\nor seizures, as seen in this patient, prompt correction of hyponatremia is paramount and should be accomplished with intravenous hypertonic saline. To minimize the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome, the serum sodium should only be corrected to the\npoint of resolution of acute neurologic symptoms, with slow gradual correction to reach eunatremia in the coming days to weeks.

Early decelerations are defined as a gradual decrease in the heart rate that nadirs more than 30 seconds after the initiation of heart rate decline. The nadir of heart rate occurs at the same time as the peak of the uterine\ncontraction. Early decelerations are typically caused by fetal head compression during normal uterine contractions. In contrast, variable decelerations are defined as an abrupt decrease in heart rate of at least 15 bpm that last at\nleast 15 seconds, but less than 2 minutes. They do not show a specific relation to the uterine contraction tracing. They are caused by umbilical cord compression that results in decreased blood flow to the fetus, an increased\nperipheral systemic vascular resistance, and an autonomic response of fetal bradycardia. Short periods of minimal variability may also occur when the fetus is in a sleep cycle.

Breath sounds are decreased because of reduced airflow and a prolonged expiratory phase as the pathologically\nnarrowed airways are further compressed by positive intrathoracic pressure during expiration. Heart sounds may be distant secondary to emphysematous lung\nchanges (eg, sound is transmitted poorly through air relative to normal lung tissue). Pulmonary abnormalities can be evaluated by pulmonary function testing, which\nincludes spirometry, full-body plethysmography, single-breath diffusing capacity, arterial blood gas analysis, and pulse oximetry. Spirometry is the most useful in\ndiagnosing obstructive lung disease, which is defined by a decrease in the ratio of the volume of air forcefully expelled in the first second of expiration to the total\nvolume of air expelled during the expiratory phase (FEV,/FVC). The severity of obstruction is graded by the amount of FEV, reduction compared to predicted values.\nTreatment is focused on smoking cessation and supplemental oxygen to decrease mortality.

Typical laboratory findings in CML include\nhyperleukocytosis, which is present in this case, with an increase in nearly all the myeloid cell lines. Peripheral blood smear will show a diverse array of immature and partially mature cells of the granulocytic\nlineage with basophilia. Leukostasis, a condition in which hyperleukocytosis leads to end-organ damage from occlusion of capillaries by malignant, non-distensible cells, is uncommon in CML because malignant\ncells are well-differentiated and pliable. This contrasts with conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia, in which circulating blasts, which are large and not particularly pliable,\neasily lodge in capillaries to cause pulmonary and neurologic complications. Treatment of CML is primarily with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib or dasatinib and routine laboratory monitoring.

In contrast, genital\nherpes and chancroid, caused by herpesvirus 2 and Haemophilus ducreyi, respectively, are both characterized by painful genital ulcers. Primary syphilis causes a shallow\nchancre with a clean base that may be associated with inguinal lymphadenopathy, which makes it the most likely diagnosis in this patient with multiple sexual partners.\nUntreated syphilis develops in multiple stages with varying symptoms, including primary with a painless chancre as described, secondary with fever, lymphadenopathy, and\ncondylomata lata, and tertiary with neurosyphilis, tabes dorsalis, aortitis, and gummas. Serologic testing for syphilis is first performed with a nontreponemal test, such as a\nvenereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test or rapid plasma reagin (RPR). During the early phases of primary syphilis, VDRL test and RPR may be negative, as in this\ncase. If there is ongoing clinical concem, the RPR should be repeated. These tests are typically performed as a screening test, and if positive, should be followed up with a\ntreponemal test, such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test. Infection in pregnant patients can lead to neonatal abnormalities, such as\nhepatomegaly, rhinitis, maculopapular rash, epitrochlear lymphadenopathy, and chorioretinitis, and thus, pregnant patients should be treated for syphilis expeditiously.\nTreatment consists of benzathine penicillin G, making this the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient.",

When the power of a study is increased, the incidence of a\ntype Il error decreases.

However, meta-analyses are susceptible to\ntheir own errors, primarily related to inclusion criteria, statistical methods, and the errors of constituent studies. The meta-analysis in this example provides a forest plot, which is a commonly used method of summarizing the results\nof multiple studies in a single graphical representation.

These tumors\ncan produce hormones and vasoactive substances that are released into the bloodstream, causing symptoms of flushing, diarrhea, and shortness of breath. The substance most commonly\nproduced by carcinoid tumors is serotonin. However, other substances may include histamine, bradykinin, prostaglandins, substance P, and chromogranin, which can also contribute to\nsymptoms. Typical patient presentation includes episodic flushing, diarrhea, and occasionally, shortness of breath. However, most carcinoid tumors are not identified until they are metastatic.\nGastrointestinal carcinoid tumors must metastasize beyond the liver to produce symptoms, as symptoms are negated when serotonin is broken down by the liver. However, in this patient's case\nwhere the tumor is in the lung (either a primary tumor or potentially a metastasis), symptoms are present. Diagnostic studies typically include urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)\nconcentration measurement, which will generally be increased.

For example, the lung parenchyma typically loses\nits scaffolding, leading to dilation of air spaces, known as senile emphysema. Alveolar dead space also increases. Smoking increases the rate of age-related decline.\nSmoking cessation is the most likely intervention to prevent worsening of this patient's obstructive lung disease. Long-term smokers are at risk of numerous diseases of the\nlung including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is diagnosed by spirometry. This patient, with a prolonged expiratory phase, may have smoking- and age-\nrelated lung decline or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Further diagnostic testing is needed to determine the diagnosis. Other common symptoms include dyspnea\non exertion and productive cough. Treatment focuses on preventing further decline in respiratory function through smoking cessation in addition to the use of medications,\nsuch as inhaled antimuscarinics, short and long-acting B-adrenergic agonists, and corticosteroids. Patients with resting or ambulatory saturation less than 88% are also\ncandidates for oxygen therapy.\nIncorrect Answers: B, C, D, and E.\n\"In 5 years, your risk for lung cancer will decrease to that of a nonsmoker\" (Choice B) and \"Your risk for lung cancer will be the same as it is now\" (Choice D) are inaccurate.\nThe patient's lung cancer risk will remain increased compared to the general population because of his smoking history. However, his future risk will decrease if he quits\nsmoking compared to if he continues smoking.\n“Your pulmonary function will not decrease further in the future\" (Choice C) is inaccurate. Age-related pulmonary function decline typically begins around age 25 years.\nDilation of air spaces and increased alveolar space commonly occur with age.\n“Your risk for myocardial infarction will be higher than that of a nonsmoker for the rest of your life, but your risk for cerebral infarction will decrease\" (Choice E) accurately\ndescribes the patient's myocardial infarction risk but not his cerebral infarction risk. Smoking history increases cerebral infarction risk. Smoking increases risk of\natherosclerotic buildup in both the coronary and intracranial arteries.\nEducational Objective: In normal aging, air spaces dilate and alveolar dead space increases. Smokers should be encouraged to stop smoking as this intervention is the\nmost likely to prevent an increased rate of age-related pulmonary decline.\na C @ @ € © m",

As the mother has no signs of hemolysis in the presence of anti-Kell antibodies, her RBCs do not have\nKell antigens, and she would not have contributed a Kell antigen to her fetus. The easiest way to determine the antigen status of the fetus is to determine the antigen status of the father.

After\nsufficient treatment of his pneumonia and urinary tract infection, the patient is no longer showing evidence of hallucinations. At this point, it is appropriate to assess the patient's mental status to\nevaluate his capacity and ability to take care of himself. Since he was then unable to recall any items after 5 minutes, this should raise concern that the patient has significant cognitive deficits and\nwould not likely be safe to live at home on his own.

Presentation of degenerative disc disease commonly includes pain that worsens with\nflexion and on Valsalva maneuver, coughing, or sneezing. It is important to evaluate for signs of radiculopathy including sensory deficits, deep tendon reflex changes, or muscle weakness.\nPhysical examination tests to evaluate for radiculopathy include the straight-leg raise with a positive result being reproduction of pain into the leg.

Due\nto damage to the glomerular filtration barrier, large proteins such as albumin are filtered into the urine causing hypoalbuminemia. To counteract the low serum oncotic pressure caused by\nurinary protein losses, the liver produces lipoproteins leading to hyperlipidemia. A biopsy of membranous nephropathy usually shows diffuse thickening of the glomerular capillary wall, and\non immunofluorescence, IgG deposition along the glomerular basement membrane. Electron microscopy also shows subepithelial deposits. Membranous nephropathy is the most common\nnephrotic syndrome in White adults and can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune disease against phospholipase A2\nreceptors, chronic hepatitis infection (especially hepatitis B or C virus), or pharmaceuticals such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or penicillamine. Untreated, it may progress to\nchronic kidney failure. The addition of an ACE inhibitor such as lisinopril to the patient's regimen results in decreased angiotensin || production, which causes relative efferent arteriole\ndilatation. This decreases constriction of the efferent arteriole, decreasing glomerular filtration pressure and reducing hyperfiltration injury of the glomerulus, resulting in delayed progression\nof the patient's nephropathy.",

ITT analysis is useful for preserving the integrity of randomization and for limiting the effects of certain forms of bias, particularly attrition bias, that may result from patients who did not receive treatment, who received the wrong\ntreatment, or who stopped treatment early or dropped out from the study. In the example scenario, the two randomized groups differ greatly in the number of patients who received the intended treatment (400 out of 500 in the experimental group,\ncompared with 50 out of 500 in the conventional group).

Symptoms include the rapid onset of\nbronchospasm with dyspnea or wheezing, urticaria, flushing, nausea and emesis, edematous lips and tongue, and hypotension with tachycardia. When severe and untreated, it can progress to circulatory collapse with cardiovascular arrest or death\ndue to asphyxiation and airway obstruction. Stridor, present in this case, suggests the presence of glottic or subglottic angioedema and is a warning sign of impending loss of the airway. Treatment begins with urgent administration of epinephrine,\nfollowed by antihistamines, bronchodilators, glucocorticoids, and intravenous fluids. Severe cases may require endotracheal intubation and the administration of vasopressors. This patient consumed a granola bar that likely contained traces of an\nallergen, leading to an anaphylactic reaction with her symptoms of dyspnea, urticaria, and stridor.

Bulimia nervosa is characterized by cycles of uncontrollable eating and compensatory purging behaviors,\nsuch as vomiting, and overuse of laxatives, or diuretics that occur at least once a week for 3 months or more. Unlike patients with anorexia nervosa, patients with bulimia nervosa typically have a BMI in the healthy weight range and do not\nexperience amenorrhea. Physical examination of patients with a binge eating/purging type of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa can show dental caries from gastric hydrochloric acid erosion of enamel, parotid gland swelling from salivary gland\noverstimulation, and scars on the knuckles secondary to abrasions from the incisors when inducing vomiting. The loss of gastric hydrochloric acid through vomiting can lead to hypochloremia and metabolic alkalosis. Alternatively, when laxatives\nare overused, either metabolic alkalosis or non—anion gap metabolic acidosis can occur. Metabolic acidosis occurs commonly secondary to the loss of bicarbonate in the stool. Hypokalemia is common secondary to potassium wasting in the stool.\nIn severe cases of bulimia nervosa, signs of hypovolemia, such as tachycardia and hypotension (eg, this patient's orthostatic hypotension), may be present. Hypovolemia leads to increased aldosterone concentrations, resulting in further potassium\nsecretion. As potassium is involved in the membrane potential of muscle cells (including skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscles), hypokalemia typically leads to general weakness, muscle cramps, fatigue, palpitations, and/or decreased\ngastrointestinal motility. Treatment of bulimia nervosa is through a combined medical and psychiatric approach and involves correcting fluid and electrolyte imbalances alongside behavioral and pharmacologic therapy.",

In this patient, gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, is\ndosed intravenously for UTI and sepsis. Aminoglycosides work synergistically with penicillins, meaning that the combined effect of the two classes is stronger than the effect of either class alone. However, gentamicin is ototoxic, nephrotoxic, and\nneurotoxic, making it suboptimal when alternatively suitable and safer medications are available. Measurement of plasma aminoglycoside trough concentrations will help reduce the risk for nephrotoxicity and acute kidney failure by preventing\noverdose or supratherapeutic concentrations of gentamicin. The trough concentration of a drug occurs immediately prior to the next dose and reflects the nadir of serum concentration, which is a function of redistribution into tissues plus drug\nmetabolism.",

Many medical organizations, such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force, make recommendations on appropriate screening recommendations for patients based on\ntheir age, sex, and risk factors. While screening examinations and tests can lead to the prevention of or early diagnosis of disease, they can also lead to additional, unnecessary testing and invasive procedures, so the benefits must outweigh the\nharms when applying each screening test to an individual patient. While other categories exist, most screening recommendations can be grouped into two: cardiovascular risk assessment and cancer screening. For example, most adult patients are\nscreened for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and undergo colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening. Female patients are screened for cervical cancer starting at age 21 years and breast cancer starting at age 40 to 50 years. Alll patients with\nspecific risk factors (eg, tobacco use, environmental exposures) are routinely screened for the development of lung cancer. For this specific patient, the most appropriate screening test is a measurement of fasting serum glucose concentration to rule\nout type 2 diabetes mellitus. Testing with a fasting serum glucose concentration or hemoglobin A, is recommended in patients aged 35 to 70 years who are overweight or obese, as well as in those who have concurrent hypertension or\nhyperlipidemia.

It is the most common carpal bone to be fractured with the likely mechanism of injury being a fall onto an outstretched hand.

On physical examination, pain can be reproduced with palpation of the scaphoid between the extensor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis\ntendons which is commonly referred to as the anatomical snuffbox. The scaphoid is at risk for nonunion or necrosis with proximal pole fractures as the blood supply of the scaphoid arrives distally from a branch off the\nradial artery. X-ray is the most appropriate initial imaging. In cases of unremarkable x-ray findings despite high clinical suspicion for scaphoid injury, repeat x-rays after 2 to 3weeks can be performed as initial imaging may\nnot show the fracture. In such cases, the injury should be preemptively immobilized until repeat imaging. Treatment for nondisplaced scaphoid fractures is generally nonoperative with immobilization.

In its early stages, it causes erythema chronicum migrans, which is an expanding rash with a\ncentral ring-like clearing. It can also be associated with a flu-like illness and arthralgia. The diagnosis can be established clinically in patients with a known tick exposure and the characteristic rash. However, serum testing for antibodies to B.\nburgdorferi can be useful when the diagnosis is uncertain, or for patients who lack a confirmed history of tick exposure or erythema chronicum migrans. Testing usually involves both ELISA and Western blot techniques. Serologic testing is often\nnegative in the early phases of the disease if antibodies have not yet developed. The early stages of Lyme disease can be treated with doxycycline, which acts by preventing the attachment of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes. Adverse effects of\ntetracycline antibiotics include gastrointestinal distress, photosensitivity, and, in children, discoloration of teeth and inhibition of bone growth, which contraindicates the use of doxycycline for pregnant patients. Later stages of Lyme disease are\ncharacterized by carditis, atrioventricular heart block, facial nerve palsy (which is often bilateral), and migratory arthralgias. If left untreated, encephalopathy and chronic arthritis may develop. The later stages of Lyme disease that affect the heart or\ncentral nervous system are generally treated with parenteral ceftriaxone.",

Epithelioid sarcoma may subclinically spread along the deeper\nanatomical structures including tendons, nerves, and fascia.

Failure to thrive is commonly defined as a persistent weight at or below the 5th percentile for age and sex, although a variety of other definitions are employed. Failure to thrive in an infant should prompt\nevaluation for the underlying cause. Common causes include inadequate nutritional intake (due to insufficient breastfeeding, inappropriate diet, poverty, neglect), malabsorption (due to cystic fibrosis, pancreatic insufficiency, cow milk allergy, or\ngastrointestinal malformations), or increased metabolic demand (due to congenital cardiac, pulmonary, or kidney malformations, hyperthyroidism, or malignancy). In this patient, paucity of subcutaneous fat and thin hair, along with light-colored stools,\nraises suspicion for cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the CFTR gene, leading to a deficiency in a chloride channel that secretes chloride in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract and reabsorbs\nchloride in sweat glands. This abnormal chloride transport causes decreased chloride and water secretion and increased water reabsorption, leading to abnormally viscous mucus. The thick mucus in the gastrointestinal tract contributes to pancreatic\ninsufficiency, steatorrhea, and malabsorption, leading to a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. In the lungs, the disease manifests as recurrent pneumonia, especially with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nObstruction and destruction of the airways leads to hypoxemia, air trapping, and bronchiectasis. The absence of the digestive enzymes made by the pancreas leads to malnutrition (eg, cachexia, muscle wasting), weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and\nfrequent, loose, foul-smelling, sometimes oily stools (steatorrhea).

Under normal conditions, increases in serum osmolarity are detected by\nthe hypothalamus, resulting in increased secretion of vasopressin and in increased thirst, resulting in the retention of free water in the kidneys and in increased water intake, respectively. Hypernatremia occurs most often in elderly patients, typically during an acute\nillness where mobility and access to water may be impaired, or where altered mental status or impaired thirst response may limit water intake. Hypernatremia may also occur in the setting of a variety of conditions that cause loss of both free water and electrolytes and\nresulting in hypotonic fluid loss, such as in the setting of diuretic use, severe diarrhea, or nasogastric suctioning or gastrointestinal fluid drains. Patients typically present with altered mental status and clinical evidence of volume depletion (eg, tachycardia, hypotension,\northostasis, poor skin turgor, dry mucous membranes). The diagnosis is established with serum chemistry, which can also identify other electrolyte abnormalities. Evaluation for underlying infections that may have precipitated the episode (such as with chest x-ray and\nurinalysis) is important. Given this patient's negative infectious workup, itis likely that her symptoms were caused by physical debilitation, limiting her access to water, exacerbated by the use of furosemide. Results of laboratory studies show hypernatremia,\nhyperkalemia, hyperchloremia, alkalosis, and increased serum urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations, consistent with volume contraction and prerenal azotemia. Treatment is with correction of volume depletion. Isotonic crystalloid infusion with 0.9% saline (which\ncontains 154 mEq/L of sodium) is preferable, as this will correct volume depletion while causing minimal risk for overly rapid correction of hypernatremia. The rate of correction is dependent on the suspected duration of hypernatremia. Acute hypernatremia of less than\n24 hours duration can be corrected rapidly, while more chronic hypernatremia should be corrected slowly at a maximum rate of approximately 10 mEq/day to avoid cerebral edema.",

Mature cystic teratomas are benign tumors of the ovary. They contain tissue derived\nfrom all three germ cell layers, and as a result, contain differentiated structures, such as hair, bone, or teeth.

Bacterial proliferation causes leukocytosis, such as in this patient,\nwhich is predominantly neutrophilic. Patients often develop fever and may also experience nausea and anorexia. When uncertain, the diagnosis can be confirmed with CT scan, MRI, or\nultrasonography. Treatment involves administration of intravenous antibiotics and operative intervention, typically laparoscopic appendectomy, to prevent appendiceal rupture, which can lead to\nperitonitis or an intra-abdominal abscess.

      "correct_answer_explanation": "This patient's symptoms of transient monocular vision loss, headache, fatigue, and proximal extremity weakness are consistent with temporal arteritis. Temporal arteritis is an autoimmune inflammatory vasculitis of medium\nand large vessels. Once temporal arteritis is suspected, treatment with a high-dose corticosteroid such as prednisone should occur immediately to preserve vision. Classic symptoms include fever, chills, weight loss,\nheadache, history of preceding transient vision loss (amaurosis fugax), jaw claudication, tenderness of the scalp, and pale optic disc edema. Temporal arteritis most commonly affects the vessels of the head and neck,\nparticularly the ophthalmic artery, inflammatory occlusion of which can result in sudden, ischemic damage to the retina. Once vision loss occurs, it is irreversible and commonly followed by vision loss in the contralateral eye\nwithin days or weeks. Notably, ophthalmic examination may detect no abnormalities before irreversible arterial occlusion has occurred. New onset of headaches in an elderly patient should raise suspicion for temporal\narteritis. Temporal arteritis frequently occurs in association with polymyalgia rheumatica, which is characterized by stiffness of proximal muscles, as in this case. Laboratory studies show thrombocytosis and increased\ninflammatory markers, including ESR and C-reactive protein. Duplex ultrasonography may show reduced flow within inflamed vessels. The diagnosis is confirmed with biopsy of the temporal artery showing granulomatous\nvasculitis. Corticosteroid treatment does not generally compromise biopsy results if the biopsy is performed within 1 to 2 weeks.",

Typically, approximately 5 minutes of\ncardiopulmonary collapse is enough to lead to brain death. According to the American Academy of Neurology, brain death is the permanent loss of all brainstem functions. Brain death commonly occurs after an acute\ncatastrophic brain injury secondary to intracranial trauma, cardiovascular collapse, or intracranial hemorrhage (likely in this case). Brain death can be diagnosed by a neurologic examination (showing absent cranial nerve\nreflexes and a lack of response to painful stimuli) and an apnea test (showing the absence of respiratory drive). This patient does not respond to painful stimuli, making brain death likely; the patient also has a do-not-\nattempt resuscitation (DNAR) order. In a patient without an advance directive that involves a DNAR order, CPR may be attempted immediately after the onset of asystole, particularly if brain death is not already evident.\nHowever, this patient's advance directive precludes the use of CPR.

PVD is common among older, male smokers with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hypertipidemia. The diagnosis is suggested\nby absent or diminished peripheral pulses, hairless legs with smooth skin that may ulcerate, and is further supported by a reduced ABI. The ABI is a noninvasive means of assessing for PVD and can be performed in the clinic. It is commonly calculated by dividing the systolic blood pressure in the lower\nextremity at the ankle by the systolic blood pressure in the arm at the level of the brachial artery. A ratio of less than 0.9 indicates the presence of occlusive arterial vascular disease while a ratio between 0.9 and 1.3 is suggestive of normal arteries. An ABI above 1.3 likely indicates the presence of\ncalcified vessels and necessitates further evaluation for vascular disease. All patients with confirmed PVD should be started on a statin and antiplatelet agent, such as aspirin, for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. Exercise programs are often effective in improving exercise tolerance,\nincreasing neovascularization and collateral flow, and diminishing symptoms.",

This can result in persistent\nand severe hypoxia despite management with positive end-expiratory pressure and increased fraction of inspired oxygen.
