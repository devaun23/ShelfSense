In patients with a history of remote tuberculosis exposure with faded immune memory, an initial PPD test may provide a false negative result. However, exposure to tuberculin will boost immune memory and stimulate a positive result on the second PPD test. Two-step PPD testing is not necessary for routine PPD testing of non-high-risk patients. Obtaining cultures of three induced sputum samples for acid-fast bacilli (Choice C) is useful for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in a patient with suspected primary or latent tuberculosis. This patient's PPD result is negative and should not prompt further diagnostic evaluation. Beginning isoniazid and pyridoxine therapy (Choice D) or beginning isoniazid therapy only (Choice F) would be appropriate during a 9-month course for the treatment of latent tuberculosis. Patients at risk for pyridoxine deficiency or peripheral neuropathy may benefit from therapy with isoniazid plus pyridoxine to reduce the risk for peripheral neuropathy related to vitamin Be (pyridoxine) deficiency. Beginning isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol therapy (Choice E) is appropriate for the treatment of active primary or recurrent tuberculosis. Educational Objective: PPD skin testing stimulates a T-cell driven type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction against subdermal tuberculin antigen and is useful for the detection of latent tuberculosis infection. lnduration exceeding 15 mm is considered a positive result for a PPD skin test in patients with no risk factors for tuberculosis. lnduration exceeding 10 mm is considered a positive result for high risk patients. lnduration exceeding 5 mm is considered positive for immunocompromised patients. ti https://t.me/USMLENBME2CK Previous Next Score Report Lab Values Calculator Help pause Exam Section 4: Item 46 of 50 National Board of Medical Examiners Comprehensive Clinical Science Self-Assessment Y 2s.
